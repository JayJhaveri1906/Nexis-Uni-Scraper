NATALIE ALLEN, CNN ANCHOR: Pushing pause, states across the U.S. scale back on reopening as the country records its highest ever number of new coronavirus cases in one day.
First, Ebola now COVID, just as Congo declares victory over the world's second deadliest Ebola outbreak. It's now facing round two with the coronavirus. We'll have a live report about that.
Also racing and racism. What former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has to say about racism in this popular sport.
We're live from CNN world headquarters in Atlanta. Welcome to our viewers here in United States, and around the world. I'm Natalie Allen, and this is CNN Newsroom.
Thank you for joining us.
The United States confirmed 40,000 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday. It was the highest one day surged by far. Some hospitals are already nearing critical mass, and more and more young people are falling ill.
That will be the dark cloud hanging over the White House Coronavirus Task Force on Friday. Its first public briefing in two months. Johns Hopkins University has logged more than 2.4 million cases in the U.S. but the actual number could be 10 times higher, 24 million.
Doctor Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control says for every confirmed case, there are roughly 10 others who go undetected because they have mild or no symptoms.
With infections now clearly on the rise in more than 30 states and huge states like California, Texas, Florida all having record spikes, it is no wonder several governors are hitting the brakes on reopening any further.
And it's not just the U.S., this normally happy summer beach in Bournemouth, England was the nightmare scenario health experts most feared in the middle of this pandemic. Local officials declared a major concerned incident and begged everyone to leave.
As U.S. cases surged to alarming levels the push to reopen is getting pushed back from some state governors.
We get more about it from CNN's Nick Watt.
NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Partiers packed this Fort Worth bar Saturday night, but the reopening of the lone star state is now on hold. As case counts climb at record rates and hospitals fill up.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MAYOR RON NIRENBERG, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS: If this acceleration continues unabated, we're going to find ourselves overwhelmed.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: Nevada, North Carolina and Louisiana also now pumping the brakes on reopening.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D-LA): I think these numbers made crystal clear the correctness of the decision not to move forward.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: In California, Disneyland now won't reopen July 17th as planned.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): That is an example of the data informing decision-making.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: California and Florida along with Texas are reporting record high new case tanks. So, our three most populous states are going in the wrong direction fast. And they are home to more than a quarter of all Americans.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We have seen most of this case growth in those under 40 categories.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: A focus now in efforts to staunch the spread, younger asymptomatic spreaders.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ERIN BROMAGE, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH: We are seeing the infection rates especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona just skyrocketing that demographic.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: Arizona now has the most cases per capita in the entire country.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): There is no consideration of increasing activity. Arizona is on pause.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: The CDC just added pregnant women to the at risk Democratic. They say just over 5 percent of women with COVID-19 require hospitalization. For pregnant women, that sourced to over 30 percent. They also now say our actual infection rate might be 10 times the confirmed cases, so not around 2.4 million, but around 24 million. And they say that social distancing is now our most powerful weapon.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, PROFESSOR OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY: It is a time to normalize wearing masks and social distancing behavior is now. So that we get used to it by the time the fall arrives.
[03:05:02]
And I'm very concerned that the second wave this fall will be substantially greater than what we have experienced so far.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATT: The number we've really got to keep an eye on moving forward is hospitalizations. How many COVID-19 patients are in the hospital? And here in California, that's gone up by a third in just the past two weeks. A trend that the director of public health here in Los Angeles calls extraordinarily worrisome.
Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.
ALLEN: Joining me now in Los Angeles is Dr. Anish Mahajan, chief medical officer of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Doctor, thanks so much for joining us.
ANISH MAHAJAN, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER: Thank you.
ALLEN: Well, 15 counties there in California are seeing increases in COVID cases. How might this affect hospitals and capacity if this trend continues? What is the situation there where you are?
MAHAJAN: Well, we are certainly seeing a great -- an increase in hospitalizations in many of the counties in California. So, as you know, we are seeing increases in cases, and usually when you have increases in cases, 5 to 10 days afterwards you start to see increases in hospitalizations. This is happening all across California and it is very concerning.
ALLEN: The governor is resisting easing up on restrictions and also not mandating masks. We are seeing that in some other states with big issues. Do you agree with these decisions is now the time to get more aggressive?
MAHAJAN: Well, we know that masks save lives in COVID-19. There was a recent study out of Texas and a few other universities that have now definitively shown that wearing a mask protects others around you, but actually also protects you if you are an infected from contracting the virus. So, masks are a must but not enough.
We have seen reopening occurring all across the United States and one of the metrics that has to be followed when you are reopening is the number of cases you are having and the number of hospitalizations you are seeing from those cases.
Now we are seeing cases go up, we are seeing hospitalizations going up, which means that the epidemic and the virus is out of control again, and so we have to not only pause reopening, we need our leadership to say to themselves and to the public maybe we might even need to roll back some of the opening.
Because the cost in lives is too much. Even when our hospitals have the capacity to take on more COVID ICU patients, we in the healthcare system know that some 30 to 50 percent of patients who end up on a ventilator due to COVID, will die. We have to ask ourselves is this worth it?
ALLEN: Absolutely. And it's not just California, it is Florida, it is Texas, where one infectious disease expert warns the spike there is leading to apocalyptic surges in major Texas cities. We know the U.S. broke the record for the most cases reported in a single day Thursday. So, the question is, can we get a handle on this, doctor, and we also know that a lot of these cases we are seeing are younger people.
MAHAJAN: Right. You know, I think we all hope collectively that the summer heat would slow this virus down, and that we wouldn't see as much transmission. We also hope that as we reopened if people did wear their masks and did appropriately social distancing even while resuming their lives, that we wouldn't see as much transmission.
But the numbers don't lie. Look at what's happening all across the United States we are seeing cases rise and rise. And so, at this point we have to ask ourselves, what are we going to do about it? We have to, we really have to take a hard look at really wearing these masks and being very careful, and maybe even rolling back some of these reopening so we can get a handle on this. ALLEN: Right. One doctor in Florida liken not wearing a mask to driving on a highway, drunk without a seatbelt. So, what would you say to people at this point that are simply refusing to do these two very simple things -- social distance and wear a mask? And of course, we also know that from the very top with the U.S. president, he doesn't wear a mask, and even sometimes makes fun of it.
MAHAJAN: Well, I think it's a great metaphor that not wearing a mask is like driving drunk because when you drive drunk, you are risking other people's lives and your own. And now we know that masks work to protect others and protect yourself. And really, we have a number of young people now in the United States who have resumed their lives who may have COVID but are not going to get sick from it, but we know that they can transmit it.
[03:10:03]
And so, we need our young people to wear the mask so they don't actually get the virus when they're out and about and not give the virus to their other loved ones. To their loved ones who may be more susceptible to having bad outcomes if they do get COVID.
And leadership is the most important. Now we need the president, we need all of our leaders to speak in one voice and say that mask is essential, so say that we have to be careful about how we reopen, to say that we have to have appropriate testing supplies and contact tracing if we're going to get a handle on this.
ALLEN: And that's where we're at. I mean this is a moment that is so important. Are we going to be able to get a handle on it? You've got the European Union questioning whether they'll allow Americans or people in the U.S. to travel to Europe because it's so bad here. Did you ever imagine that United States could have it this bad? How did we have this so wrong, doctor?
MAHAJAN: Yes, it is really shocking for all of us and we should have done better and we went wrong probably right from the beginning when in the beginning we had the CDC unfortunately bungle the rollout of testing for COVID. We lost critical time in a very early stage before COVID became a big forest fire throughout our country and we never caught up.
And part of not catching up his leadership at the highest levels, saying to all of our governors, saying to all of our jurisdictions that let's have a national strategy for testing, let's have a national strategy for contact tracing and isolating people when they are effective.
Let's have a national strategy about reopening on each of these really important things, unfortunately, we did not come together as a nation whereas we see other nations like Taiwan, New Zealand, and many other examples where they did just that and they don't have as big a problem as we do.
ALLEN: Right, and look where we are now. Dr. Anish Mahajan, we really appreciate your expertise and your time. Thank you so much, and we wish you the best.
MAHAJAN: Thank you.
ALLEN: Well, E.U. officials are set to meet in the coming hours to decide which country citizens will be allowed to come in and which will not. As they reopen their borders, they may block visitors from nations with severe coronavirus outbreaks as I just mentioned, including the United States.
It comes even as the World Health Organization warns that Europe is seeing its cases increase for the first time in months.
Nic Robertson is in London for us this morning. And good morning to you, Nic. This is definitely a time for difficult decisions.
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Well, it really is, and the E.U. ambassadors will be meeting in about an hour's time in Brussels, face to face, because that's how important this issue is to them. The 27 nations gathering around in a single venue, in a single room.
What we are hearing from the WHO certainly is them bringing the alarm bells for Europe, I think one word of caution here, that when the E.U. says, or rather when the WHO talks about infections in Europe, that's it's map of Europe, its collection of European countries which doesn't quite mirror that of the European Union.
But what the World Health Organization is saying is very stark, that there are 30 countries that they see that have concerning figures that they are seeing something that is very significant across Europe, this turning trend to the point that in 11 countries they see very significant increases that in COVID-19 infections that if they aren't dealt with swiftly could potentially overwhelm the health services in those country.
Now perhaps one of the countries that saw the WHO list and is a member of the European Union, that would be Sweden there, but other countries that among those 11 that the WHO were worried about the Kosovo, they include Albania, they include Armenia, they include Bosnia and Herzegovina.
So there is a deep concern at the WHO and of course this is, you know, of a concern for the European Union as well as it tries to figure out what are those specific criteria that are going to determine who can come in and who can't come into Europe?
ALLEN: Yes. And on that question, Nic, so what specific criteria will the E.U. use in deciding whether to block travel from the United States?
ROBERTSON: Yes, there are three basic principles. The first one they say is reciprocity. So, if your country blocks E.U. citizens, then, automatically, you don't make the cut. Now the United States falls into that situation right now, very early on in March, President Trump stopped on mid-March, President Trump stopped flights coming from Europe, stopped European -- Europe E.U. nations traveling into the United States. So that's one point there.
[03:15:06]
The other second point, I think is one that certainly the United States is very familiar with and can overcome, this is the about travel and it's sort of safety of people why they are traveling. But then, the third stumbling block, really, for the United States, is that rate of infection.
The European Union's average rate of infection at the moment is 15 cases per 100,000, the United States is about 106.7 per 100,000. And the E.U. is likely to set a threshold at about 50,000. So again, that will be the second point where the United States doesn't make the cut, Natalie.
ALLEN: Well, and if the United States isn't going in the right direction to meet that threshold. All right. Nic Robertson in London, thank you very much, Nic.
In Latin America, the number of cases is still rising as well. Brazil recorded almost 40,000 more cases on Thursday, bringing its total to more than 1.2 million. You can see here the number of new cases per 100,000 people Brazil and Peru well ahead of even the United States.
With that, more than 1,100 people have died in Brazil in the last 24 hours, bringing that grim total to nearly 55,000.
The number of new cases is also rising across the Middle East. These are the latest numbers from Johns Hopkins. Iran, once the epicenter outside of China, still has the most reported cases in the region. Turkey follows with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, among the top five. But even countries not on this list are struggling with recent spikes.
For more on this, senior international correspondent, Arwa Damon is joining me now live from Turkey. Hello to you, Arwa. It's certainly this is yet another disturbing trend.
ARWA DAMON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It really is, Natalie. And some of it is due to countries starting to open up, and like we see elsewhere in the world, populations becoming a bit complacent.
If you look at some of the measures that are being taken, though, quite extraordinarily, especially when we look at Saudi Arabia, who, this year for the Haj, that is the annual pilgrimage that is a duty for every Muslim, is saying that it will only be accepting pilgrims who already reside inside the country or already located inside the country.
So, shutting it off to people coming from abroad. There is also great concern about Iran, which was once the epicenter of coronavirus in the Middle East, perhaps, possibly being at the beginning of a second wave. The government there imploring the population to continue to wash their hands, social distance, wear their masks. And then if we talk about Iraq, not quite yet on that list, but also a very worrying trend there too, with cases increasingly on the rise, and based on reports and people that we're talking to inside the country, you know, there are mass graves that are being dug there. Their hospitals are beginning to struggle, hospital staff especially, seemingly experiencing a very high infection rate.
The speaker of parliament came out and said that parliamentarians will no longer be able to meet as they used to because of a prevalence of cases. Not just among parliamentarians themselves but also among key staff within that government institution.
When it comes to Turkey, yes, Turkey is ranking fairly high on that list but Turkey has managed at this stage to stabilize these numbers. But I think what we are seeing just goes to underscore that no matter what stage of this a country is in, complacency is not something that anyone can afford.
And a lot of these countries that we're talking about in the Middle East, Natalie, such as Iran, Iraq, and Egypt, they don't necessarily have the infrastructure to be able to handle this.
If we again go back to Iraq as an example, the country's health infrastructure was decimated by the sanctions under Saddam Hussein, and then you had the U.S.-led invasion followed by consecutive years of warfare that took place. And the country never was actually able to rebuild its healthcare system.
So, if numbers in any of these places really spike to an even greater degree, the consequences are going to be quite devastating, Natalie.
ALLEN: Right. And we know the people of Iraq have been suffering so much economically as well. What a terrible situation. Thank you so much, senior international correspondent Arwa Damon for us in Istanbul.
Next here on CNN newsroom, the FBI has released a picture of that noose found in the garage of a black NASCAR driver. We look at how it could've been put there and why.
[03:19:59]
Also, Formula One is working to become more inclusive. The comments from the former head of the sport may not help. We'll have that interview, next.
ALLEN: Two million people demanding racial justice have prompted the governor of Colorado to order a new investigation into the death of a young black man in police custody. Twenty-three-year-old Elijah McClain was walking home from a store in the city of Aurora last August when three white officers stop him. Body cam footage shows what happens next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop. Stop. Stop. I have a right to stop you because you are being suspicious.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, OK.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Turn around, turn around, turn around.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALLEN: At one point, police put a chokehold on him, and later paramedics gave him a drug to sedate him. He suffered a heart attack and was declared brain dead three days later. None of the officers has faced any discipline or charges.
Governor Jared Polis is now asking the attorney general to reinvestigate the case after two million people signed a petition demanding this be looked at more closely.
NASCAR has released a photo of the noose found in the garage assigned to Bubba Wallace, the only African-American driver in the stock car racing association.
NASCAR's president says the photo shows the noose was real, as was his concern for Wallace. The FBI determine that no hate crime had been committed because the rope had been there since last year. NASCAR says all other garages were checked, but found a noose only in Wallace's. NASCAR was not able to determine who put it there or why it wasn't reported earlier.
Formula One kicks off its delayed season in little more than a week with the Austrian Grand Prix, at the same time the organization is working on a new initiative to try to make motorsport more inclusive. You would think everyone could get behind that. But the former Formula One boss seems to have different ideas on issues involving race.
Here is our interview with CNN's Amanda Davies.
AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORTS PRESENTER: Sixth-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton is the sports only black driver in a 70- year history. He's often talked about the challenges he's faced in his career because of the color of his skin. And in the wake of the death of George Floyd, he called out other members of the motorsport community for not speaking up against racial injustice.
He's decided to take matters into their own hands, launching the Hamilton Commission, a research partnership aimed at making motorsports more diverse and more multicultural.
[03:24:59]
And this week when I spoke to the man in charge of Formula One until 2017, the man dubbed as Mr. F1, because of his 40-year relationship with the sport, Bernie Ecclestone, he did praise Hamilton for his actions and talks of its importance for the sport, but he made what I think it's fair to say, was some pretty controversial comments. I began by asking him why he thinks F1 hasn't done more to tackle the issue of diversity in the past?
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
BERNIE ECCLESTONE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, FORMULA ONE: I don't think anyone is bothered with it before. They are too busy trying to win races, or find sponsors, or something. Really, other things are of little, if any, interest.
DAVIES: So, what impact do you think what Lewis has launched, the Hamilton Commission, what impact do you think that's going to have in real terms for Formula One?
ECCLESTONE: I don't think it's going to do anything bad or good for Formula One. It will just make people think. Which, is more important. I think it's the same for everybody. People want to think a little bit, and say, what the hell, somebody is not the same, not the same as white people that black and the black people should think the same thing about white people.
Because I think in lot of cases, black people are more racist than white people are.
DAVIES: What makes you say that?
ECCLESTONE: Well, things over the years, I've noticed. There's no need for it.
DAVIES: Is that not a case of fighting for equality and fighting against injustice for such a long time?
ECCLESTONE: Well, against injustice for anyone whatever color they are, it's important to do something about that for a start. But as, I mean, I don't think you are going to easily change people's attitude, I think they need to start being taught at school. So, they grow up not thinking about these things.
And I think it's completely stupid taking all these statues down. They should have left them there. Take the kids from school to look and say why they are and what the people did. And how wrong it was what they did.
DAVIES: As somebody who was so integral to making Formula One what it is today, do you not want to see it as a sport leading the way and changing attitudes, and portraying society as it is?
ECCLESTONE: I suppose the people that need to do that or the viewers. For the number of people that are directly involved in sport, there is such a small number of people that can do very little. I'm surprised, if anyone, in Formula One, certainly the teams and the people like the promoters, have any concern about this. I think it's the public at large that have to start thinking.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
DAVIES: Do you wonder what the sports or current owners will make of those comments. Echoes, and of course while still an influential figure in the F1 paddock, is no longer in charge. That's the liberty media group run by Chase Kerry. They, in recent days have launched a new initiative to tackle the issues around diversity and inclusion. The we races one campaign, including a task force to address the issues both on and off the track.
But set against the backdrop of the issues the Bubba Wallace has faced in NASCAR in recent weeks, now Bernie's comments there's no doubt, the scrutiny will be greater than ever on Formula One when the delayed season hits the track in Austria next weekend.
Amanda Davies, CNN, London.
ALLEN: Well, U.S. President Trump has work to do if he wants another four years on the White House. Next here, a half dozen new polls show Mr. Trump trailing Democrat Joe Biden. We'll have the latest numbers and talk with someone about what's next for President Trump in this race.
[03:30:00]
NATALIE ALLEN, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome back to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world, I'm Natalie Allen, you're watching CNN Newsroom, live from Atlanta. The United States on Thursday, recorded its highest single day rise in coronavirus infections, 40,000 people and many of them are young. The spiraling number of U.S. cases, now has President Trump struggling to play defense. This health crisis is confounding Trump's efforts to reverse his falling poll numbers and pursue his reelection campaign. For more on, it here's our chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: With coronavirus cases spiking and his poll numbers tanking. President Trump is chalking up the pandemic surge in the U.S. to increase covid-19 testing and nothing more. Tweeting the numbers of cases goes up because of great testing, while the numbers of death, mortality rate goes way down. But the president is signaling that the number of dead could continue to soar by the 10s of thousands.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It could've been stopped in China, but we could've lost anywhere from 2 to 4 million people as opposed to where it is now, which is probably 115, but it could get, you know, a little bit higher than that. It could go up to one 150, it could go beyond that.
ACOSTA: That's roughly 100,000 more deaths than what Mr. Trump predicted in April.
TRUMP: Now we are going towards 50, I'm hearing or 60,000 people. One is too many, and I've always say it. One is too many. But we are going towards 50 or 60,000 people.
ACOSTA: The president is still bristling that questions over wearing masks.
TRUMP: Why aren't you further away and why aren't you wearing a mask? I can take a step back. I mean, you are not social distancing based on your question.
ACOSTA: But hold on, in Ohio, Vice President Mike Pence was wearing a mask, and Texas where GOP governor Gregg Abbott is pausing his state's reopening, he said in a statement, I ask all Texas to do their part to slow the spread of covid-19 by wearing a mask, washing their hands regularly and socially distancing from others. In Florida, Republican Senator Marco Rubio is recommending mask to.
SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R-FL): Masks work. They reduce infection by up to 50 percent. It's not a big deal.
ACOSTA: Ever since the presidents disappointing weekend rally in Tulsa where thousands of empty seats were on display, dozens of secret service agents have now been forced under quarantine, as that agency is now asking his teams on presidential trips to undergo covid-19 testing. That is an addition to the Trump campaign staffers testing positive and now in quarantine as well. With 1.5 million new initial unemployment claims filed last week and more than 47 million since mid-March. The president is now trailing Joe Biden in critical states like Wisconsin, where a new poll finds the former Vice President with a strong lead.
JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's like a child, who cannot believe this has happened to him. All his whining, and self-pity. This pandemic didn't happen to him, it happened to all of us. And his job isn't to whine about it, his job is to do something about it.
ACOSTA: The president is banking on distractions to bail him out, like the protesters threatening to tear down statues across the U.S., as Mr. Trump is deploying U.S. marshals to protect this historic sites.
TRUMP: They're looking George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen. Nit going to happen. Not as long I'm here.
[03:35:10]
ACOSTA: Ex-aides like former National Security Adviser, John Bolton, say the president simply hasn't focused enough on the virus.
AMB. JOHN BOLTON, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: And he didn't want to hear about the potential impact of a pandemic on the American economy, and its effect on his reelection. Turning a blind eye to all these early signs.
ACOSTA: And we're learning the President Trump is walling himself off from bad polling, telling advisers he does not believe the latest poll showing he is trailing Joe Biden, and the president is pushing off public health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has not spoken to Mr. Trump in some three weeks. Aides are not hopeful the president will ever warm up to wearing masks. As one official told us quote, he will never change on the mask. Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ALLEN: Several recent polls show Mr. Trump likely Democratic challenger with a sizeable lead. One example here a survey from the New York Times in Sienna College has Joe Biden ahead of Mr. Trump by more than 10 points among registered voters. Let's get insight from Natasha Linstaedt in Colchester, England, she is a professor of government at the University of Ethics. Good morning, Natasha, thanks for coming on.
NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX, ENGLAND: Good morning. Thanks for having me.
ALLEN: Well, polls ended up being wrong in 2016 when Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton, but these numbers are certainly looking promising for Joe Biden. What is your reaction to them?
LINDSTAEDT: Well, they are really significant. I mean, a lot of it is that -- I just want to mention that this poll gets a very strong rating. And so, it's considered to be a very accurate poll. But the other big thing is that, this is by a much wider margin than any lead that Clinton had in 2016. And we need to look the result from some of the swing states like Michigan, like Pennsylvania, like Wisconsin. At this point Clinton had a very narrow lead in this stages and Trump won this states by a very narrow margin.
In this case, Trump is doing much, much worse than Biden. Biden hasn't a 10 plus point lead in these states and we should also compare this to 2016, where Clinton never had over 50 percent threshold in this states. We also see big lead for Biden in states like Florida, with six points, seven points in Arizona, and 10 points in North Carolina. And the poll also revealed other demographics that we're not looking good for Trump.
So, the only category where he is doing a little better, by 3 points, is in the age group of 45-year-olds to 64-year-olds. But in every other age group, he's losing by wide margins. We are seeing those that are over 65, it's a 17 point drop from where he was in 2016. We see that among white voters. This normally is his biggest support base, but we are seeing that his support is dwindling there too.
ALLEN: Right. So let's talk about what is going there was just a strong anybody but wrong for this president. Certainly, he has been widely criticized for his non handling of the pandemic which is now spiraling out of control and many states that coupled with the protests and of course prior to that, there was just a strong anybody but Trump movement. It seems like, since the protests, and this pandemic, has gotten worse and worse that he has gotten worse and worse in n these polls.
LINDSTAEDT: So, I think the pandemic wasn't helping matters and he certainly wasn't gaining any support due to the way he was handling the pandemic. In fact, a majority of the public did not think he was handling it well, and in the polls it revealed that in swing states, a strong majority didn't think that he was handling it well. But where the turning point was seems to be the protest. The way he handle the protest and the way that the public perceives his ability to handle race relations. He only has about 30 percent approval ratings in terms of how he deals with race and how he dealt with the protests. And we can see a big jump from May 25th, around the time that the protest started to take place, to now, a month later. And that Biden gained an average three points extra just in that one month.
Now, of course, anything can change, but the way he has managed this, whether it be using the military on his own protesters for the ridiculous photo-op he had with the bible, he is not being viewed as someone who can really unite the country.
ALLEN: Right. And again, and again, he now has a forum. He's doing his rallies to say something different. To come out with something that Americans can cling to that he is a leader that they can count on during a very tumultuous time. So, the question is, and you mentioned it, what can he do at this point to turn this around, because he is not seeming like he's putting in that effort?
[03:40:03]
LINDSTAEDT: Right, I mean, I think the number one thing he should do is focus on the economic argument for him. So, if you were to look at the -- some of the individuals that were polled, and they were asked if they are going to vote for Trump again and some of them said they might vote for Trump again, and in many cases, it was for economic reason.
For example, an owner of a small business said he would vote for Trump even though he wasn't that please with him, because he really believes in low taxes and that the government needs to stay out of regulating business. So, if I were the Trump campaign, I would be focusing on taxes. And that he would be the president to lower taxes and try to appeal to voters in that way, because the poll also reveal that it was really only the economy was the one thing that he had an approval rating above 50 percent.
ALLEN: Natasha Lindstaedt, we always appreciate your insights, thank you again.
LINDSTAEDT: Thanks for having me.
ALLEN: Now we are going to look at the coronavirus in another part of the world and in parts of the U.K. Meat factories are seeing a spike in cases. The (inaudible) meat factory in England, recorded 165 cases and in Wales more than 300 cases had been confirmed. And to separately meat and food processing plants. CNN's Anna Stewart is in Wales, outside of one of those plants for us. These are terrible numbers on Anna. What is being done about it?
ANNA STEWART, CNN PRODUCER: Yes, this is the poultry factory that had to declare 200 cases so far. It's a really worrying trend and it's across Europe and the United States. Seeing this large outbreaks in meat processing plants, and slaughterhouses. Experts are trying to work out exactly what is going on here. Why specifically these kinds of plants.
There are confluence of factors at play. First of all, of course, it's difficult to keep social distance in some of the production lines. Despite new measures being introduce, I know this one did have new covid-19 safety measures in place. Some are pointing to the poles and wet environment inside the factories that could help spread the virus.
It's also incredibly noisy I'm told, which means workers are often shouting to make each other heard. That means that droplets spread is an issue as well. And quite outside what goes inside -- I'm sorry, what goes on inside the factories, the working conditions, you also got to weigh the conditions outside of the factory? A high proportion of the workers in this sector here in the U.K., also across the Europe, also across the U.S., are migrants.
And they often work together but they also live together in communities around the factories. They travel together in uses. Some will work multiple meat processing plants in the country and travel together between them. So, there is a risk of spread not just inside the factories, but also an issue outside, Natalie.
ALLEN: Right. You have to feel for the people that are doing these jobs right now, in these conditions. So, what is the reaction been in the wider community, given the risk of outbreaks, like this spreading. Germany, I believe has forced a quarantine of some 360,000 people in the area around their major factory outbreak.
STEWART: This is really the big concern that you get an outbreak, within a factory and it spreads to a wider community. And this is happening as countries are starting to ease lockdown. Now here in Wales, lockdown is still very much in place. It hasn't been lifted like it has in England, so going into town is barely empty, not least as many of the workers that work, for instance in this factory are in quarantine as all the families and their contacts.
That was definitely a sense of apprehension though, people don't want to come into close contact with (inaudible) some locals tell me, they wouldn't go to the supermarkets or near this factory, because they were so concerned that the virus could spread around there. There is a big risk, in this is something that we are going to have to watch across Europe, across United States, these factories and the outbreaks around them and what that does to communities as lockdown are lifted. I can tell you there is a meat summit in Berlin today. That is as you said where the biggest outbreak has been in Europe. Ministers and representatives, I'm told are going to meet today to try and find ways to improve conditions for the workers in these factories. Natalie.
ALLEN: My goodness. All right. Anna Stewart, for us there. Thank you so much, Anna.
Some mixed news to report on another deadly virus, health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo say the world's second deadliest Ebola outbreak is over, but not before it killed 2,200 people. But there is another Ebola outbreak in Congo as coronavirus also hits the region. For more about, I'm joined by CNN's David McKenzie, he is live for us in Johannesburg. How bad does it look for this country David? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, certainly, I think everyone is desperate for some good news when it comes to the battle against spreading disease. And the DRC is certainly no stranger to that in recent years. Now, you know, we travel to the epicenter of this outbreak, this Ebola outbreak, in the northeast of the country last year, and I was really struck by the bravery of the health workers then. Subsequently that kind of storyline that is spread around the globe when it comes to covid-19. I think it's important to remember today that this battle has been won in this part of the Congo, and it was due to these brave health workers.
[03:45:12]
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MCKENZIE: When it seemed like the outbreak was becoming endless and the fear of the virus insurmountable. It was the frontline workers we met last year, doctors like Cameron (inaudible), who taught us what it means to fight.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sometimes, all the world knows its fear, but they don't look at the individual people.
MCKENZIE: We need to treat these patients with empathy, he said, we need to treat them like they are a member of our family. Volunteers like Maxima (ph) recovering from disease that carried 66 percent mortality rate, and then caring for children or parents sick in isolation.
You have a smile on your face? Why do you have a smile on your face?
My smile is the joy of being alive, I beat Ebola, she said.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You should be very proud to had been able to eliminated Ebola in such circumstance in (inaudible). And let's say, at the end of a long marathon, now, you don't have (inaudible) to fight against the covid-19.
MCKENZIE: The milestone has been reached, ending a deadly Ebola outbreak in the middle of a conflict zone. But the celebration will be brief, there is a new Ebola outbreak in the country's west and these health workers, who learned how to fight against Ebola, who overcame community mistrust and misinformation, even attacks against their clinics must now take on covid-19 with cases spreading from the capital.
What is your message for the world out there? What can be done?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's about solidarity.
MCKENZIE: It is also about perseverance. Here they know experimental vaccines are incredible weapons, but they are not magic bullets. Here without highways, even pave roads in most places, they know how crucial supplies become (inaudible), how early detection, contact tracing and isolation are drivers of the response. Here they know how to fight. And while these nurses are battling a new virus, on this day, they deserve their moment.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MCKENZIE: Well, Natalie, you know, the WHO, yesterday said that it is really important to learn the lessons that DRC learned in its fight against Ebola in the eastern part of the country. In particular the key they say to stop virus spreading, including covid-19, is also about community engagement, about trust, and about people really understanding the threat and how to mitigate it.
So, in a way though the Congo has so many difficult circumstances to deal with, they can teach the rest of the world on how to deal with a pandemic spread. Natalie?
ALLEN: Absolutely, thank you for that report. David McKenzie for us in Johannesburg. David, thanks.
Coming up here, a cold case heating up more than a decade later. We are learning more about the man who police suspect killed three year old Madeleine McCann.
[03:50:00]
ALLEN: It has been 13 years since Madeleine McCann disappeared, but German prosecutors are investigating him and the suspect who killed the little girl, back in 2007. Our Fred Pleitgen has the latest.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Praia da Luz, the Portuguese resort from where the then three year old Madeleine McCann vanished in 2007. Investigators believe the man they now think murdered, her. A 43-year-old German Christian B., lived in this house, less than a mile, away at the time.
German prosecutors are asking members of the public to come forward with any sort of tips they might have. They believe that even 13 years later, there might be people out there who could have valuable information about anything suspicious, not just that happened outside of this house, but that might had happen inside as well.
Authorities released this pictures, and are calling on anyone who may remember having been inside around the year 2007 to come forward. But as German prosecutors trace Christian B's movement, we get to the village Foral, around 30 miles to the east. It was out of this house that a friend of Christian B's was running an agency taking care of children from Germany at the time, the owner of the property tells CNN.
When one of the kids ran away, Christian B appeared, and camp outside the house, living in his distinctive camper van for more than two months, until he brought the child back according to the house's owner. Portuguese authorities are refusing to comment on the case. CNN has learned, the Volkswagen camper van about which the authorities are also seeking further information was found only a few miles away. Christian B later moved to Germany, where he ran a kiosk. One of the workers there recalls him getting tents, when the McCann investigation came up.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: At some point he just said, people need to stop, the child is long dead, and I asked, how would he know? The child might just have run away or been kidnapped. And he said, after so many years, he child must be dead. And a dead body can be hidden easily.
PLEITGEN: Prosecutors say Christian B. also bought this abandoned factory about 100 miles away, police conducted several searches here in the past years. As you can see, there is still a lot of stuffing around here, but the authorities say that it wasn't until they started digging on this property that they found several data carriers with lots of pornographic materials including child porn on them.
The local prosecutor also said that children's bathing suit were found on the premises. This as authorities say they believe Christian B maybe responsible for other crimes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We're pursuing two goals, one, is of course to solve the murder of Maddie McCann in such a way that we ultimately get a judgment by a court in which the accused is also convicted, however, it is at least as important to for us to find possible further victims of our accused in Portugal, and perhaps, elsewhere.
PLEITGEN: Currently jailed for another crime, Christian B's lawyer says his client is not talking to authorities, but that hasn't stop German prosecutors who continue to put together their case, hoping to finally solve the mystery of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Fred Pleitgen, CNN Praia de Luz, Portugal.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ALLEN: And I'll have more news right after this.
[03:55:00]
ALLEN: Take a look here at a party, three decades in the making. Liverpool fans, outside of their stadium, right here, celebrating becoming English football champions for the first time since 1990. And our Alex Thomas is live in Liverpool with the story for us, and we can imagine the celebrations went on for a very long time, well deserved.
ALEX THOMAS, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Rosemary, mixed feeling about those scenes of celebrations that you just saw, which were outside Anfield stadium. I'm inside right now, and this is where Liverpool played, although there is no action last night.
Mixed feelings about the celebrations because of course, that mass gathering with breaking all coronavirus regulations. The players were just as ecstatic as the fans, they gather to watch Chelsea play Manchester city, hundreds of miles away in west London and the result went Liverpool's way, meaning their champions again. Let's show you what happened in the game itself.
Christina (inaudible), the U.S. star, giving Chelsea the lead. Manchester City came back into the game, regaining the momentum with a goal from Kevin (inaudible) there, Dutch international, tremendous free kick. Chelsea didn't give up though, they won a penalty when (Inaudible) handheld the ball, he was sent off and Williams, for Chelsea at two-one victory for them, and it means that Liverpool's closest challenger Manchester City who lost that game, cannot now mathematically catch Liverpool at the top of the table.
There on course record points settle showing how dominant they had been and despite this more than three month break because of the coronavirus crisis, they managed to get the season back up and running. Liverpool champions, once more and it's all about those fans celebrations that we saw earlier, as the manager of Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp, acknowledged when speaking to the U.K. sky sports.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JURGEN KLOPP, LIVERPOOL MANAGER: It's for you out there. It's for you. It's incredible. I hope you stay at home, I hope you go in front of your house if you want, but do not more and celebrate it, it's all here. And it's all here. We can do it together in this moment, and it is a joy to do it for you, I can tell you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
THOMAS: Rosemary, it's very hard to put into words exactly how momentous this is. Winning the premier league is a big deal anyway, but this is much more than just a story of a famous football club winning a trophy that they haven't won for some time. 1990 was the last time they had been champions of English football, and not only are the European champions, they really wanted to win the league, once again.
If you think about grandparents, taking their grandkids to Liverpool, back in 1990, those grandparents probably were passed away since then. I spoke to a dad last night who brought his 6-year-old son to see the celebrations. The 6-year-old son was on his shoulders, the dad wasn't even alive the previous time Liverpool have been champions of England. This is a club that believed it is part of a city and the community as much as playing good football, and no wonder the celebrations were so wild and ecstatic. This is huge for these fans, and for this club, Rosemary.
ALLEN: All right. Wonderful story, thank you so much Alex Thomas, for us, in Liverpool. And thank you for watching this hour of CNN Newsroom, stay with me, I will be right back with another hour of news and our top stories."

Ma la lotta non è ancora finita»",FALSE,"La sera di martedì 6 ottobre 1998 Aaron McKinney e Russell Henderson incontrarono Matthew Shepard al Fireside Bar & Lounge di Laramie, Wyoming. Gli fecero credere di essere gay, come Matthew, per attirarlo in una trappola. Riuscirono a convincerlo a salire sul loro furgoncino e guidarono in una zona remota di quello che è conosciuto con il nome di Cowboy State, lo Stato dei cowboy. I tragici eventi che sarebbero accaduti di lì a poco, nelle prime ore del 7 ottobre 1998, hanno cambiato la storia recente degli Stati Uniti.
Il corpo di Matthew, 21 anni, venne trovato da un ciclista 18 ore dopo, legato a una staccionata. Era in stato di incoscienza. L'uomo non lo riconobbe subito, alla polizia e alla stampa disse che aveva scambiato quel corpo sfigurato per uno spaventapasseri. Dopo averlo legato, Aaron e Russell picchiarono brutalmente Matthew, all'epoca studente del primo anno di Relazioni internazionali e Lingue alla University of Wyoming di Laramie. Lo colpirono con il calcio della pistola e lo derisero mentre implorava per la sua vita. Lo torturarono perché era gay. Matthew era alto quasi un metro e sessanta e pesava 47 chili. Rimase attaccato a quella staccionata per una notte e un giorno, nel freddo autunnale.
Morì la notte del 12 ottobre, 53 minuti dopo la mezzanotte, al Poudre Valley Hospital di Fort Collins, Colorado, dove era stato trasferito nel disperato tentativo di salvargli la vita. Aaron McKinney e Russell Henderson, due giovani cresciuti nella povertà, prodotto del mondo della droga e dell'alcol, vennero condannati all'ergastolo con l'accusa di rapimento e di omicidio di primo grado. Dissero di non avere mai visto Matthew prima di quella sera al Fireside Bar & Lounge.
Poco dopo la morte del loro figlio maggiore, Judy e Dennis Shepard crearono la Matthew Shepard Foundation, con sede a Denver, Colorado. La fondazione, presieduta da Judy, svolge un ruolo di sensibilizzazione sociale e offre consulenze a famiglie e imprese; ha formato nel corso degli anni oltre mille ufficiali di polizia e quasi cento pubblici ministeri, affinché non si lascino guidare dai pregiudizi nell'adempimento del loro mestiere. Sostiene da sempre, tra le altre cose, il Laramie Project , spettacolo teatrale portato in scena dal Tectonic Theater Project di New York. «Io e Dennis abbiamo deciso di creare una fondazione in nome di nostro figlio Matthew poco dopo la sua morte», racconta a «la Lettura» Judy Shepard. «Eravamo al suo fianco, prima che morisse, e continuavamo a ricevere decine di messaggi e di chiamate da persone che esprimevano la loro vicinanza, che ci esortavano a fare sentire la nostra voce. L'omicidio di Matthew aveva scioccato la nazione. Sin da subito abbiamo avuto la sensazione che quella storia sarebbe rimasta come monito nella coscienza collettiva. Poco prima che nostro figlio se ne andasse per sempre, in quel letto di ospedale, io e mio marito abbiamo promesso a noi stessi che avremmo fatto il possibile per rendere le vite degli amici e dei coetanei di Matthew migliori, più sicure».
Il lavoro instancabile di Judy Shepard e della fondazione ha portato all'approvazione del Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, una legge promulgata da Barack Obama il 28 ottobre 2009, che considera crimini d'odio anche quelli motivati dall'orientamento sessuale. Un evento epocale nella storia americana.
Quel giorno Judy era alla Casa Bianca. «Dopo una battaglia durata dieci anni abbiamo ottenuto la nostra prima vittoria, una legge che proteggesse le comunità Lgbtqi+. È stato meraviglioso testimoniarlo in prima persona. In molti mi hanno detto: ""Hai ottenuto ciò che volevi, hai vinto"". Ho risposto che non era ancora finita, che c'era tanto, troppo, da fare, e che la battaglia della fondazione non si sarebbe fermata lì. Ancora oggi, in alcuni Stati, molte coppie gay hanno difficoltà ad adottare figli».
Il 28 ottobre 2009 a Washington c'erano anche Louvon Harris e Betty Byrd Boatner, le sorelle di James Byrd Jr., un afroamericano di 49 anni ucciso il 7 giugno 1998 a Jasper, Texas, da tre suprematisti bianchi. La legge firmata da Obama porta anche il suo nome.
La piccola Laramie è un puntino liberale nello Stato dei cowboy. Durante l'anno accademico metà della popolazione è composta da studenti. La città è attraversata da un conflitto sotterraneo tra l'anima rurale dei suoi abitanti e quella più aperta degli studenti. «I due assassini di Matt non rappresentano la vera Laramie - continua Judy -, la violenza non è la vera anima di questa cittadina. Negli anni Novanta l'intolleranza verso i gay era una questione nazionale, non locale. I gay non venivano odiati solo a Laramie ma ovunque in America. Laramie è una classica cittadina di provincia, a maggioranza bianca, lontana, geograficamente e culturalmente, dal resto del Paese. Ci sono persone che ancora non credono alla versione ufficiale dell'uccisione di Matthew. Ci sono persone che non hanno accettato la sentenza del processo. Dall'altro lato, ci sono membri della comunità che sono rimasti scioccati e che hanno provato a vederci più chiaro in questa storia».
Matthew aveva un fratello minore, più piccolo di quattro anni, e aveva frequentato il liceo a Lugano, in Svizzera. Nel ricordo della madre è un ragazzo che amava viaggiare, con uno spiccato senso critico, pronto ad ascoltare chiunque avesse bisogno. «A Matt piaceva esplorare il mondo, la vita in Wyoming non era all'altezza dei suoi sogni, qui si sentiva in trappola. Fumava troppo. Non sopportava gli abusi. Si schierava sempre dalla parte degli oppressi», racconta Judy.
Judy e Dennis vivono ancora a Casper, Wyoming, dove Matthew è nato il 1° dicembre 1976. Non si sono mai stancati di raccontare la sua storia, di come hanno vissuto gli ultimi vent'anni. Parlare di Matt, per Judy, significa rituffarsi nello stesso dolore. «Sono arrabbiata, ma non smetterò mai di combattere. Fino a quando ci saranno orecchie pronte ad ascoltarci, noi parleremo».

Ein weißes Zeltdach schützt die Speisen vor der warmen Septembersonne von Pennsylvania.
 »Pilates war großartig«, antwortet eine Frau, die wie Shelly Schwab um die sechzig ist und wie Shelly Schwab deutlich jünger aussieht. »I love your t-shirt, Shelly! Wo hast du das her?« 
 Shelly Schwab schaut an sich herab auf das enge schwarze Shirt. »Hat mir eine Freundin geschenkt. Die offiziellen T-Shirts der Wahlkampagne sind alle so groß, die sehen an mir aus wie ein Sack.« Sie zieht den Schriftzug glatt, damit er besser lesbar ist: Trump 2020. Shelly lacht, wendet sich dem nächsten Gast zu und hilft, den Picknickteller zu füllen. 
 Eine Dreiviertelstunde Autofahrt außerhalb von Philadelphia, auf der Wiese eines privaten Sportclubs, treffen sich an diesem Samstagmittag die »Frauen für Trump«. Viele haben ihre ganze Familie mitgebracht, kleine Mädchen in Sommerkleidchen laufen barfuß über den Rasen und spielen mit Luftballons, alte Männer machen es sich in mitgebrachten Strandstühlen bequem und reden. An einem der Picknicktische holt eine Frau ihre rote Make America Great Again -Kappe aus der Tasche. 
»Trägst du die in der Öffentlichkeit?«, fragt die Sitznachbarin.
Die Frau schüttelt den Kopf. »Ich will nicht von den Linken angegriffen werden.«
 Als Reporterin nähert man sich einem Treffen von Trump-Anhängern eher vorsichtig. Für sie sind Journalisten Lügner, Teil der linksliberalen Elite, gegen die Donald Trump darum kämpft, Amerika great again zu machen. Auch ich bin auf seinen Wahlveranstaltungen schon angefeindet worden. Deshalb überrascht und erleichtert es mich, wie freundlich ich hier im Vorort von den Trump-Frauen und ihren Familien begrüßt werde. Manche von ihnen umarmen mich gleich. Das ist mir dann schon wieder zu viel des Guten. Denn außer mir trägt niemand eine Maske. 
Als ich die Pandemie anspreche, fallen an dem Tisch, an dem ich sitze, »Keine Panik«-Sätze. Ist doch alles übertrieben. Hat in dieser Gegend kaum jemand. Masken sind höchstens etwas für dicht besiedelte Großstädte. Dass Donald Trump drei Wochen später selbst erkranken wird, scheint den Frauen an diesem idyllischen Picknick-Samstag unvorstellbar. Das Coronavirus ist für sie kein großes Thema.
Ihr großes Thema sind die Linken.
»Die Professoren manipulieren unsere Kinder«, heißt es am Picknicktisch
»Ich bin so froh, Gleichgesinnte zu treffen. Princeton ist so schrecklich liberal«, sagt eine Frau Mitte sechzig, die aus dem nahen Uni-Städtchen angereist ist und dort von den Einkünften aus ihrem Immobilienbesitz lebt, wie sie erzählt.
Eine andere: »Die Professoren dort manipulieren unsere Kinder. Meine Tochter sagte mir kürzlich, ich müsse mir meiner Privilegien als weiße Frau bewusst werden!«
Eine ehemalige Sekretärin, Mitte siebzig: »Obama durften wir nicht kritisieren, nur weil der Hurensohn schwarz war. Aber die Demokraten dürfen Trump jeden Schimpfnamen verpassen.«
Die Immobilienbesitzerin aus Princeton: »Wir sind die schweigende Mehrheit.«
Dann stehen die Frauen auf, um sich etwas zu essen zu holen, und auf die freien Plätze an meinem Tisch setzt sich Julia mit ihren beiden Söhnen, 13 und 19 Jahre alt. Ihre drei älteren Töchter, erzählt sie, sind schon aus dem Haus. Julia Snyder ist 59, trägt schwarze Leggins und will ihren echten Namen nicht veröffentlicht sehen. Sie hat mal in New York als Investmentbankerin gearbeitet. Vor knapp 30 Jahren gab sie ihren Job auf und zog mit ihrem Mann nach Yardley, einem der ältesten und wohlhabendsten Vororte von Philadelphia - in eine Welt der stattlichen Einfamilienhäuser, jedes umgeben von einem großen, gepflegten Rasengrundstück. Julia sagt, sie liebe die Weite und die unbebaute Landschaft um Yardley herum. Alte Bäume, wogende Maisfelder. Farmen, auf denen man im Sommer mit der Familie Beeren pflücken kann und im Winter Kürbisse kaufen. Es gibt einen idyllischen Bauernmarkt, und die freiwillige Feuerwehr wurde vor einigen Jahren zur besten im ganzen Regierungsbezirk gewählt. Kann man sich einen schöneren Ort vorstellen, um fünf Kinder großzuziehen?
Sie komme aus einem Elternhaus, in dem man immer für die Demokraten war, sagt Julia Snyder. Als junge Frau sei sie dann von Ronald Reagan begeistert gewesen. »Ihn habe ich gewählt, als ich zum ersten Mal meine Stimme abgeben durfte. Seitdem wähle ich die Republikaner. Und diesmal wieder Trump. Das steht fest.«
Auf das Picknick stieß ich, als ich mich auf die Suche nach den »Vorstadtfrauen« machte, über die in den vergangenen Monaten viel berichtet wurde, wenn vom Kampf zwischen Donald Trump und Joe Biden um das Weiße Haus die Rede war. Trump und Biden sind sich bekanntlich über kaum etwas einig. Wenn es aber darum geht, welche Wählergruppe bei dieser Wahl eine entscheidende Rolle spielt, dann dürften die beiden doch einer Meinung sein. Es sind nicht die schwarzen Großstädter oder die Latinos in den Südstaaten. Auf die weißen Frauen aus den Suburbs kommt es an.
Die amerikanischen Vororte sind so etwas wie eine Transitzone. Sie sind weder Großstadt noch Provinz, weder gebildet-liberal noch konservativ-ländlich, genauer gesagt: Sie sind beides. Hier scheinen die Menschen nicht so festgelegt auf eine politische Identität zu sein wie im Rest des Landes, hier leben besonders viele Wechselwähler, die sich mal für die eine, mal für die andere Seite entscheiden.
Es gibt das Bild des typischen Trump-Wählers, an dem Soziologen, Journalisten und ratlose Vertreter der alten politischen Eliten seit Jahren zeichnen. Dieses Bild zeigt einen wütenden Mann. Er ist arm und lebt in einer Gegend, mit der es seit Langem bergab geht, vielleicht hat der Mann selbst seinen Job verloren. Er ist so laut und aggressiv, weil er nicht mehr gebraucht wird. Dafür macht er das Establishment verantwortlich.
Das Bild ist nicht falsch. Aber es zeigt nur einen Ausschnitt der Wirklichkeit.
Schöne Häuser, große Autos, viel Grün. Woher kommt das Gefühl der Bedrohung?
Die materiell abgesicherten, gut ausgebildeten weißen Frauen aus den prosperierenden Vororten - es scheint, als hätten sie mit dem wütenden Mann kaum etwas gemein, nur die Hautfarbe. Und doch hat bei der Wahl 2016 fast jede zweite von ihnen für Donald Trump gestimmt. Was er dann allerdings mit dem Amt anstellte, zu dem sie ihm verholfen hatten, hat nicht mehr allen diesen Frauen gefallen. Da waren die plumpen Komplimente, die Trump der Ehefrau seines Amtskollegen aus Frankreich machte. Da waren die sexistischen Kommentare über Journalistinnen, die es wagten, ihn zu kritisieren. Da war sein ganzes breitbeiniges männliches Auftreten, das sie täglich im Fernsehen vorgeführt bekamen, zuletzt vergangene Woche im TV-Duell mit Joe Biden. Trump war ihnen peinlich.
Schaut man sich heute die Umfragen an, dann ist das Verhältnis zwischen Trump-Anhängern und Biden-Anhängern in den amerikanischen Suburbs bei den Männern noch einigermaßen ausgeglichen. Anders bei den Frauen. Von ihnen sagt inzwischen eine große Mehrheit: Ich werde Biden wählen. Viele haben die Seiten gewechselt. Trump kann Stimme um Stimme von den wütenden männlichen Verlierern einsammeln, das allein wird ihm nicht helfen. Er braucht Erfolge in den Vororten. Er braucht Frauen wie Julia.
Irgendetwas an Trump und den Republikanern muss es geben, das diese Frauen zumindest empfänglich macht für ihre Botschaften. Was genau?
Je länger ich mich mit Julia am Picknicktisch unterhalte, desto mehr fällt mir auf, wie sehr sie von Werten redet, die man klassisch bürgerlich nennen könnte. Bildung. Leistung. Geradlinigkeit. Sie sagt, sie habe damals ganz bewusst ihren Job aufgegeben. Sie wollte für ihre Kinder da sein, wollte ihnen diese Werte vorleben. Ihr Mann, der politisch ähnlich denkt wie sie, verdiente als Chemiker bei einem Pharmakonzern genug. »Wie Frauen Beruf und Familie vereinbaren können, ist mir ein Rätsel.« Und Julia ist nicht enttäuscht worden, sie hat viele ihrer Ziele erreicht. Alle fünf Kinder sind gläubig erzogen, sie haben diverse Auszeichnungen in der Schule erhalten, jedes spricht mindestens eine Fremdsprache und spielt ein Streichinstrument. Dazu noch Klavier.
Julia braucht sich um die Zukunft ihrer Kinder keine Sorgen zu machen, könnte man meinen. Der Vorort hat sie auf die Welt da draußen ziemlich gut vorbereitet. Deshalb verwundert es mich, als Julia sagt, sie habe Angst davor, wie es ihren beiden Jungs im Leben ergehen werde. »Als christliche weiße Männer haben sie in unserer Welt doch eine Zielscheibe auf dem Rücken.«
 Wo ich eine erfolgreiche Frau sehe, die Anlass hätte zur Gelassenheit, scheint sie selbst nur Gefahren zu sehen, für ihren Lebensstil, ihre Kinder, all ihre Gewissheiten. Es fing damit an, dass die Arbeit ihres Mannes nach Indien outgesourct wurde. Er fand einen neuen Job, sagt Julia, aber bei einer weniger renommierten Firma. War das der Segen der von den liberalen Eliten gepriesenen Globalisierung? Warum, fragt Julia, nannten die Lehrer ihrer Kinder im Unterricht plötzlich Gründe, weshalb man nicht mehr stolz sein dürfe auf die USA? Warum hängten sie Plakate auf mit der Aufschrift No place for hate? »Was soll das? Amerika ist kein Ort des Hasses!« 
 Ich kann sie ein Stück weit verstehen. Auch ich erlebe, wie bereitwillig sich öffentliche Institutionen oder auch Unternehmen und Hollywoodstars in den USA linke Anliegen zu eigen machen. Neulich schrieb die Direktorin der Schule meiner Tochter in New York eine E-Mail an die Eltern. Unter ihren Namen setzte sie die weiblichen Pronomen she / her . Sie wollte demonstrieren, dass ihre Weiblichkeit nicht selbstverständlich ist. Dass jeder Mensch sein Geschlecht wählen dürfen soll. In vielen Firmen und öffentlichen Einrichtungen wird das mittlerweile von den Mitarbeitern gewünscht, wenn sie E-Mails verschicken. 
 Ich habe mich darüber gewundert, aber es war mir letztlich egal. Geärgert habe ich mich, als die liberale New York Times den Chef ihrer Meinungsseite entließ, weil er den Beitrag eines konservativen Senators abgedruckt hatte. Junge progressive Redakteure hatten Druck auf die Chefredaktion ausgeübt. Wer sich in der liberalen amerikanischen Sphäre heute öffentlich äußert, muss sich ständig gegen Rechts abgrenzen. Wo eine Gesellschaft miteinander debattieren sollte, gibt es kaum noch Spielraum für Gedanken und Beobachtungen, die nicht ins Raster passen. 
Ich kenne noch andere Amerikaner, die wie Julia Donald Trump bewundern - und die mitunter sehr gebildete, zugängliche, auf den ersten Blick sympathische Leute sind. Je länger unsere Unterhaltung dauert, desto mehr spricht Julia dann allerdings mit einer fast verzweifelten Dringlichkeit. Beugt sich zu mir herüber, warnt wie eine Dissidentin: »Wir müssen vorsichtig sein! Die Leute in der Schulbehörde mögen es nicht, wenn man so etwas erwähnt.« Und: »Dahinter stecken mächtige Interessen.«
Es ist, als ziehe diese so freundliche Frau plötzlich von innen alle Vorhänge zu. Und im abgedunkelten Raum macht für sie alles Sinn. Die Herrschaft der sogenannten Globalisten, die Amerika in den Kommunismus treiben wollen. George Soros. Barack Obama. Black Lives Matter. »Hollywood ist auch voller Kommunisten«, sagt Julia und ergänzt fast erschöpft: »Trump ist unsere einzige Rettung.«
»Mama? Können wir jetzt endlich nach Hause?«, fragt ihr 19-Jähriger. Vorhang aufgezogen. Plötzlich ist es wieder hell.
Das Abgleiten in Verschwörungstheorien und die Verehrung Donald Trumps als nationaler Erlöser sind mir nicht unbekannt. Dafür war ich zu oft auf Trumps Massenveranstaltungen, er hat sie ja bis kurz vor seiner Erkrankung abgehalten, auch hier im Bundesstaat Pennsylvania. Da sieht man sie, die Männer vom Land, die sich aufpeitschen lassen. Legt sich die Apokalypse-Tonspur aber über das friedliche Bild einer Mutter mit ihren Kindern an einem Picknicktisch, mitten in einem bürgerlichen Vorort voller Grün, dann ist das ziemlich irritierend. Ich kann mich mit Julia wunderbar unterhalten. Und ich kann mich mit ihr nicht verständigen, denn sie nutzt anders als ich keine klassischen Medien. Ihr Gut-gegen-Böse-Weltbild hat sie aus dem Paralleluniversum rechter Websites und Podcasts. Dort findet sie eine Sprache für das Gefühl der Bedrohung.
Vor ein paar Tagen habe ich Julia angerufen. Ich wollte wissen, wie sie darauf reagiert, dass ihr Held in einem Krankenhaus gegen Covid-19 kämpfen musste. Julia klang nicht sehr besorgt. Für sie hat die Pandemie wenig mit Medizin zu tun und viel mit Politik. In den Warnungen der Demokraten vor dem Virus sieht sie den Versuch, das Freiheitsrecht des amerikanischen Volkes zu beschränken. »Trump ist stark, ein bisschen wie ein Übermensch.« Er werde die Krankheit schnell überstehen und dadurch beweisen, dass sie nicht so schlimm ist. Ein weiterer Sieg des Guten über das Böse.
Donald Trump hat Pennsylvania 2016 mit lediglich 44.000 Stimmen Vorsprung gewonnen. Wer Präsident werden will, der muss hier auch dieses Mal wieder die Mehrheit der Stimmen holen - an Pennsylvania führt nach Ansicht der meisten Experten so gut wie kein Weg vorbei. Die Frau, die daran mitgewirkt hat, dass Trumps Chancen diesmal nicht mehr so gut stehen, heißt Lisa.
Ich bin mit ihr in einem Starbucks-Café verabredet, in demselben kleinen Einkaufszentrum, auf dessen Rückseite der Sportclub liegt, wo sich die »Frauen für Trump« zum Picknick trafen. Lisa und ihr Mann wohnen nicht weit von hier in einem Reihenhaus. Sie ist 56 und Informatikerin, sie trägt eine Maske mit einem Herzen darauf und erzählt von ihrem Kampf um die Seele des Vororts, so nüchtern wie eine Forscherin von einem Experiment.
 »Da ist schon wieder einer!« Lisa zeigt streng auf einen Truck, der an der Starbucks-Terrasse vorbeifährt. Auf der Ladefläche sind zwei riesige Trump 2020 -Flaggen montiert. Ihr eigenes Auto, vor uns auf dem Parkplatz, ist vollgestopft mit BIDEN-Schildern für die Vorgärten. Die hat sie selbst herstellen lassen, in der Druckerei einer Gewerkschaft. Die Biden-Wahlkampagne hat nämlich hier im Landkreis Bucks County, zu dem Yardley und weitere Vororte gehören, noch kein eigenes Hauptquartier. »Alles läuft virtuell, wegen Covid. Ganz schön nervig.« Die Gegenseite, sagt Lisa, nimmt keine Rücksicht auf die Pandemie und schickt ihre Leute los, um Schilder, Plakate und Flaggen zu verteilen. Wer jetzt in den Vororten unterwegs ist, liest überall TRUMP und fast nirgendwo BIDEN. Das muss sich dringend ändern, findet Lisa. Nicht dass es noch ein zweites 2016 gibt. 
Lisa heißt zwar wirklich Lisa, aber auch sie will nicht, dass ihr Nachname in der Zeitung erwähnt wird und dass man dort ihr Gesicht sehen kann. Ihr Mann ist überzeugter Trump-Fan, was aber kaum jemand weiß, und sie haben eine kleine Firma - der wolle sie keine Probleme bereiten, sagt sie. Firmen im Besitz von Trump-Anhängern werden in dieser Gegend schon mal boykottiert. Es ist manchmal kompliziert mit dem Freund-Feind-Denken.
Lisas Kontaktanzeige im Netz: Einsame Demokratin sucht andere Demokraten
Angefangen habe alles in der Wahlnacht vor vier Jahren, sagt Lisa. Sie saß damals in ihrem Wohnzimmer vor dem Fernseher, allein. Ihr Mann war durchaus zu Hause, nur schaute er die Wahlen auf dem Fernseher im Schlafzimmer. In den Monaten davor hatte sich zwischen ihnen das Schweigen ausgebreitet. Wie der Mann, den sie seit College-Zeiten kennt, mit dem sie zwei Kinder bekam, wie dieser fürsorgliche Mensch plötzlich einen Hass auf die Kandidatin Hillary Clinton entwickeln und in ihr nichts als ein »elitäres Biest« sehen konnte, das ging Lisa nicht in den Kopf. Er war immer ein moderater Republikaner gewesen, und Politik hatte zwischen den beiden nie für Probleme gesorgt. Nun, in den Wochen vor den Wahlen 2016, geschah es einmal sogar, dass sie ins Wohnzimmer kam und dort ihren Mann sitzen sah, hinter ihm der Fernseher, der das Standbild einer Trump-Kundgebung zeigte.
»Kriegt er euch so rum? Mit TV-Osmose?«, fragte sie ihn gereizt. Dabei hatte ihr Mann nur auf Pause gedrückt, um keinen Streit über Trump zu provozieren. Nein, sie beide in der Wahlnacht vor dem Fernseher, das wäre nicht gut gegangen, sagt Lisa heute.
Damals schaute sie also ganz allein zu, wie ihr Heimatstaat auf den Grafiken von CNN rot wurde. Sieg für Trump. Zuerst war sie einfach nur enttäuscht. Dann griff sie zu ihrem Computer und stellte eine Art Kontaktanzeige ins Internet: Einsame Demokratin sucht andere Demokraten zum Reden. 70 Verzweifelte meldeten sich. Fast nur Frauen.
In den Tagen danach reckten in den Vororten von Philadelphia immer mehr Trump-Gegner ihre Köpfe, wie Spargelspitzen, die an die Luft müssen. Bald gab es unzählige Gruppen, alle wollten mithelfen, die Demokratische Partei in den Suburbs zu erneuern. Die Parteifunktionäre hatten es im Wahlkampf versäumt, die Bewohner anzusprechen. Trump wählt hier sowieso niemand, hatten sie selbstzufrieden gedacht.
Die lokalen Gruppen schlossen sich zu einer Organisation zusammen. In den folgenden Jahren suchten Lisa und die anderen Frauen für die Demokraten Kandidaten für Lokalwahlen aus, telefonierten Wähler ab, liefen von Tür zu Tür, veranstalteten Fragerunden. Bei den Kongresswahlen 2018 zahlte sich ihr Einsatz aus: Dank der Stimmen aus den Vororten eroberten die Demokraten das Repräsentantenhaus in Washington. Sie gewannen Posten in lokalen Schulbehörden, die in den USA durch Wahlen bestimmt werden, nahmen den Republikanern Plätze im Parlament des Bundesstaates weg. Und stellen seit Januar 2020 zum ersten Mal in fast 40 Jahren die Mehrheit der Lokalregierung von Bucks County.
In ihrer Fassungslosigkeit darüber, dass dieser Mann Präsident werden konnte, hatte Lisa mitgeholfen, den Republikanern die Kontrolle über den Vorort zu entreißen. Sie hatte Julia Snyder und die anderen »Frauen für Trump« in Vertreter einer politischen Minderheit verwandelt.
Lisa und Julia kennen einander nicht. Sie leben beide an demselben Ort, aber ihre Antworten auf die Frage, was diesen Ort bedroht, könnten unterschiedlicher nicht sein. Setze ich mich ins Auto und fahre die ruhigen Vorstadtstraßen von Bucks County ab, dann fallen mir in der Tat Unterschiede auf. Manche Häuser sind sehr breit, andere nicht ganz so breit. Manche haben eine stattliche Auffahrt, andere stehen dichter am Nachbarhaus. Manche sind aus Stein gebaut, andere aus Holz.
Aber ich finde, allzu groß sind die Unterschiede nicht. Es sind ja fast alles Einfamilienhäuser mit Garten. Der Rasen ist meist sehr kurz, jedes Haus ist gepflegt und kündet von Wohlstand. Fast nirgendwo sieht man Zäune. Fast überall sieht man Grills. Könnten diese Häuser sprechen, müsste sich das, was sie zu sagen hätten, ziemlich ähnlich anhören.
Trump hat ein Label für die Vorortfrauen: Er nennt sie »suburban housewives«
Vor etwa 70 Jahren hatten zwei Brüder eine geniale Idee. Die Brüder hießen William und Alfred Levitt und stammten aus Brooklyn. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs hatte die Baufirma ihres Vaters für die U. S. Army schnell und effizient 2350 Militärbaracken errichtet. Egal, wo sie gebraucht wurden, die Unterkünfte schienen immer schon da zu sein. Nun war der Krieg vorbei, und in New York, Philadelphia und anderen Großstädten herrschte Wohnungsnot. Einwanderer aus Europa. Afroamerikaner aus dem Süden der USA. Kriegsheimkehrer mit dem Traum, endlich eine Familie zu gründen. Sie alle brauchten jetzt ein neues Zuhause. Bald waren die großen Städte überfüllt. Gewalt, Kriminalität und Drogenmissbrauch stiegen an.
Was gut für die U. S. Army ist, kann nicht falsch sein für alle Amerikaner, dachten sich Alfred und William Levitt. Zuerst nahe New York, dann bei Philadelphia errichteten sie auf billigem Farmland die beiden ersten modernen Vororte Amerikas: die Levittowns. Das Levittown von Bucks County, nur ein paar Kilometer von Julias und Lisas Häusern entfernt, zählt bis heute zu den größten von einer Hand geplanten Siedlungen der USA.
Die Käufer konnten sich zwischen sechs Varianten entscheiden. Da war das kalifornisch inspirierte Modell Levittowner für 10.990 Dollar. Der Country Clubber, doppelt so groß: 18.990 Dollar. Der Jubilee, mit Garage: 11.600 Dollar. Der Pennsylvanian: 14.500 Dollar. Der Colonial: 14.990 Dollar. Der doppelstöckige Rancher für die kinderreiche Familie: 8990 Dollar. 17.311 Häuser, von 1952 bis 1958 in Massenproduktion gefertigt, ähnlich wie die Autos, die all die Menschen kauften, die nun aus den Innenstädten herauszogen.
In den 1950ern und 1960ern fanden 20 Millionen Amerikaner in den beiden Levittowns und ihren unzähligen Nachfolgern eine neue Heimat. Sie flohen zunächst vor der Armut und der Kriminalität, später flohen sie auch vor den Rassenunruhen, den immer neuen Wellen an Einwanderern, dem ganzen chaotischen Leben in einer zunehmend liberalen Gesellschaft. Es war die größte Bevölkerungswanderung, die Amerika je erlebt hat.
Man könnte denken, die Häuser von Levittown hätten jedem offengestanden, der sich den Kauf leisten konnte. So war es bei den Autos ja auch. Allerdings ist die Frage, wer wo lebt, viel politischer als die Frage, wer welches Auto besitzt. Schwarzen, selbst denen mit gutem Job und sicherem Einkommen, blieb der Weg in die Vororte fast immer versperrt. Sie bekamen von den Banken einfach keinen halbwegs bezahlbaren Kredit. In Levittown war sogar der Weiterverkauf eines Hauses an Schwarze verboten, dazu musste sich jeder neue Besitzer per Unterschrift verpflichten. So kam es, dass die Mehrheit der Afroamerikaner als Mieter in den Städten blieb. Die Weißen wurden Hausbesitzer und legten den Grundstein für ihren Wohlstand.
Auch in Deutschland ziehen Menschen in Vororte. Aber ein deutscher Vorort ist etwas anderes als ein amerikanischer Suburb. Im Vorort kauft man sich ein Haus, weil man ins Grüne will, weil man sich mehr Platz und einen Garten wünscht und sich all dies vielleicht in der Stadt nicht leisten kann. Wer sich aber in den USA für ein Leben im Suburb entscheidet, der entscheidet sich für einen Ort, der geschaffen wurde, um ein vergangenes Amerika zu bewahren. Das Versprechen der Suburbs ist, historisch gesehen, das Versprechen vom Sieg des Konformismus über den sozialen Unterschied.
Deshalb standen Bewohnerinnen von Levittown, Bucks County, im Jahr 1957 in Caprihosen und mit Lockenfrisur vor einem der Tausenden gleichförmigen Häuser und protestierten gegen den Einzug von Daisy und William Myers und ihren drei Kindern. Familie Myers war die erste schwarze Familie in Levittown, Bürgerrechtler hatten den Kauf des Hauses über Umwege arrangiert. Die weißen Nachbarn - und Nachbarinnen - schmissen Steine durch die Fenster ins Innere des Hauses und warfen Zigarettenstummel auf das Grundstück. Einmal brannte ein zweieinhalb Meter großes Kreuz im Vorgarten. Familie Myers hielt es vier Jahre lang in Levittown aus.
Deshalb beklagt sich die Trump-Anhängerin Julia im Jahr 2020 bei mir darüber, was die Demokraten aus dem idyllischen Bucks County machen, jetzt, wo sie es wegen ihrer lokalpolitischen Erfolge durchsetzen können: Überall werde gebaut. Statt schöner frei stehender Häuser mit Garten werden jetzt tatsächlich auch platzsparende Reihenhäuser zugelassen. »Das ist wie in der Stadt«, sagt Julia. Die Reihenhäuser sind nur der Anfang, glaubt sie. »Irgendwann kommen die Sozialwohnungen und damit die Probleme.« Sie meint: Irgendwann kommen die Armen, in der Regel Afroamerikaner. Die Hochhäuser. Die Drogen. Die Kriminalität.
Und deshalb geht es im Wahlkampf der Republikaner ständig um die Gefahren, vor denen die Suburbs beschützt werden müssen. Nach den Protesten gegen Polizeigewalt in amerikanischen Städten sieht Trump jetzt die Chance, seinen Rückstand bei den Vorortfrauen aufzuholen, indem er das alte Versprechen erneuert.
Donald Trump auf Twitter an die Bewohnerinnen der Suburbs, 23. Juli 2020: »Biden wird eure Viertel zerstören und euren Amerikanischen Traum. Ich werde ihn bewahren - und ihn sogar besser machen!«
Nominierungsparteitag der Republikaner, 24. August: Das Video eines Ehepaars aus einem Vorort von St. Louis wird eingespielt. Die Demokraten, sagen die beiden, »wollen die Suburbs abschaffen. Sie wollen Verbrechen und Gesetzlosigkeit in blühende Nachbarschaften bringen.«
Kundgebung in Michigan, 10. September: Trump spielt eine Art Sketch zwischen einer imaginären Ehefrau und ihrem Mann. Der Mann: »Schatz, weißt du, wer nebenan eingezogen ist?« - Die Frau: »Oh, es ist einer von Antifa? Lass uns um Himmels willen von hier wegziehen. Lass uns unseren Vorort verlassen. Ich wünschte, Donald Trump wäre Präsident. Er hätte das nicht zugelassen.«
Die Botschaft liefert Trump seinem Publikum gleich mit: »Die Suburbs sind der Amerikanische Traum, das sage ich euch, ich habe eure Suburbs beschützt!«
 Trump hat sogar ein eigenes Label für die Vorortfrauen. Bei früheren Wahlen hießen sie soccer moms, später dann security moms. Trump nennt sie suburban housewives. Es ist ein Label, das weit in die Vergangenheit weist, in eine Zeit, als es in Bucks County wirklich nur Hausfrauen gab. Lauter Julias, die sich vor der Welt da draußen fürchteten. 
In einem sonnigen Park inmitten von Levittown sitzen drei Frauen aus drei Generationen: Barbara Bill, ihre Tochter Cindy Murphy und ihre Enkeltochter Dana Paglario. In der Nähe rollen gerade ein paar Frauen ihre Yogamatten ein, weiter hinten auf der grünen Wiese trainieren Mädchen, ja, was wohl? Soccer. Yoga und Frauenfußball - beides gab es hier noch nicht, als Barbara 1969 in ein Haus in der Nähe zog. Sie ist 82 und trägt farblich genau abgestimmten Schmuck, auf ihrem Kopf sitzt wie eine Krone eines dieser Rundum-Plastikvisiere gegen das Virus. »Beim Highschool-Abschluss war ich Jahrgangsbeste«, erzählt sie kokett. Sie arbeitete kurz als Sekretärin, dann kamen die Kinder, und Barbara wurde eine Vorort-Hausfrau. Die Demokraten hat sie trotzdem immer gewählt.
Barbara ruckelt an ihrem Visier. »Mama, mach dir keine Sorgen um deine Frisur, du siehst klasse aus!« Cindy, 56, hat die raue, selbstbewusste Stimme einer Kirmeschefin. Sie wohnt bei ihrer Mutter um die Ecke. Ihre beiden Brüder gingen nicht auf die Uni, Cindy aber wagte den Schritt nach der Scheidung von ihrem ersten Mann. Zehn Jahre brauchte sie neben Job und Kindern für den College-Abschluss, sie war der Erste in der Familie, dem das gelang. Heute arbeitet sie bei einer Bank und sitzt für die Demokraten im Stadtrat. »Als Dana mal mit einem Schwarzen zusammen war, brachte einer unserer Verwandten einen dummen Spruch. Dem hab ich gesagt: Hör auf mit der Scheiße!«
Dana, 24, nickt und trägt etwas Lipgloss auf. Was nicht ganz einfach ist, denn sie hat enorme Fingernägel. Auch Dana hat studiert, sie arbeitet als Grundschullehrerin. Seit der Trennung von ihrem letzten Freund lebt sie wieder im Haus ihrer Mutter hier in Levittown.
Es macht Freude, Cindy, Barbara und Dana dabei zuzuhören, wie sie aus ihrem Leben erzählen. Sie besitzen diese angenehme Selbstsicherheit, die man braucht, um über sich selbst zu lachen. Mir fällt auf, wie viel stabiler sie im Vergleich zu Julia wirken. Sie spielen zwar keine Streichinstrumente, und Cindys zweiter Mann ist kein hoch spezialisierter Chemiker, sondern Lastwagenfahrer. Ihr Vorortleben ist bescheidener als das von Julia. Dennoch wirken die drei auf mich irgendwie verwurzelter.
Die amerikanischen Suburbs sind nicht mehr die Orte, die sie einmal waren, und das liegt vor allem an den Frauen. Es waren Frauen, die seit den 1970ern massenhaft die Vororte verließen, um zu studieren und zu arbeiten. Es waren oft Frauen, die sich nicht vorschreiben lassen wollten, welchen amerikanischen Traum sie träumen sollen. Sie öffneten sich für die Welt, und mit ihnen die Suburbs. In Bucks County ist der Anteil der Schwarzen an der Bevölkerung immer noch zwei Drittel niedriger als im Landesdurchschnitt. Aber viele gut ausgebildete Einwanderer aus Asien sind hergezogen. Und junge Familien aus dem liberalen New York, denen es dort zu teuer geworden ist.
Das Klima wird rauer, auch in den Suburbs. Sie sind keine Welt für sich mehr
Kaum jemand hat vom Wandel der amerikanischen Gesellschaft mehr profitiert als Frauen wie Cindy, Barbara und Dana. Die amerikanischen Arbeiter hat die Globalisierung ärmer gemacht. Die Gottgläubigen hat der Liberalismus ins kulturelle Abseits gedrängt. Die Vorortfrauen dagegen sind immer unabhängiger, haben ein immer höheres Einkommen - und bemühen sich immer öfter darum, die Grenzen zwischen Suburb und Stadt einzureißen.
Vor Corona, erzählt Dana, sei sie jeden Tag in die Stadt gependelt, ihre Grundschule liegt in einem der sozial schwächsten Viertel von Philadelphia. Fast alle Kinder dort sind schwarz, Dana ist eine der wenigen weißen Lehrerinnen. Als ich sie bitte, ihre Arbeit zu beschreiben, wird sie vorsichtig, ringt um die richtigen Worte. »Das Unterrichten ist hart ... weißt du, was ich meine? Mir ist so ein Unterschied aufgefallen ... zwischen der Mitarbeit .... also dem Engagement der Kinder .... in der Stadt und ... na ja, im Suburb. Die Kinder ... Das sind die süßesten Kinder, aber ... es ist einfach ... ich glaube ... ihr Umfeld ist härter.«
Dana weiß, sie kämpft gegen die Folgen der großen Flucht der Weißen vor den Schwarzen, die vor 70 Jahren hier begann, in Levittown. Sie will weder den schwarzen Kindern noch deren Eltern die Schuld geben für die schlechten Schulleistungen. Für all die Probleme zu Hause. Das mangelnde Engagement der Mütter, die Abwesenheit der Väter. Das tut ja schon Donald Trump.
Aber die Sorgen, mit denen Trump da spielt, sind weit verbreitet, viel weiter, als man vermuten könnte. Sie beschäftigen auch Vorortfrauen, die ihn nicht wählen. Auch sie fühlen sich verantwortlich für das Wohl ihrer Familie, machen sich Gedanken um die Sicherheit ihrer Söhne und Töchter. Wie wäre das, wenn mehr Kinder aus sozial schwachen Familien bei uns im Suburb auf die Schule gingen? Würden meine Kinder dann weniger lernen? Hätten sie einen schlechteren Start ins Leben? Ist nicht vielleicht doch was dran an den Warnungen vor Chaos und Gewalt, die unsere Idylle unter Bäumen bedrohen?
Von Trump erwarten sich Dana, Cindy und Barbara allerdings keine Lösung des Problems. Im Gegenteil.
In New Hope, einem anderen wohlhabenden Vorort von Philadelphia, entdeckte neulich ein Gast in »Fred's Frühstücks-Café« ein rassistisches Poster. Es machte sich über Sozialhilfeempfänger lustig: »Heute Morgen wollte ich meine Hunde für Sozialhilfe anmelden. Zuerst sagt die Lady im Amt, Hunde bekommen keine Sozialhilfe. Dann erklärte ich ihr, dass meine Hunde gemischtrassig sind, arbeitslos, kein Englisch sprechen und keine Ahnung haben, wer ihre Väter sind ... Am Freitag erhalten sie ihre erste Zahlung.« Der Besitzer entschuldigte sich: War nicht so gemeint. War ja nur ein Witz.
 Ende Juli postete ein Junge aus Bucks County im Internet Drohungen gegen eine 16-jährige schwarze Mitschülerin. Sie erzeuge bei ihm den Wunsch, ein Hassdelikt gegen sie zu begehen. In einem zweiten Post sprang ein anderer Junge dem ersten bei: »Ich kann dir zeigen, was ein hate crime ist. Ich habe eine Waffe.« 
Diesen Erfolg hat Donald Trump schon heute sicher: Das Klima wird rauer, auch in den Suburbs. Sie sind eben keine Welt für sich mehr.
Die Spaltung des Landes vertieft sich, immer noch weiter. In den ländlichen Gegenden, jenseits der Vororte von Philadelphia, haben lokale Parteiaktivisten in den vergangenen vier Jahren ähnlich hart gearbeitet wie Lisa hier in Bucks County. Sie haben Bürger angesprochen, haben an ihren Häusern geklingelt, haben sie zu Treffen eingeladen. Sie haben es geschafft, dass sich mehr als 100.000 neue Wähler registrieren ließen. Nicht für die Demokraten. Sondern für die Republikaner. Mit der Hilfe der Menschen vom Land könnte Donald Trump immer noch Pennsylvania gewinnen und Präsident bleiben. Auch wenn es gerade aussieht, als sei das nicht sehr wahrscheinlich.
Die vielen Demokratinnen im Suburb wissen, dass es auf jede Stimme ankommt. Und die wenigen Republikanerinnen wissen es auch.
Vanessa Fiori wohnt in einem der größten Häuser, die ich während meiner Recherche in den Vororten von Philadelphia gesehen habe. Einem Anwesen eher, mit bewaldeter Auffahrt und eigenem See. Ihr Mann hat es als Erfinder von Sensoren-Technologie zu Reichtum gebracht. Sie trägt eine luftige Bluse, ihre Haare wehen locker im Wind, im Garten hat sie Kuchen und Radieschen bereitgestellt.
Ihre Freundin Cathy Paige, eine Psychologin, ist auch schon da. Es gibt kein großes Vorgeplänkel, keine sonnige Freundlichkeit wie beim Picknick der »Frauen für Trump«. Es geht gleich los, so wie beim Fernsehduell zwischen den beiden Kandidaten. Wen wir denn wählen werden, wollen Vanessa und Cathy von der Fotografin Dina Litovsky und mir wissen.
Biden, sagt die Fotografin. Ich selbst darf in den USA nicht wählen, signalisiere aber, dass ich Trump in mancher Hinsicht problematisch finde.
»Das sind die Gegner«, sagt Vanessa zu Cathy.
Was ich als Interview geplant habe, als Versuch, den beiden Trump-Unterstützerinnen näherzukommen und ihre Positionen zu verstehen, entwickelt sich zu einer Nachhilfestunde in Sachen Wahrheit. Die Armut der Schwarzen, die nicht das Problem der Weißen ist. Die Demokraten, die sich die Schwarzen untertan gemacht haben. Die Milliarden an Sozialhilfe, die der Staat sinnlos ausgibt. Umweltschutz und Menschenrechte als Strategie der Linken, den amerikanischen Individualismus zu schwächen. Vanessa und Cathy werfen sich die Stichworte zu wie Bälle. Auf Twitter sind beide gesperrt, auf Facebook darf niemand mehr Cathys Kommentare lesen. Zu oft haben diese beiden Frauen gegen die Anstandsregeln der Plattformen verstoßen.
Als die Fotografin sie porträtieren möchte, zieht Cathy eine Maske auf. Nicht wegen des Virus. Sondern weil sie nicht voll erkennbar sein will.
Zum Abschied klopft sie mir tröstend auf den Rücken, wie eine Tennisspielerin, die gerade eine Gegnerin vom Platz gefegt hat. Dann zieht sie resigniert die Schultern hoch. Es scheint, als habe sie die Hoffnung aufgegeben, dass ich die Wahrheit begreife. Ich glaube, ein wenig freut sie sich auch über den Verlauf, den unser Gespräch bei Kuchen und Radieschen genommen hat. Denn er bestätigt ihre Meinung: Man kann das System der liberalen Meinungseliten nicht verändern. Man muss es zerstören.
In Pennsylvania wollen sie anfangen. Später an diesem Tag wird Vanessa Fiori in ihrem Vorort an Türen klingeln, um Wähler für Trump zu werben. Und Wählerinnen.

Ein weißes Zeltdach schützt die Speisen vor der warmen Septembersonne von Pennsylvania.
 »Pilates war großartig«, antwortet eine Frau, die wie Shelly Schwab um die sechzig ist und wie Shelly Schwab deutlich jünger aussieht. »I love your t-shirt, Shelly! Wo hast du das her?« 
 Shelly Schwab schaut an sich herab auf das enge schwarze Shirt. »Hat mir eine Freundin geschenkt. Die offiziellen T-Shirts der Wahlkampagne sind alle so groß, die sehen an mir aus wie ein Sack.« Sie zieht den Schriftzug glatt, damit er besser lesbar ist: Trump 2020. Shelly lacht, wendet sich dem nächsten Gast zu und hilft, den Picknickteller zu füllen. 
 Eine Dreiviertelstunde Autofahrt außerhalb von Philadelphia, auf der Wiese eines privaten Sportclubs, treffen sich an diesem Samstagmittag die »Frauen für Trump«. Viele haben ihre ganze Familie mitgebracht, kleine Mädchen in Sommerkleidchen laufen barfuß über den Rasen und spielen mit Luftballons, alte Männer machen es sich in mitgebrachten Strandstühlen bequem und reden. An einem der Picknicktische holt eine Frau ihre rote Make America Great Again -Kappe aus der Tasche. 
»Trägst du die in der Öffentlichkeit?«, fragt die Sitznachbarin.
Die Frau schüttelt den Kopf. »Ich will nicht von den Linken angegriffen werden.«
 Als Reporterin nähert man sich einem Treffen von Trump-Anhängern eher vorsichtig. Für sie sind Journalisten Lügner, Teil der linksliberalen Elite, gegen die Donald Trump darum kämpft, Amerika great again zu machen. Auch ich bin auf seinen Wahlveranstaltungen schon angefeindet worden. Deshalb überrascht und erleichtert es mich, wie freundlich ich hier im Vorort von den Trump-Frauen und ihren Familien begrüßt werde. Manche von ihnen umarmen mich gleich. Das ist mir dann schon wieder zu viel des Guten. Denn außer mir trägt niemand eine Maske. 
Als ich die Pandemie anspreche, fallen an dem Tisch, an dem ich sitze, »Keine Panik«-Sätze. Ist doch alles übertrieben. Hat in dieser Gegend kaum jemand. Masken sind höchstens etwas für dicht besiedelte Großstädte. Dass Donald Trump drei Wochen später selbst erkranken wird, scheint den Frauen an diesem idyllischen Picknick-Samstag unvorstellbar. Das Coronavirus ist für sie kein großes Thema.
Ihr großes Thema sind die Linken.
»Die Professoren manipulieren unsere Kinder«, heißt es am Picknicktisch
»Ich bin so froh, Gleichgesinnte zu treffen. Princeton ist so schrecklich liberal«, sagt eine Frau Mitte sechzig, die aus dem nahen Uni-Städtchen angereist ist und dort von den Einkünften aus ihrem Immobilienbesitz lebt, wie sie erzählt.
Eine andere: »Die Professoren dort manipulieren unsere Kinder. Meine Tochter sagte mir kürzlich, ich müsse mir meiner Privilegien als weiße Frau bewusst werden!«
Eine ehemalige Sekretärin, Mitte siebzig: »Obama durften wir nicht kritisieren, nur weil der Hurensohn schwarz war. Aber die Demokraten dürfen Trump jeden Schimpfnamen verpassen.«
Die Immobilienbesitzerin aus Princeton: »Wir sind die schweigende Mehrheit.«
Dann stehen die Frauen auf, um sich etwas zu essen zu holen, und auf die freien Plätze an meinem Tisch setzt sich Julia mit ihren beiden Söhnen, 13 und 19 Jahre alt. Ihre drei älteren Töchter, erzählt sie, sind schon aus dem Haus. Julia Snyder ist 59, trägt schwarze Leggins und will ihren echten Namen nicht veröffentlicht sehen. Sie hat mal in New York als Investmentbankerin gearbeitet. Vor knapp 30 Jahren gab sie ihren Job auf und zog mit ihrem Mann nach Yardley, einem der ältesten und wohlhabendsten Vororte von Philadelphia in eine Welt der stattlichen Einfamilienhäuser, jedes umgeben von einem großen, gepflegten Rasengrundstück. Julia sagt, sie liebe die Weite und die unbebaute Landschaft um Yardley herum. Alte Bäume, wogende Maisfelder. Farmen, auf denen man im Sommer mit der Familie Beeren pflücken kann und im Winter Kürbisse kaufen. Es gibt einen idyllischen Bauernmarkt, und die freiwillige Feuerwehr wurde vor einigen Jahren zur besten im ganzen Regierungsbezirk gewählt. Kann man sich einen schöneren Ort vorstellen, um fünf Kinder großzuziehen?
Sie komme aus einem Elternhaus, in dem man immer für die Demokraten war, sagt Julia Snyder. Als junge Frau sei sie dann von Ronald Reagan begeistert gewesen. »Ihn habe ich gewählt, als ich zum ersten Mal meine Stimme abgeben durfte. Seitdem wähle ich die Republikaner. Und diesmal wieder Trump. Das steht fest.«
Auf das Picknick stieß ich, als ich mich auf die Suche nach den »Vorstadtfrauen« machte, über die in den vergangenen Monaten viel berichtet wurde, wenn vom Kampf zwischen Donald Trump und Joe Biden um das Weiße Haus die Rede war. Trump und Biden sind sich bekanntlich über kaum etwas einig. Wenn es aber darum geht, welche Wählergruppe bei dieser Wahl eine entscheidende Rolle spielt, dann dürften die beiden doch einer Meinung sein. Es sind nicht die schwarzen Großstädter oder die Latinos in den Südstaaten. Auf die weißen Frauen aus den Suburbs kommt es an.
Die amerikanischen Vororte sind so etwas wie eine Transitzone. Sie sind weder Großstadt noch Provinz, weder gebildet-liberal noch konservativ-ländlich, genauer gesagt: Sie sind beides. Hier scheinen die Menschen nicht so festgelegt auf eine politische Identität zu sein wie im Rest des Landes, hier leben besonders viele Wechselwähler, die sich mal für die eine, mal für die andere Seite entscheiden.
Es gibt das Bild des typischen Trump-Wählers, an dem Soziologen, Journalisten und ratlose Vertreter der alten politischen Eliten seit Jahren zeichnen. Dieses Bild zeigt einen wütenden Mann. Er ist arm und lebt in einer Gegend, mit der es seit Langem bergab geht, vielleicht hat der Mann selbst seinen Job verloren. Er ist so laut und aggressiv, weil er nicht mehr gebraucht wird. Dafür macht er das Establishment verantwortlich.
Das Bild ist nicht falsch. Aber es zeigt nur einen Ausschnitt der Wirklichkeit.
Schöne Häuser, große Autos, viel Grün. Woher kommt das Gefühl der Bedrohung?
Die materiell abgesicherten, gut ausgebildeten weißen Frauen aus den prosperierenden Vororten es scheint, als hätten sie mit dem wütenden Mann kaum etwas gemein, nur die Hautfarbe. Und doch hat bei der Wahl 2016 fast jede zweite von ihnen für Donald Trump gestimmt. Was er dann allerdings mit dem Amt anstellte, zu dem sie ihm verholfen hatten, hat nicht mehr allen diesen Frauen gefallen. Da waren die plumpen Komplimente, die Trump der Ehefrau seines Amtskollegen aus Frankreich machte. Da waren die sexistischen Kommentare über Journalistinnen, die es wagten, ihn zu kritisieren. Da war sein ganzes breitbeiniges männliches Auftreten, das sie täglich im Fernsehen vorgeführt bekamen, zuletzt vergangene Woche im TV-Duell mit Joe Biden. Trump war ihnen peinlich.
Schaut man sich heute die Umfragen an, dann ist das Verhältnis zwischen Trump-Anhängern und Biden-Anhängern in den amerikanischen Suburbs bei den Männern noch einigermaßen ausgeglichen. Anders bei den Frauen. Von ihnen sagt inzwischen eine große Mehrheit: Ich werde Biden wählen. Viele haben die Seiten gewechselt. Trump kann Stimme um Stimme von den wütenden männlichen Verlierern einsammeln, das allein wird ihm nicht helfen. Er braucht Erfolge in den Vororten. Er braucht Frauen wie Julia.
Irgendetwas an Trump und den Republikanern muss es geben, das diese Frauen zumindest empfänglich macht für ihre Botschaften. Was genau?
Je länger ich mich mit Julia am Picknicktisch unterhalte, desto mehr fällt mir auf, wie sehr sie von Werten redet, die man klassisch bürgerlich nennen könnte. Bildung. Leistung. Geradlinigkeit. Sie sagt, sie habe damals ganz bewusst ihren Job aufgegeben. Sie wollte für ihre Kinder da sein, wollte ihnen diese Werte vorleben. Ihr Mann, der politisch ähnlich denkt wie sie, verdiente als Chemiker bei einem Pharmakonzern genug. »Wie Frauen Beruf und Familie vereinbaren können, ist mir ein Rätsel.« Und Julia ist nicht enttäuscht worden, sie hat viele ihrer Ziele erreicht. Alle fünf Kinder sind gläubig erzogen, sie haben diverse Auszeichnungen in der Schule erhalten, jedes spricht mindestens eine Fremdsprache und spielt ein Streichinstrument. Dazu noch Klavier.
Julia braucht sich um die Zukunft ihrer Kinder keine Sorgen zu machen, könnte man meinen. Der Vorort hat sie auf die Welt da draußen ziemlich gut vorbereitet. Deshalb verwundert es mich, als Julia sagt, sie habe Angst davor, wie es ihren beiden Jungs im Leben ergehen werde. »Als christliche weiße Männer haben sie in unserer Welt doch eine Zielscheibe auf dem Rücken.«
 Wo ich eine erfolgreiche Frau sehe, die Anlass hätte zur Gelassenheit, scheint sie selbst nur Gefahren zu sehen, für ihren Lebensstil, ihre Kinder, all ihre Gewissheiten. Es fing damit an, dass die Arbeit ihres Mannes nach Indien outgesourct wurde. Er fand einen neuen Job, sagt Julia, aber bei einer weniger renommierten Firma. War das der Segen der von den liberalen Eliten gepriesenen Globalisierung? Warum, fragt Julia, nannten die Lehrer ihrer Kinder im Unterricht plötzlich Gründe, weshalb man nicht mehr stolz sein dürfe auf die USA? Warum hängten sie Plakate auf mit der Aufschrift No place for hate? »Was soll das? Amerika ist kein Ort des Hasses!« 
 Ich kann sie ein Stück weit verstehen. Auch ich erlebe, wie bereitwillig sich öffentliche Institutionen oder auch Unternehmen und Hollywoodstars in den USA linke Anliegen zu eigen machen. Neulich schrieb die Direktorin der Schule meiner Tochter in New York eine E-Mail an die Eltern. Unter ihren Namen setzte sie die weiblichen Pronomen she / her . Sie wollte demonstrieren, dass ihre Weiblichkeit nicht selbstverständlich ist. Dass jeder Mensch sein Geschlecht wählen dürfen soll. In vielen Firmen und öffentlichen Einrichtungen wird das mittlerweile von den Mitarbeitern gewünscht, wenn sie E-Mails verschicken. 
 Ich habe mich darüber gewundert, aber es war mir letztlich egal. Geärgert habe ich mich, als die liberale New York Times den Chef ihrer Meinungsseite entließ, weil er den Beitrag eines konservativen Senators abgedruckt hatte. Junge progressive Redakteure hatten Druck auf die Chefredaktion ausgeübt. Wer sich in der liberalen amerikanischen Sphäre heute öffentlich äußert, muss sich ständig gegen Rechts abgrenzen. Wo eine Gesellschaft miteinander debattieren sollte, gibt es kaum noch Spielraum für Gedanken und Beobachtungen, die nicht ins Raster passen. 
Ich kenne noch andere Amerikaner, die wie Julia Donald Trump bewundern und die mitunter sehr gebildete, zugängliche, auf den ersten Blick sympathische Leute sind. Je länger unsere Unterhaltung dauert, desto mehr spricht Julia dann allerdings mit einer fast verzweifelten Dringlichkeit. Beugt sich zu mir herüber, warnt wie eine Dissidentin: »Wir müssen vorsichtig sein! Die Leute in der Schulbehörde mögen es nicht, wenn man so etwas erwähnt.« Und: »Dahinter stecken mächtige Interessen.«
Es ist, als ziehe diese so freundliche Frau plötzlich von innen alle Vorhänge zu. Und im abgedunkelten Raum macht für sie alles Sinn. Die Herrschaft der sogenannten Globalisten, die Amerika in den Kommunismus treiben wollen. George Soros. Barack Obama. Black Lives Matter. »Hollywood ist auch voller Kommunisten«, sagt Julia und ergänzt fast erschöpft: »Trump ist unsere einzige Rettung.«
»Mama? Können wir jetzt endlich nach Hause?«, fragt ihr 19-Jähriger. Vorhang aufgezogen. Plötzlich ist es wieder hell.
Das Abgleiten in Verschwörungstheorien und die Verehrung Donald Trumps als nationaler Erlöser sind mir nicht unbekannt. Dafür war ich zu oft auf Trumps Massenveranstaltungen, er hat sie ja bis kurz vor seiner Erkrankung abgehalten, auch hier im Bundesstaat Pennsylvania. Da sieht man sie, die Männer vom Land, die sich aufpeitschen lassen. Legt sich die Apokalypse-Tonspur aber über das friedliche Bild einer Mutter mit ihren Kindern an einem Picknicktisch, mitten in einem bürgerlichen Vorort voller Grün, dann ist das ziemlich irritierend. Ich kann mich mit Julia wunderbar unterhalten. Und ich kann mich mit ihr nicht verständigen, denn sie nutzt anders als ich keine klassischen Medien. Ihr Gut-gegen-Böse-Weltbild hat sie aus dem Paralleluniversum rechter Websites und Podcasts. Dort findet sie eine Sprache für das Gefühl der Bedrohung.
Vor ein paar Tagen habe ich Julia angerufen. Ich wollte wissen, wie sie darauf reagiert, dass ihr Held in einem Krankenhaus gegen Covid-19 kämpfen musste. Julia klang nicht sehr besorgt. Für sie hat die Pandemie wenig mit Medizin zu tun und viel mit Politik. In den Warnungen der Demokraten vor dem Virus sieht sie den Versuch, das Freiheitsrecht des amerikanischen Volkes zu beschränken. »Trump ist stark, ein bisschen wie ein Übermensch.« Er werde die Krankheit schnell überstehen und dadurch beweisen, dass sie nicht so schlimm ist. Ein weiterer Sieg des Guten über das Böse.
Donald Trump hat Pennsylvania 2016 mit lediglich 44.000 Stimmen Vorsprung gewonnen. Wer Präsident werden will, der muss hier auch dieses Mal wieder die Mehrheit der Stimmen holen an Pennsylvania führt nach Ansicht der meisten Experten so gut wie kein Weg vorbei. Die Frau, die daran mitgewirkt hat, dass Trumps Chancen diesmal nicht mehr so gut stehen, heißt Lisa.
Ich bin mit ihr in einem Starbucks-Café verabredet, in demselben kleinen Einkaufszentrum, auf dessen Rückseite der Sportclub liegt, wo sich die »Frauen für Trump« zum Picknick trafen. Lisa und ihr Mann wohnen nicht weit von hier in einem Reihenhaus. Sie ist 56 und Informatikerin, sie trägt eine Maske mit einem Herzen darauf und erzählt von ihrem Kampf um die Seele des Vororts, so nüchtern wie eine Forscherin von einem Experiment.
 »Da ist schon wieder einer!« Lisa zeigt streng auf einen Truck, der an der Starbucks-Terrasse vorbeifährt. Auf der Ladefläche sind zwei riesige Trump 2020 -Flaggen montiert. Ihr eigenes Auto, vor uns auf dem Parkplatz, ist vollgestopft mit BIDEN-Schildern für die Vorgärten. Die hat sie selbst herstellen lassen, in der Druckerei einer Gewerkschaft. Die Biden-Wahlkampagne hat nämlich hier im Landkreis Bucks County, zu dem Yardley und weitere Vororte gehören, noch kein eigenes Hauptquartier. »Alles läuft virtuell, wegen Covid. Ganz schön nervig.« Die Gegenseite, sagt Lisa, nimmt keine Rücksicht auf die Pandemie und schickt ihre Leute los, um Schilder, Plakate und Flaggen zu verteilen. Wer jetzt in den Vororten unterwegs ist, liest überall TRUMP und fast nirgendwo BIDEN. Das muss sich dringend ändern, findet Lisa. Nicht dass es noch ein zweites 2016 gibt. 
Lisa heißt zwar wirklich Lisa, aber auch sie will nicht, dass ihr Nachname in der Zeitung erwähnt wird und dass man dort ihr Gesicht sehen kann. Ihr Mann ist überzeugter Trump-Fan, was aber kaum jemand weiß, und sie haben eine kleine Firma der wolle sie keine Probleme bereiten, sagt sie. Firmen im Besitz von Trump-Anhängern werden in dieser Gegend schon mal boykottiert. Es ist manchmal kompliziert mit dem Freund-Feind-Denken.
Lisas Kontaktanzeige im Netz: Einsame Demokratin sucht andere Demokraten
Angefangen habe alles in der Wahlnacht vor vier Jahren, sagt Lisa. Sie saß damals in ihrem Wohnzimmer vor dem Fernseher, allein. Ihr Mann war durchaus zu Hause, nur schaute er die Wahlen auf dem Fernseher im Schlafzimmer. In den Monaten davor hatte sich zwischen ihnen das Schweigen ausgebreitet. Wie der Mann, den sie seit College-Zeiten kennt, mit dem sie zwei Kinder bekam, wie dieser fürsorgliche Mensch plötzlich einen Hass auf die Kandidatin Hillary Clinton entwickeln und in ihr nichts als ein »elitäres Biest« sehen konnte, das ging Lisa nicht in den Kopf. Er war immer ein moderater Republikaner gewesen, und Politik hatte zwischen den beiden nie für Probleme gesorgt. Nun, in den Wochen vor den Wahlen 2016, geschah es einmal sogar, dass sie ins Wohnzimmer kam und dort ihren Mann sitzen sah, hinter ihm der Fernseher, der das Standbild einer Trump-Kundgebung zeigte.
»Kriegt er euch so rum? Mit TV-Osmose?«, fragte sie ihn gereizt. Dabei hatte ihr Mann nur auf Pause gedrückt, um keinen Streit über Trump zu provozieren. Nein, sie beide in der Wahlnacht vor dem Fernseher, das wäre nicht gut gegangen, sagt Lisa heute.
Damals schaute sie also ganz allein zu, wie ihr Heimatstaat auf den Grafiken von CNN rot wurde. Sieg für Trump. Zuerst war sie einfach nur enttäuscht. Dann griff sie zu ihrem Computer und stellte eine Art Kontaktanzeige ins Internet: Einsame Demokratin sucht andere Demokraten zum Reden. 70 Verzweifelte meldeten sich. Fast nur Frauen.
In den Tagen danach reckten in den Vororten von Philadelphia immer mehr Trump-Gegner ihre Köpfe, wie Spargelspitzen, die an die Luft müssen. Bald gab es unzählige Gruppen, alle wollten mithelfen, die Demokratische Partei in den Suburbs zu erneuern. Die Parteifunktionäre hatten es im Wahlkampf versäumt, die Bewohner anzusprechen. Trump wählt hier sowieso niemand, hatten sie selbstzufrieden gedacht.
Die lokalen Gruppen schlossen sich zu einer Organisation zusammen. In den folgenden Jahren suchten Lisa und die anderen Frauen für die Demokraten Kandidaten für Lokalwahlen aus, telefonierten Wähler ab, liefen von Tür zu Tür, veranstalteten Fragerunden. Bei den Kongresswahlen 2018 zahlte sich ihr Einsatz aus: Dank der Stimmen aus den Vororten eroberten die Demokraten das Repräsentantenhaus in Washington. Sie gewannen Posten in lokalen Schulbehörden, die in den USA durch Wahlen bestimmt werden, nahmen den Republikanern Plätze im Parlament des Bundesstaates weg. Und stellen seit Januar 2020 zum ersten Mal in fast 40 Jahren die Mehrheit der Lokalregierung von Bucks County.
In ihrer Fassungslosigkeit darüber, dass dieser Mann Präsident werden konnte, hatte Lisa mitgeholfen, den Republikanern die Kontrolle über den Vorort zu entreißen. Sie hatte Julia Snyder und die anderen »Frauen für Trump« in Vertreter einer politischen Minderheit verwandelt.
Lisa und Julia kennen einander nicht. Sie leben beide an demselben Ort, aber ihre Antworten auf die Frage, was diesen Ort bedroht, könnten unterschiedlicher nicht sein. Setze ich mich ins Auto und fahre die ruhigen Vorstadtstraßen von Bucks County ab, dann fallen mir in der Tat Unterschiede auf. Manche Häuser sind sehr breit, andere nicht ganz so breit. Manche haben eine stattliche Auffahrt, andere stehen dichter am Nachbarhaus. Manche sind aus Stein gebaut, andere aus Holz.
Aber ich finde, allzu groß sind die Unterschiede nicht. Es sind ja fast alles Einfamilienhäuser mit Garten. Der Rasen ist meist sehr kurz, jedes Haus ist gepflegt und kündet von Wohlstand. Fast nirgendwo sieht man Zäune. Fast überall sieht man Grills. Könnten diese Häuser sprechen, müsste sich das, was sie zu sagen hätten, ziemlich ähnlich anhören.
Trump hat ein Label für die Vorortfrauen: Er nennt sie »suburban housewives«
Vor etwa 70 Jahren hatten zwei Brüder eine geniale Idee. Die Brüder hießen William und Alfred Levitt und stammten aus Brooklyn. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs hatte die Baufirma ihres Vaters für die U. S. Army schnell und effizient 2350 Militärbaracken errichtet. Egal, wo sie gebraucht wurden, die Unterkünfte schienen immer schon da zu sein. Nun war der Krieg vorbei, und in New York, Philadelphia und anderen Großstädten herrschte Wohnungsnot. Einwanderer aus Europa. Afroamerikaner aus dem Süden der USA. Kriegsheimkehrer mit dem Traum, endlich eine Familie zu gründen. Sie alle brauchten jetzt ein neues Zuhause. Bald waren die großen Städte überfüllt. Gewalt, Kriminalität und Drogenmissbrauch stiegen an.
Was gut für die U. S. Army ist, kann nicht falsch sein für alle Amerikaner, dachten sich Alfred und William Levitt. Zuerst nahe New York, dann bei Philadelphia errichteten sie auf billigem Farmland die beiden ersten modernen Vororte Amerikas: die Levittowns. Das Levittown von Bucks County, nur ein paar Kilometer von Julias und Lisas Häusern entfernt, zählt bis heute zu den größten von einer Hand geplanten Siedlungen der USA.
Die Käufer konnten sich zwischen sechs Varianten entscheiden. Da war das kalifornisch inspirierte Modell Levittowner für 10.990 Dollar. Der Country Clubber, doppelt so groß: 18.990 Dollar. Der Jubilee, mit Garage: 11.600 Dollar. Der Pennsylvanian: 14.500 Dollar. Der Colonial: 14.990 Dollar. Der doppelstöckige Rancher für die kinderreiche Familie: 8990 Dollar. 17.311 Häuser, von 1952 bis 1958 in Massenproduktion gefertigt, ähnlich wie die Autos, die all die Menschen kauften, die nun aus den Innenstädten herauszogen.
In den 1950ern und 1960ern fanden 20 Millionen Amerikaner in den beiden Levittowns und ihren unzähligen Nachfolgern eine neue Heimat. Sie flohen zunächst vor der Armut und der Kriminalität, später flohen sie auch vor den Rassenunruhen, den immer neuen Wellen an Einwanderern, dem ganzen chaotischen Leben in einer zunehmend liberalen Gesellschaft. Es war die größte Bevölkerungswanderung, die Amerika je erlebt hat.
Man könnte denken, die Häuser von Levittown hätten jedem offengestanden, der sich den Kauf leisten konnte. So war es bei den Autos ja auch. Allerdings ist die Frage, wer wo lebt, viel politischer als die Frage, wer welches Auto besitzt. Schwarzen, selbst denen mit gutem Job und sicherem Einkommen, blieb der Weg in die Vororte fast immer versperrt. Sie bekamen von den Banken einfach keinen halbwegs bezahlbaren Kredit. In Levittown war sogar der Weiterverkauf eines Hauses an Schwarze verboten, dazu musste sich jeder neue Besitzer per Unterschrift verpflichten. So kam es, dass die Mehrheit der Afroamerikaner als Mieter in den Städten blieb. Die Weißen wurden Hausbesitzer und legten den Grundstein für ihren Wohlstand.
Auch in Deutschland ziehen Menschen in Vororte. Aber ein deutscher Vorort ist etwas anderes als ein amerikanischer Suburb. Im Vorort kauft man sich ein Haus, weil man ins Grüne will, weil man sich mehr Platz und einen Garten wünscht und sich all dies vielleicht in der Stadt nicht leisten kann. Wer sich aber in den USA für ein Leben im Suburb entscheidet, der entscheidet sich für einen Ort, der geschaffen wurde, um ein vergangenes Amerika zu bewahren. Das Versprechen der Suburbs ist, historisch gesehen, das Versprechen vom Sieg des Konformismus über den sozialen Unterschied.
Deshalb standen Bewohnerinnen von Levittown, Bucks County, im Jahr 1957 in Caprihosen und mit Lockenfrisur vor einem der Tausenden gleichförmigen Häuser und protestierten gegen den Einzug von Daisy und William Myers und ihren drei Kindern. Familie Myers war die erste schwarze Familie in Levittown, Bürgerrechtler hatten den Kauf des Hauses über Umwege arrangiert. Die weißen Nachbarn und Nachbarinnen schmissen Steine durch die Fenster ins Innere des Hauses und warfen Zigarettenstummel auf das Grundstück. Einmal brannte ein zweieinhalb Meter großes Kreuz im Vorgarten. Familie Myers hielt es vier Jahre lang in Levittown aus.
Deshalb beklagt sich die Trump-Anhängerin Julia im Jahr 2020 bei mir darüber, was die Demokraten aus dem idyllischen Bucks County machen, jetzt, wo sie es wegen ihrer lokalpolitischen Erfolge durchsetzen können: Überall werde gebaut. Statt schöner frei stehender Häuser mit Garten werden jetzt tatsächlich auch platzsparende Reihenhäuser zugelassen. »Das ist wie in der Stadt«, sagt Julia. Die Reihenhäuser sind nur der Anfang, glaubt sie. »Irgendwann kommen die Sozialwohnungen und damit die Probleme.« Sie meint: Irgendwann kommen die Armen, in der Regel Afroamerikaner. Die Hochhäuser. Die Drogen. Die Kriminalität.
Und deshalb geht es im Wahlkampf der Republikaner ständig um die Gefahren, vor denen die Suburbs beschützt werden müssen. Nach den Protesten gegen Polizeigewalt in amerikanischen Städten sieht Trump jetzt die Chance, seinen Rückstand bei den Vorortfrauen aufzuholen, indem er das alte Versprechen erneuert.
Donald Trump auf Twitter an die Bewohnerinnen der Suburbs, 23. Juli 2020: »Biden wird eure Viertel zerstören und euren Amerikanischen Traum. Ich werde ihn bewahren und ihn sogar besser machen!«
Nominierungsparteitag der Republikaner, 24. August: Das Video eines Ehepaars aus einem Vorort von St. Louis wird eingespielt. Die Demokraten, sagen die beiden, »wollen die Suburbs abschaffen. Sie wollen Verbrechen und Gesetzlosigkeit in blühende Nachbarschaften bringen.«
Kundgebung in Michigan, 10. September: Trump spielt eine Art Sketch zwischen einer imaginären Ehefrau und ihrem Mann. Der Mann: »Schatz, weißt du, wer nebenan eingezogen ist?« Die Frau: »Oh, es ist einer von Antifa? Lass uns um Himmels willen von hier wegziehen. Lass uns unseren Vorort verlassen. Ich wünschte, Donald Trump wäre Präsident. Er hätte das nicht zugelassen.«
Die Botschaft liefert Trump seinem Publikum gleich mit: »Die Suburbs sind der Amerikanische Traum, das sage ich euch, ich habe eure Suburbs beschützt!«
 Trump hat sogar ein eigenes Label für die Vorortfrauen. Bei früheren Wahlen hießen sie soccer moms, später dann security moms. Trump nennt sie suburban housewives. Es ist ein Label, das weit in die Vergangenheit weist, in eine Zeit, als es in Bucks County wirklich nur Hausfrauen gab. Lauter Julias, die sich vor der Welt da draußen fürchteten. 
In einem sonnigen Park inmitten von Levittown sitzen drei Frauen aus drei Generationen: Barbara Bill, ihre Tochter Cindy Murphy und ihre Enkeltochter Dana Paglario. In der Nähe rollen gerade ein paar Frauen ihre Yogamatten ein, weiter hinten auf der grünen Wiese trainieren Mädchen, ja, was wohl? Soccer. Yoga und Frauenfußball beides gab es hier noch nicht, als Barbara 1969 in ein Haus in der Nähe zog. Sie ist 82 und trägt farblich genau abgestimmten Schmuck, auf ihrem Kopf sitzt wie eine Krone eines dieser Rundum-Plastikvisiere gegen das Virus. »Beim Highschool-Abschluss war ich Jahrgangsbeste«, erzählt sie kokett. Sie arbeitete kurz als Sekretärin, dann kamen die Kinder, und Barbara wurde eine Vorort-Hausfrau. Die Demokraten hat sie trotzdem immer gewählt.
Barbara ruckelt an ihrem Visier. »Mama, mach dir keine Sorgen um deine Frisur, du siehst klasse aus!« Cindy, 56, hat die raue, selbstbewusste Stimme einer Kirmeschefin. Sie wohnt bei ihrer Mutter um die Ecke. Ihre beiden Brüder gingen nicht auf die Uni, Cindy aber wagte den Schritt nach der Scheidung von ihrem ersten Mann. Zehn Jahre brauchte sie neben Job und Kindern für den College-Abschluss, sie war der Erste in der Familie, dem das gelang. Heute arbeitet sie bei einer Bank und sitzt für die Demokraten im Stadtrat. »Als Dana mal mit einem Schwarzen zusammen war, brachte einer unserer Verwandten einen dummen Spruch. Dem hab ich gesagt: Hör auf mit der Scheiße!«
Dana, 24, nickt und trägt etwas Lipgloss auf. Was nicht ganz einfach ist, denn sie hat enorme Fingernägel. Auch Dana hat studiert, sie arbeitet als Grundschullehrerin. Seit der Trennung von ihrem letzten Freund lebt sie wieder im Haus ihrer Mutter hier in Levittown.
Es macht Freude, Cindy, Barbara und Dana dabei zuzuhören, wie sie aus ihrem Leben erzählen. Sie besitzen diese angenehme Selbstsicherheit, die man braucht, um über sich selbst zu lachen. Mir fällt auf, wie viel stabiler sie im Vergleich zu Julia wirken. Sie spielen zwar keine Streichinstrumente, und Cindys zweiter Mann ist kein hoch spezialisierter Chemiker, sondern Lastwagenfahrer. Ihr Vorortleben ist bescheidener als das von Julia. Dennoch wirken die drei auf mich irgendwie verwurzelter.
Die amerikanischen Suburbs sind nicht mehr die Orte, die sie einmal waren, und das liegt vor allem an den Frauen. Es waren Frauen, die seit den 1970ern massenhaft die Vororte verließen, um zu studieren und zu arbeiten. Es waren oft Frauen, die sich nicht vorschreiben lassen wollten, welchen amerikanischen Traum sie träumen sollen. Sie öffneten sich für die Welt, und mit ihnen die Suburbs. In Bucks County ist der Anteil der Schwarzen an der Bevölkerung immer noch zwei Drittel niedriger als im Landesdurchschnitt. Aber viele gut ausgebildete Einwanderer aus Asien sind hergezogen. Und junge Familien aus dem liberalen New York, denen es dort zu teuer geworden ist.
Das Klima wird rauer, auch in den Suburbs. Sie sind keine Welt für sich mehr
Kaum jemand hat vom Wandel der amerikanischen Gesellschaft mehr profitiert als Frauen wie Cindy, Barbara und Dana. Die amerikanischen Arbeiter hat die Globalisierung ärmer gemacht. Die Gottgläubigen hat der Liberalismus ins kulturelle Abseits gedrängt. Die Vorortfrauen dagegen sind immer unabhängiger, haben ein immer höheres Einkommen und bemühen sich immer öfter darum, die Grenzen zwischen Suburb und Stadt einzureißen.
Vor Corona, erzählt Dana, sei sie jeden Tag in die Stadt gependelt, ihre Grundschule liegt in einem der sozial schwächsten Viertel von Philadelphia. Fast alle Kinder dort sind schwarz, Dana ist eine der wenigen weißen Lehrerinnen. Als ich sie bitte, ihre Arbeit zu beschreiben, wird sie vorsichtig, ringt um die richtigen Worte. »Das Unterrichten ist hart ... weißt du, was ich meine? Mir ist so ein Unterschied aufgefallen ... zwischen der Mitarbeit .... also dem Engagement der Kinder .... in der Stadt und ... na ja, im Suburb. Die Kinder ... Das sind die süßesten Kinder, aber ... es ist einfach ... ich glaube ... ihr Umfeld ist härter.«
Dana weiß, sie kämpft gegen die Folgen der großen Flucht der Weißen vor den Schwarzen, die vor 70 Jahren hier begann, in Levittown. Sie will weder den schwarzen Kindern noch deren Eltern die Schuld geben für die schlechten Schulleistungen. Für all die Probleme zu Hause. Das mangelnde Engagement der Mütter, die Abwesenheit der Väter. Das tut ja schon Donald Trump.
Aber die Sorgen, mit denen Trump da spielt, sind weit verbreitet, viel weiter, als man vermuten könnte. Sie beschäftigen auch Vorortfrauen, die ihn nicht wählen. Auch sie fühlen sich verantwortlich für das Wohl ihrer Familie, machen sich Gedanken um die Sicherheit ihrer Söhne und Töchter. Wie wäre das, wenn mehr Kinder aus sozial schwachen Familien bei uns im Suburb auf die Schule gingen? Würden meine Kinder dann weniger lernen? Hätten sie einen schlechteren Start ins Leben? Ist nicht vielleicht doch was dran an den Warnungen vor Chaos und Gewalt, die unsere Idylle unter Bäumen bedrohen?
Von Trump erwarten sich Dana, Cindy und Barbara allerdings keine Lösung des Problems. Im Gegenteil.
In New Hope, einem anderen wohlhabenden Vorort von Philadelphia, entdeckte neulich ein Gast in »Freds Frühstücks-Café« ein rassistisches Poster. Es machte sich über Sozialhilfeempfänger lustig: »Heute Morgen wollte ich meine Hunde für Sozialhilfe anmelden. Zuerst sagt die Lady im Amt, Hunde bekommen keine Sozialhilfe. Dann erklärte ich ihr, dass meine Hunde gemischtrassig sind, arbeitslos, kein Englisch sprechen und keine Ahnung haben, wer ihre Väter sind ... Am Freitag erhalten sie ihre erste Zahlung.« Der Besitzer entschuldigte sich: War nicht so gemeint. War ja nur ein Witz.
 Ende Juli postete ein Junge aus Bucks County im Internet Drohungen gegen eine 16-jährige schwarze Mitschülerin. Sie erzeuge bei ihm den Wunsch, ein Hassdelikt gegen sie zu begehen. In einem zweiten Post sprang ein anderer Junge dem ersten bei: »Ich kann dir zeigen, was ein hate crime ist. Ich habe eine Waffe.« 
Diesen Erfolg hat Donald Trump schon heute sicher: Das Klima wird rauer, auch in den Suburbs. Sie sind eben keine Welt für sich mehr.
Die Spaltung des Landes vertieft sich, immer noch weiter. In den ländlichen Gegenden, jenseits der Vororte von Philadelphia, haben lokale Parteiaktivisten in den vergangenen vier Jahren ähnlich hart gearbeitet wie Lisa hier in Bucks County. Sie haben Bürger angesprochen, haben an ihren Häusern geklingelt, haben sie zu Treffen eingeladen. Sie haben es geschafft, dass sich mehr als 100.000 neue Wähler registrieren ließen. Nicht für die Demokraten. Sondern für die Republikaner. Mit der Hilfe der Menschen vom Land könnte Donald Trump immer noch Pennsylvania gewinnen und Präsident bleiben. Auch wenn es gerade aussieht, als sei das nicht sehr wahrscheinlich.
Die vielen Demokratinnen im Suburb wissen, dass es auf jede Stimme ankommt. Und die wenigen Republikanerinnen wissen es auch.
Vanessa Fiori wohnt in einem der größten Häuser, die ich während meiner Recherche in den Vororten von Philadelphia gesehen habe. Einem Anwesen eher, mit bewaldeter Auffahrt und eigenem See. Ihr Mann hat es als Erfinder von Sensoren-Technologie zu Reichtum gebracht. Sie trägt eine luftige Bluse, ihre Haare wehen locker im Wind, im Garten hat sie Kuchen und Radieschen bereitgestellt.
Ihre Freundin Cathy Paige, eine Psychologin, ist auch schon da. Es gibt kein großes Vorgeplänkel, keine sonnige Freundlichkeit wie beim Picknick der »Frauen für Trump«. Es geht gleich los, so wie beim Fernsehduell zwischen den beiden Kandidaten. Wen wir denn wählen werden, wollen Vanessa und Cathy von der Fotografin Dina Litovsky und mir wissen.
Biden, sagt die Fotografin. Ich selbst darf in den USA nicht wählen, signalisiere aber, dass ich Trump in mancher Hinsicht problematisch finde.
»Das sind die Gegner«, sagt Vanessa zu Cathy.
Was ich als Interview geplant habe, als Versuch, den beiden Trump-Unterstützerinnen näherzukommen und ihre Positionen zu verstehen, entwickelt sich zu einer Nachhilfestunde in Sachen Wahrheit. Die Armut der Schwarzen, die nicht das Problem der Weißen ist. Die Demokraten, die sich die Schwarzen untertan gemacht haben. Die Milliarden an Sozialhilfe, die der Staat sinnlos ausgibt. Umweltschutz und Menschenrechte als Strategie der Linken, den amerikanischen Individualismus zu schwächen. Vanessa und Cathy werfen sich die Stichworte zu wie Bälle. Auf Twitter sind beide gesperrt, auf Facebook darf niemand mehr Cathys Kommentare lesen. Zu oft haben diese beiden Frauen gegen die Anstandsregeln der Plattformen verstoßen.
Als die Fotografin sie porträtieren möchte, zieht Cathy eine Maske auf. Nicht wegen des Virus. Sondern weil sie nicht voll erkennbar sein will.
Zum Abschied klopft sie mir tröstend auf den Rücken, wie eine Tennisspielerin, die gerade eine Gegnerin vom Platz gefegt hat. Dann zieht sie resigniert die Schultern hoch. Es scheint, als habe sie die Hoffnung aufgegeben, dass ich die Wahrheit begreife. Ich glaube, ein wenig freut sie sich auch über den Verlauf, den unser Gespräch bei Kuchen und Radieschen genommen hat. Denn er bestätigt ihre Meinung: Man kann das System der liberalen Meinungseliten nicht verändern. Man muss es zerstören.
In Pennsylvania wollen sie anfangen. Später an diesem Tag wird Vanessa Fiori in ihrem Vorort an Türen klingeln, um Wähler für Trump zu werben. Und Wählerinnen."

TYPE: NEWS PROGRAM
SPEAKER: CHRIS KREBS, FORMER DIRECTOR OF CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY
 (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) 
 CHRIS KREBS, FORMER DIRECTOR OF CYBERSECURITY AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY: The American people have had four years to prepare to be more discerning consumers of information, to pick up a couple techniques, and I think we are more resilient, more prepared particularly for foreign interference, but also from any avenue of information. 
 (END VIDEOCLIP) 
KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: One day before the election an upbeat Chris Krebs told me he trusted Americans were wise to disinformation, even the kind that comes from the White House. 
 Fast forward and the ousted cybersecurity chief just filed a defamation lawsuit against the Trump campaign, one of its lawyers, and a TV news outlet. Trump campaign lawyer, Joe diGenova, said in an interview on Newsmax that Krebs should be shot for denying the vote was rigged. 
 The lawsuit claims and angry mob immediately bombarded Krebs with a barrage of death threats and harassment which continue to this day. No comment so far from the Trump campaign or its lawyers. But Newsmax says claims made Mr. Krebs are a threat to free speech, and his legal action endangers all media organizations that seek open discourse of ideas and news. 
 Joining me now is the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at DHS, Christopher Krebs. 
 So, Chris, thanks for being here, first of all. Good to have you back. 
KREBS: Thanks for having me, Katy. 
TUR: I want to start a little bit more forward-looking. 
 YouTube announced today that since Safe Harbor date has passed, they're going to start taking down videos on their site that claim that the election is rigged or claim that there was fraud or claim that somebody else won. 
 How much do you think that's going to do to curb the spread of disinformation? And do you think, you know, Twitter, Facebook, et cetera should be doing the same? 
KREBS: So, again, thanks for having me on, Katy. Good to see you again. 
 I think the step by YouTube was a sensible, thought-out change in their - in their policy that really tied it to an independent point in time, and that's really, as you pointed out, the Safe Harbor deadline where you've got more than 200 (ph) - 
TUR: I think he just froze, so we're going to work on getting Chris back up to talk to us about that and a bunch of other things in a moment. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be back in just a moment hopefully with these issues fixed. 
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
TUR: Back with me - back with me now is former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at DHS, Christopher Krebs. 
 So, Krebs, we could make the joke that we were just hacked, but the reality is we just had some technical issues. And luckily for you, you didn't freeze in a really uncomfortable and weird position, 
 (LAUGHTER) 
TUR: So, kudos on that. Let's go back to that - let's go back to that first question. 
 YouTube has taken steps to remove content. Do you want to see Twitter and Facebook, which have such an incredible reach, do the same? 
KREBS: Well, you know, to the - to your point about getting hacked, it's funny how claims like that do kind of pop up when you see disruptions when, you know, it's -- more often than not, it's a technology challenge more than anything. 
 So, I think - I think to your point about some of the other social media platforms, they've I think through the election done a good job of flagging information, providing information panels, tying back to authoritative sources of information. 
 I do think that now that we are passed the Safe Harbor date and particularly with next weeks - December 14 seating of the Electoral College, you know, the race has been over. The race has been over for quite some time. 
 I think these ongoing claims of rigged elections and, you know, fraud without any supporting evidence, that at least courts have found compelling or convincing, it needs -- it's time to move on. It's time to get ready for transition with President-elect Biden. 
TUR: I'm sure you heard about this, but the head of the DHS committee in the Senate, Ron Johnson, is calling a hearing where he is going to investigate election - I'm sorry - irregularities in the 2020 election. My mouth has clearly just been hacked. Saying the only way to quell suspicion is to investigate. 
 Do you have any thoughts about a sitting senator, namely Ron Johnson, using the Senate floor or the Senate hearing room to undermine the confidence in democracy? 
KREBS: So, I worked quite closely with Chairman Johnson and the Homeland Security Committee. That was my primary committee of oversight when I was the Director of CISA and back in that role. And so, you know, I'm not quite sure what information he may have. I guess we'll find out next week. 
 But I do think that - and I believe he mentioned in his statement as well, that probably the best course of action here or the avenue or forum for these sorts of investigations is the court of law, and we've seen courts across the country, you know, dispensed with any of these regulatory claims -- so maybe he's got something else, and would look forward to seeing that. 
 I do think, though, that with the Safe Harbor deadline, with the seating in the Electoral College next week, you know, from a legal recourse perspective, we're just about passed any sort of point of changing the outcome here. 
 Again, it is clear that President-elect Biden will be taking the oath of office on January 20. 
TUR: I want to get to what's been happening with you personally. But first, I want to look at what we are facing in the coming weeks, months ahead. Vaccine distribution is going to really critical and sensitive. Hospitals are at a critical point as well. 
 Should we be concerned about any hackers looking to disrupt the vaccine distribution or hospital care, specifically when it comes to ransomware, which a lot of hospitals have had to deal with? 
KREBS: So, this is something that we have actually been thinking about for quite some time. Historically, particularly over the last three or four years, the healthcare sector had been one of the most targeted from criminal gangs, cyber-criminal gangs, and ransomware actors. 
 And we had put together a plan on -- in fact, March 15, I remember sitting down and writing up the plan and passing it over to the team -- that would reach out and provide a cybersecurity umbrella effectively over patient care services over the vaccine and therapeutic development organizations and the PPE manufacturers, because we really could not afford any sort of disruption in patient care. 
 Think about New York. Think about Brooklyn back in April and May when every ICU bed was critical. You lose a hospital, and you have to start denying patient care, and people can die. And so, that's going to continue to be a priority going forward with the added complexity of the logistics piece and the distribution, the fill and finish of the vaccine, and getting it out there until it's the shot in the arm. 
 There's a lot more to do there, and it's going to require the government. We heard about Governor Perna - or General Perna rather a little bit earlier. The team at CISA, the private sector, everybody's going to have to be on board in defending all these different systems, and I am particularly concerned about ransomware actors in the coming months. 
TUR: You're suing the Trump campaign and Joe diGenova for the way that they have defamed you, according to the suit. Any consideration to suing the president of the United States who has been doing the same? 
KREBS: Well look, the defendant, diGenova, is part of the campaign, speaking on behalf of the campaign when he made those remarks that were, you know, clearly a - you know, and accusation that I was a traitor and that I deserved the punishment of a traitor. So, that is just something that I'm not going to stand for despite whatever consequence or costs that come to me, not going to stand for that sort of attack on me, on my family. 
 But for a larger point, what we're seeing is a coordinated effort to intimidate Republicans from speaking up and accepting the outcome. Look at what's happening down in Georgia with the governor, the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state. 
 Look at what's happening with Governor Ducey out in Arizona. And there's just an intimidation campaign, and I'm not going to stand for it. And I think that this in part can show that, you know, others that need to speak up in the future can do so. 
TUR: You know, you've said that you can't un-ring the bell when it comes to death threats, the stuff that diGenova was saying, but the bell has been ringing since Trump got onto the political scene. He's inspired death threats against journalists as far back as 2015 a least, death threats against his opponents, his fellow Republicans, health officials, judges, families of fallen heroes, regular, nonpublic Americans. 
 White Supremacists have been emboldened since he came into office. Hate crimes have surged. There was a 16-year high for the FBI in 2019. He teargassed peaceful protestors to take a picture with a Bible in front of a church. The Republican Party has enabled this because they've benefited politically from him, and they're still doing that. 
 Now that you are one of his targets, what is your take on your party? You're a Republican. Do you have any regrets about being a part of this administration, even though you were working to gird what is the most important part of our democracy, which are free and fair elections? 
KREBS: I have zero regrets about serving in - as the director of CISA. I think we built something enduring that will sustain, not just this administration, but far into the future. We did everything right. I would do it a thousand times over. I couldn't be more proud of that team and my time there. 
 But yes. I spoke up. I defended the Constitution. I put country over party, and I suffered the consequences, and I'm still suffering the consequences on a daily, hourly basis. 
 I'd do it over again, though, and I - you know, I don't know why others aren't. I suspect based on my experience in part they are - they don't want to be put in this position, but there's also the political implications and the political suicide, as I've heard some say, by coming to speak up. And it's just -- it's time to get passed this. This has to stop. Everyone - you know, Republicans need to stand up for the country. 
TUR: Chris Krebs, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it. Sorry about that hiccup in the beginning, but glad we were able to get you back up. 
KREBS: Resilience, Katy. Thanks so much. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
TUR: Thank you. See you soon.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Casten of Illinois). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of our Special Order tonight. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California? There was no objection. [[Page H5751]] Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the chair of our Congressional Black Caucus. I thank Chairwoman Bass, who has helped us organize this tonight, for her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus. I join with my colleagues to speak on the impact of COVID-19, the pandemic which has had an especially disparate impact on communities of color. First, again, let me thank Chairwoman Bass, Chairwoman Chu, and Congressman Castro of the Tri-Caucus, as well as Representatives Kelly, Haaland, and Davids, for working together to ensure that we address the disproportionate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities of color--also, Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia. It is really very imperative that our strategy to crush COVID intentionally includes provisions to support the specific needs of our communities. I also want to take a moment to thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Pallone for negotiating some of the provisions of our COVID Community Care Act, that is H.R 8192, in our Heroes bill, which further strengthens efforts to engage medically underserved communities in the latest version, again, of the Heroes bill. I thank Chairman Scott and, of course, our subcommittee chair, Rosa DeLauro, for their support, their input, and their assistance in getting this bill, the COVID Community Care Act, really very targeted, very focused, and something that all of us could support as a Tri- Caucus, also--and, of course, Speaker Pelosi, again, for her steadfast understanding and support for this issue. Now, millions of people have suffered incomprehensible grief and hardship due to the COVID pandemic. Just in the United States, we now have over 10.3 million cases of COVID-19 and over 240,000 deaths. That is mind-boggling. We are here today to insist that any coronavirus response addresses the needs of people of color. This is because the impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have had a disproportionate impact on African Americans, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian Pacific Islander, and immigrant communities. We have witnessed the horrific result of how longstanding inequities stemming from structural racism has exacerbated COVID's threats to people of color. Black people are dying at more than twice the rate of White people in the United States. Indigenous and Latinx people are both 50 percent more likely to die from COVID than White Americans. Between January and July, the AAPI death rate rose 35 percent compared to an increase of 9 percent for White Americans. The Federal Government must address the vicious cycle of disparities that drive these unequal impacts on communities of color, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. That is why we introduced, together, H.R 8192, the COVID Community Care Act, legislation to ensure that any effort to fight the pandemic engages local communities as partners in crushing the virus. This bill, supported by our Tri-Caucus colleagues, ensures that any testing and tracing efforts engage communities of color where they live with trusted messengers who speak their language and know their unique challenges. Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Pallone worked with us to add language to Chairman Pallone's $75 billion CONTACT plan. This is included in the revised version of the Heroes Act passed October 1, which will further strengthen efforts to engage communities of color. The strengthened CONTACT plan mandates that community-based organizations and nonprofits in medically underserved communities play an important role to reach those communities that public health agencies have difficulty engaging. It ensures the people hired to conduct the outreach have experience and relationships with people living in the communities that they serve. Turning a blind eye to the American people's desperate need for culturally rooted contact tracing and testing will result in increased deaths and illnesses that we could have prevented. We must build a relief package that addresses the needs of millions, especially Black and Brown people, who are suffering disproportionately from this virus. Mr. Speaker, we thank our Speaker for her persistence, leadership, and fighting spirit to ensure that lawmakers acknowledge and respond to the racial and ethnic disparities that have plagued our Nation for centuries. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), who played an important role in making sure that the Latinx community and all the Hispanic issues, as it relates to COVID, were included as a part of this bill. Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lee and the caucuses involved for putting this Special Order together. Today in America, there is not one State that has the pandemic under control. My own State of Texas became the first State to surpass 1 million cases. Let me repeat that: 1 million cases. These cases represent many of our neighbors, our friends, and our own family. I personally have self-quarantined once and have already been tested four times for different times I have been exposed to someone with the virus. Thank God all tests have come back positive--I am sorry, negative. I meant to say, ``not come back positive.'' Little misspeaking there. Mr. Speaker, this pandemic is affecting everyone, but it is not affecting everyone in the same way. Black and Latino communities are bearing the weight of this pandemic. While Black and Latino people are being hospitalized and dying at higher rates than White people, they are also the ones most likely to be working jobs that put them more at risk. They have always been essential workers. Now more than ever, this is sadly more true. They are meatpacking workers, farmworkers, sanitation workers, custodians, restaurant workers, grocery clerks, postal workers, police officers, firefighters, longshoremen. These aren't jobs you can do from home. If you don't show up, you just don't get paid. Black and Latino families have had to go into work even when it meant they may get sick. And many of them have gotten sick. Even worse, many infected a loved one with the virus. America depends on these workers to put food on our tables and keep us safe. Because our leaders didn't take any steps to prepare us for this pandemic, we can't even offer the protective gear needed to keep essential frontline workers safe. So while we are asking these communities to go to work every day without the proper protections, we also know that Latino and Black Americans are more likely to have health conditions, like asthma and diabetes, that make the virus even more dangerous. Nationwide, Latinos make up 55 percent of the COVID cases and 24 percent of the overall deaths. Yet, we are only 18.5 percent of the total U.S population. In Texas, Latinos are about 40 percent of the population, but we are nearly 55 percent of the deaths--more than half, Mr. Speaker. In Houston, sadly, Latinos account for 54 percent of the deaths caused by this virus--again, more than half. My district, which is nearly 80 percent Latino, was one of the hardest hit areas in the Houston region. But despite these numbers, many of my constituents are still scared of getting tested or even seeing the doctor. Many don't have health insurance. Others don't trust our healthcare system. Many more are undocumented and fear deportation. Mr. Speaker, now, I am optimistic about the future, given some of the news about vaccine trials. However, we must make sure, once we have a safe and effective vaccine, that it is distributed fairly and equitably and that no one is left behind. We do not need to repeat the disparate mistakes of the past. As elected officials, we must work together to keep all of our constituents safe. Right now, with the virus rapidly spreading, we are losing precious time if we don't act. People will get sick, and even more people will die, if we wait any longer. Legislation like the Heroes Act provides protections that working families and frontline workers need now. It would provide rent relief for families who are afraid of losing their homes. It would help our schools keep kids healthy and safe for in-person learning. [[Page H5752]] It would give local and State governments much-needed relief to retain frontline workers on payroll. It would give hardworking families another stimulus check. It would also reinstate the supplemental weekly $600 in unemployment benefits, a lifeline that helped many families stay afloat. Lastly, we need to earn the trust of these communities and let them know that, yes, they are a part of us. People of color know and must know that we are working for them. We cannot save the economy if we don't save people first. Saving many lives must be our top priority. It will take all of us to crush this virus, but I know that we will get together to make sure that we are all working together to get past this pandemic, and if we do, it will be for all of us. Todos juntos. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for this Special Order. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Garcia very much for her input in helping to write the COVID Community Care Act. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), my good friend, the chair of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies of the House Appropriations Committee. Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me this evening and being here with other colleagues because we know, and we have said over and over again, that we face public health and economic crises unlike any that our country has seen in a generation. More than 245,000 Americans have died of COVID-19. Tens of millions are out of work. And we know how communities of color have suffered acutely and disproportionately. While we have known about some of these issues in the past, about the inequities in our healthcare system, in our economy, this virus has exposed and shone a light on the depths of the injustices and inequities that exist for communities of color. While we need to fight the virus, we need to fight the virus of injustice. In my home State of Connecticut, as of last Thursday, Black people accounted for more than 14.5 percent of Connecticut's COVID-related deaths when they are just 12 percent of the population. Mr. Speaker, 18 percent of COVID cases are Hispanic, outpacing the 17 percent they make up of our State's population. Yet, this data is not perfect, which is why I have been so proud to work with my friend and my colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, to require the Health and Human Services agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide Congress with the data on which communities are bearing the worst impacts so that we can make sure that testing--once we have an administration that takes testing strategy seriously--is focused on those communities and that they get the resources they need going forward. My colleague from California, Congresswoman Lee, has been indefatigable in questioning the issue of the data that we have on communities of color, and she did this long before we probably could spell ``coronavirus.'' To be frank, it is frustrating that we even had to put this requirement into law. The CDC is complying with the reporting, but we keep a vigilant eye on that information. We have more work to do to ensure that we have complete data. Through November 12, 47 percent of cases had unknown race and ethnicity in the CDC's surveillance system. That is just not good enough. This moment demands the boldest possible efforts to secure affordable healthcare, to address the deep racial disparities exposed by this virus, to help families. I am proud to chair this subcommittee, which has been central to our response to this pandemic and the disparities that it has exposed. Together, my colleagues on the committee and on this subcommittee, we have appropriated $280 billion in emergency funding for education, for health, for working people throughout the pandemic. Through the good offices of my colleagues, Congresswoman Lee and Congresswoman Bass, we inserted language that would focus on the issue of disparities and how we address them. We could add $400 million in the latest iteration of The Heroes Act. {time} 2030 Yet the United States Senate has refused to do anything to help struggling Americans and get us to a place where we can test everyone, that we can do contact tracing, and that we can provide treatment. We know more is needed. So, as I mentioned, the House has passed two additional relief packages, and we looked at boosting SNAP benefits by 15 percent; expanding access to paid leave and paid sick days; and expanding and improving the child tax credit for one-third of our children, which includes half of Black and Hispanic children, who are currently left behind because their families earn too little. If we do not address the virus, we will not be able to do anything about turning our economy around. Let me say a thank-you to Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who has been a tireless champion for communities of color, for organizing this Special Order. She and I, along with others, are committed to bringing to bear the full weight of the Federal Government for the communities of color, not only in my district, but around the country, because together we can and we must do better. People's lives are depending on it. We know what we need to do to save lives. It is incomprehensible that we can't get to a protocol which allows us to save people's lives and those in communities of color, which are affected the most. Ms. LEE of California. Thank you, Chairwoman DeLauro, for your statement and for reminding us that we have to address the health and economic impacts at the same time. One does not supersede the other. Thank you for helping us move our COVID Community Care Act forward with your leadership on the subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, someone who contributed to crafting our COVID Community Care Act but also whom I have had the pleasure to serve with as co-chair of the Healthcare Task Force for CAPAC, a true leader on so many issues. Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I am here to say that we have reached another terrible milestone. Just yesterday, the number of COVID-19 cases in our country surpassed 11 million. One million of those cases came in just the last week alone. The coronavirus is spreading at a rapid rate, and while hospitals and healthcare providers in all 50 States are overwhelmed, there is still no plan to contain it. The failure to contain the coronavirus has let it spread within every State and community. Almost one-third of Americans know someone who has died from COVID- 19, and yet we are still hearing false claims, including from some of my colleagues on the other side of this Chamber, that masks don't work and that gathering in large groups indoors is safe. The message that we can or should live with this virus is a denial of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are sick or who have died from this virus already, and it is condemning thousands more to die as well. But not everyone is impacted equally. While all of us are susceptible to the virus, communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by the Trump administration's inaction. Now that we know more about this virus, we can see who is paying more for it. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have seen cases surge in their communities and continue to face some of the highest COVID-19 infection and mortality rates out of any of the racial groups in several States, including in my own State of California. And new data shows that Asian Americans are also dying from COVID-19 at a disproportionate rate, with deaths in the Asian-American community nationwide increasing by 35 percent this year compared with the average over the last 5 years. This is compared to a 9 percent increase in deaths for White Americans. For other communities of color, there are equally high rates: for [[Page H5753]] Blacks, a 31 percent increase compared to 5 years ago; 44 percent for Hispanics; and a 22 percent increase for Native Americans. Downplaying this virus is also downplaying the reality of healthcare inequality and minority health disparities in this country. That is why we crafted an urgently needed COVID-19 response bill: to make us sure we can combat the disproportionate effects of coronavirus on communities of color. That is precisely what the House did in May, with the passage of The Heroes Act, and again in October, with the updated Heroes Act, which ensured that we collect disaggregated race and ethnicity data related to COVID-19 and that we restore Medicaid coverage for citizens of the Freely Associated States of the Pacific islands and include provisions like Congressmember Barbara Lee's COVID-19 Community Care Act. It is so important because it would provide targeted COVID-19 testing, treatment, and contact tracing for communities of color that have been devastated by the pandemic. What is so crucial is that it would include culturally and linguistically competent outreach for contact tracing that is so critical to the AAPI community. Communities of color cannot wait any longer. Americans cannot wait any longer. We need the outgoing President and Republicans in Congress to stop playing games with American lives. We can't ignore the fact that Americans are dying and the economy is struggling because of a refusal to take this virus seriously. It is time to face facts and work together to pass a coronavirus relief package now. Ms. LEE of California. Thank you very much, Chairwoman Chu, and thank you for being with us tonight, but also for your consistently sounding the alarm to all of us about the necessity for culturally and linguistically appropriate services, testing, contact tracing, as well as the importance of disaggregating the data based on race and ethnicity. Thank you for input into helping to write this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), who is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus' Health Braintrust, someone who is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and also a member of the Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on National Security and Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. Congresswoman Robin Kelly has helped put together this bill and helped make sure that we put provisions in for data collection and all of the information that we know we need to be able to target these resources. So thank you, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for being here tonight and for helping us. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to challenge this Congress to act to end the shocking health disparities that COVID-19 has put on display. To date, nearly 250,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID-19 and more than 10 million have been infected. And these numbers are still rising. Shocking, but not surprisingly, a disproportionate number, as you have heard, of those who fought and those who fought and lost battles with COVID-19 have been people of color. Once again, another public health crisis has taken an oversized toll on Black Americans, Latinx Americans, Asian and Pacific Americans, and Native Americans. COVID-19 is simply the latest in a long list of diseases, including cancer, addiction, HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and on and on and on, with a disproportionate impact on communities of color. Why does this continue to be the case in America, the greatest, richest, most powerful country in the history of our world? The answer is simple: health disparities. In America, despite all of our technology and pledges to equity, the ZIP Code in which you are born is nearly inescapable as a determinant of your life, your health, and, yes, even your death. In Chicago, part of my district, life expectancy varies up to 30 years by neighborhood. The pattern is the same across most American communities. But what are the social determinants of health, or, as I like to say, the social determinants of life? In short, they are all of the nonmedical factors that impact your health, the things you don't necessarily see a doctor for, such as not having ample fresh food and vegetables in your diet because there aren't any grocery stores in your community; missing routine preventive care, such as cancer screenings, because seeing the doctor means getting up at 4 a.m , taking two buses, and missing a day of work or school. It means worrying about manganese or lead poisoning in the air you breathe, the water you drink, or the playground where your child plays. It means dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression from housing instability on top of a recession and pandemic. All of these factors decide our lives, our health, and, tragically, again, our death. So many of these factors are out of one's individual control, including environmental factors, the location of medical facilities, discriminatory housing policy, and discrimination and so forth. We all know these factors have been with us for a long time. They have been undermining our health and the health of generations of Americans for centuries. As we work on these issues, I am continuously reminded of a quote from Dr. King: ``Of all of the forms of inequality, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.'' Despite 70 years passing and amazing technological and societal advancement since he spoke these words, injustice in healthcare, of all of the forms of inequality, still remains the most shocking and inhumane. Right now, we are seeing parallel COVID-19 pandemics: one in wealthier, whiter communities, and a much harsher one in vulnerable communities of color. But this is America. There shouldn't be a two-tiered system, because when it comes to public health, we are all in this together. The only solution is to root out health disparities at their source. We must end systemic racism and a lack of opportunities for low-income and minority communities. To address these issues in healthcare, my colleague and mentor, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, has introduced the COVID Community Care Act, H.R 8192. This legislation, which I am proud to support and my office helped develop, will provide grants for community-based organizations and nonprofits to conduct testing, tracing, and outreach activities in communities. Given the number and rates of COVID-19, we know that these resources are most urgently needed in communities of color. I believe this legislation is central to making health equity a cornerstone of our Nation's immediate pandemic response. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important and immediate-acting legislation. Additionally, I have introduced the Ending Health Disparities During COVID-19 Act, H.R 8200, which provides a sweeping approach to addressing the widening health disparities from COVID-19. It tackles the immediate-term needs of testing, tracing, and public awareness from COVID-19. But just as crucially, the bill makes long-term investments to build a stronger system to reduce and eliminate health inequities in the future via investments in the social determinants of health, technology, research, workforce diversity, and community health centers and workers. Lastly, H.R 8200 makes our government accountable for progress on health equity by creating a Federal task force with oversight over health disparities during COVID-19 and beyond and protects the Office of Minority Health. That is a long list to do, but it is all desperately needed. I truly feel that this long-term approach, combined with strict accountability for health disparities, is exactly what this moment calls for. For the first time, many Americans are waking up to the reality faced by communities of color, a reality that the Tri-Caucus and our fellow Members of Congress, such as champions like Representative Barbara Lee, are working to address. We need to harness this rightful outrage and catalyze it into action. We need to make this the last pandemic to have a disproportionate impact on any [[Page H5754]] American community, because the fact is Americans deserve a public health system that works for all Americans. We deserve to live in one America, not an unequal America with worse health outcomes for Black and Brown people. We all deserve healthcare because healthcare is a human right, yet it is not easily won. It must be fought for. As Frederick Douglass taught us: ``Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.'' The only path forward is for us to demand it. {time} 2045 We demand action to end health disparities once and for all. We must do this by passing the COVID Community Care Act, H.R 8192; and Ending Health Disparities during the COVID-19 Act, H.R 8200. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly for laying out actually what the social determinants of healthcare are. Oftentimes, we see that as separate from healthcare, but you laid it out perfectly, so thank you for educating us tonight. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, but also is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Native American Caucus. I know Congresswoman Jackson Lee's district in Texas is ravaged by this COVID pandemic, so I want to thank her for helping us with our COVID Community Care Act and for being here tonight. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much the distinguished manager, the honorable Barbara Lee. I am most grateful for her yielding to me. Also, let me acknowledge the very important work that she has done over the years in disparities and racial equity. I thank her for being my partner in H.R 40, and me her partner in H. Res. 100, that really also speaks to the pain and the issues of disparities. We look forward to reconciliation and we look forward to repair with those two initiatives. Let me also acknowledge the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for gathering us all together, and my colleagues that are here, and my colleague that has just joined us, Congresswoman Adams. Let me try to address where we are nationwide and how disparities weaves its way into this phenomenon of the transfer of power--the peaceful transfer of power--and how the President's status of the President-elect and Vice President-elect is interwoven in how to best respond to one of the disparities in healthcare, and that is COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, first to take note of the fact that the stability of the United States electoral system is remarkable, it first involved the election of 1800, which marked the first time in United States history that power was transferred. The second was the 1876 election, which the President was chosen, who won neither the absolute majority popular vote nor the necessary electoral votes, but it was resolved by the infamous Hayes-Tilden Compromise. The third instance involved the 2000 election, which sought the Supreme Court effectively deciding the Presidency. But in each of those moments there was an end. In each of those moments there was a transfer of power. We find ourselves now in a quandary. Believe it or not, there are people who are on ventilators. There are people in El Paso and Dallas who are in hospitals, who are being negatively impacted by the idea of the lack of peaceful engagement, specifically because the President- elect and Vice President-elect definitively need to be able to secure information to have their COVID-19 task force speak with the White House task force to understand prospectively how vaccines will be transferred or implemented throughout the Nation. So as people are languishing on hospital beds, as loved ones are saying goodbye over telephones, we have this inability to transfer power. Our history has shown the transfer of power in the Nation. It was designed as a benefit. It can be harmed when the transition is not smooth and transparent, which can be invariably attributed to one or more of the following reasons. The outgoing President is still engaged in the building of his or her legacy in the final months of the administration; two, there are sharp differences in philosophy or style between the outgoing and incoming administration; or the current or future President actively makes trouble for his or her successor. In this timeframe, I hope my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, will find a way, as we come back to Washington, to be able to look to the transition of Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, for example, and speak to the idea of how this should go; or maybe even from Lyndon Baines Johnson and Richard Nixon, opposite parties, but yet they found a way to come together in the wake of the importance of the Constitution and democracy. Why would I start a health disparities discussion on the transfer of power? As I indicated, it is very important for the work that is going to be part of containing COVID-19 to really start now, to really start now with a new attitude about wearing masks, socially distance, washing your hands, and yes, testing, testing, testing. That is what I have found as a chair of the bipartisan Congressional COVID Task Force where we have been working on doing the work of implementing and talking about the diagnostic testing and all its gradations over the past couple of months. Our first testing site in Houston was opened on March 19. We have opened 41 test sites. The most recent was this past Saturday. We open the 42nd on this coming Saturday. The question in disparities is very, very real. The pandemics dealing with racial disparities indicates that there are 74 Black or African-American persons out of 100,000 impacted by COVID; Alaska Native and American Indian, 40; Hispanic or Latino, 40; Asian, 31; White, 30; Native Hawaiian, 29; others, 29. We can see that there are large numbers of African Americans, Hispanic, and American Indian. We just heard that the Navajo community will be shutting down for a period of time. That is how devastating COVID-19 is. That is how much the disparities in healthcare are evident. Let me share with you this question of disparities and underlying conditions. Those are numbers of the number of deaths. So the number of deaths is much higher among African Americans and Hispanics. Why? Thirty percent more likely to die of CVD--that is cardiovascular disease--that is Black Americans. Latin Americans, 40 percent more likely to die from stroke. And then it goes on. Two times as likely to die as an infant, two times more likely to die of asthma, three times more likely to develop ESRD, two times more likely to die from prostate cancer, two times on cervical cancer, three times in pregnancy. There is still a high level of maternal mortality among African Americans. As it relates to Latin Americans and Hispanics, two times more likely to die of liver cancer, two times more likely to die of asthma, 1.7 more times to have diabetes, and two times more likely to die of HIV- AIDS. Which is why we see this increasing number of those on that ethnic backgrounds, African Americans, Hispanics and, of course, Native Americans and Alaskans, because of the underlying conditions and the lack of access to healthcare. We are on this floor today because, as members of the Tri-Caucus, we have made it our constructive business, starting from the Affordable Care Act, to deal with the question of health disparities. As a Member of Congress many years back, I authored legislation to create an Office of Health Disparities in the Health and Human Services Department, knowing that there was a lack of recognition of different clinicals that African Americans were not participating in, men and women. Hispanic men and women were not participating in those as well. In the course of the work that we are doing right now, we are seeing a high number of deaths. Texas hit 1 million cases on November 6. We were the first State to hit 1 million cases. Now, in Dallas and El Paso, my sister cities, my colleagues who are there working very hard, our hospitals are being oversaturated. The same thing that happened to Houston, Texas, in July of 2020. And so it is crucial to do three things: One, we must pass the Heroes [[Page H5755]] Act. We are desperate for that money in testing, desperate for PPPs, desperate for PPEs. We are now running out of PPEs in some of these saturated towns. We are desperate, as I said, for testing. We are desperate for economic dollars that are needed. Every testing site that I have had--most of them, let me clarify that, we have had full distribution by our Houston Food Bank, because people need food. And as evidenced with lines in my sister State, just a day or two ago in Los Angeles, we saw cars and cars and cars of individuals recognizing that testing was crucial. I believe that we cannot ignore anymore. There must be cooperation with our Republican friends, I will call them, to deal with providing this financial relief to our cities and to all of our constituents who are desperately in need. We must acknowledge the health disparities. It is important both in the White House task force, we know that it is happening in the COVID task force under the President-elect and Vice President-elect, that health disparities can kill. And we can see that the lack of a transition of power right at this time, the continued denial of who has been the victor, so that the General Services Administration can stop violating the administrative procedure code in not allowing the resources necessary for the team that is now in place looking to transition to power with the existing Presidency being stopped, not by law, not by any determination that you did not meet the standard of victory in terms of the Electoral College, but by an individual administrator who indicates that they refuse to certify and to allow that transfer of funds for them to work on. So I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to present today, to speak both on the disparities and the needs for response, but also on the devastating impact of COVID-19 impacting now several States. Mr. Speaker, I want to close on this. I want to say it to America. We are coming on our holidays, and many different faiths celebrate their holidays during this time, from Thanksgiving to, in the Christian faith, Christmas, but many different faiths. I am not here to judge how and which faith will be celebrating this very special time of the year. We beg of you, on the basis of science, to realize that because someone is your family member does not mean that they are immune or that they cannot transfer COVID to you, or they are not asymptomatic. My message is that we must test, test, test. Today, I had a press conference in Houston, and I want to read these words as I close. I would encourage all cities and States to follow what was utilized in Los Angeles. It was effective. And that is a public safety alert. A public safety alert that is simple, that goes out to the text of all citizens. COVID-19 cases are increasing. Please wear a mask and social distance. Get tested if you have symptoms or might have been exposed. I would add to that, get tested because you may be asymptomatic. That simple note to the text of people in that State allowed thousands of individuals to see the importance of getting tested, and they went to the testing sites. That is going to help contain and stop the community spread. So my message is, as you get into Thanksgiving, please do your events outside. If you are inside, doing them 10 or less. Please ask all of your relatives and loved ones to get tested, tested, tested, so that we can contain this preceding the vaccine, which we know is coming, but is not coming as soon as we would like. We also know that we will be addressing the question of implementation and distribution as it relates to people of color and those who suffer disparities, along with the elderly and those underlying conditions. You will not get a vaccine tomorrow. While we are waiting for that process, we need to do what is right. And that is to continue to social distance, wearing the mask and getting tested. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her kindness and her leadership. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to join my colleagues during this Special Order to shed light on the impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. I want to recognize and thank Congresswoman Karen Bass and the Congressional Black Caucus for hosting this hour, so that we may not only speak about the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on communities of color but also call upon the federal government to address these devastating inequities. Mr. Speaker, before addressing the devastating impact of the COVID-19 crisis on communities of color, I wish to speak briefly on the important subject of presidential transitions and the peaceful transfer of power for which the United States is justly celebrated around the world. The stability of the United States electoral system is remarkable, but this does not mean it has never been tested; it has--three times-- and weathered each crisis. The first involved the election of 1800, which marked the first time in United States history that power had transferred peacefully between political parties. The second involved the 1876 election, in which a president was chosen who won neither the absolute majority popular vote nor the necessary number of electoral votes and was resolved by the infamous `Hayes-Tilden Compromise,' which effectively ended Reconstruction. The third instance involved the 2000 election which saw the Supreme Court effectively decide the presidency by ordering the cessation of ballot counting in the state of Florida. Mr. Speaker, what enabled the country to weather these crises is that all parties, including the victor and the vanquished, understood and accepted the primacy of the rule of law and the bedrock democratic value that power is only legitimately conveyed by the people through their votes and is held in trust and to be used exclusively to protect and advance the national interest. A peaceful transfer of power implies also a smooth and seamless transition from outgoing administration to the incoming one, which has usually but not always been the case. Our history has shown how the transfer of power, and the nation it was designed to benefit, can be harmed when the transition is not smooth and transparent, which can invariably be attributed to one or more of the following reasons: (1) the outgoing president is still engaged in the business of building his or her legacy in the final months of the administration; (2) there are sharp differences in philosophy or style between the outgoing and incoming administrations; or (3) the current or future president actively makes trouble for his successor or predecessor. The transition between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the newly elected John F. Kennedy is an example of the dangers of presidential legacy building post-election because Eisenhower authorized covert programs for regime change in what is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the Dominican Republic, and, most famously, against Fidel Castro's Cuba but none of these programs were completed by the time Kennedy took the oath of office. The second form of trouble can come from the soon-to-be-powerful people on the receiving end of a transition, as when incoming President George W. Bush failed to pay due heed to the warnings received from then President Bill Clinton about the dangers of Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. But far the most serious harm to be avoided stems from the failure of the outgoing administration to prioritize and expedite the sharing of vital information and resources with the incoming administration. This is the danger we currently face in the aftermath of President- elect Biden's resounding victory in the Electoral College and the popular vote. Mr. Speaker, the federal government is perhaps the most complex organization in the world because it involves a $5 trillion-plus budget, four million person workforce, including the military and reservists, who are stationed all over the globe, and two million career civil servants in hundreds of operating units of the Executive Branch, not to mention the 4,000 political appointments made by the President. So, a presidential transition of this enterprise is a massive operation that requires a lot of work, time, and cooperation in three important areas. The first is access to the agencies themselves--there are over 100 operating in the government--and the incoming team needs to understand what's happening inside them because each and every one of them have different urgent issues that they are addressing and deciding, including for example, the approval and distribution of any vaccine for COVID-19 and dealing with the economic damage caused by the pandemic. The second area is the processing of personnel, 1,200 of whom require Senate confirmation and who will need security clearances and financial agreements with the Office of Government Ethics to make sure there are no conflicts. Third, the incoming President must have access to the President's Daily Brief, to ensure it has awareness and understanding of the most current threats and challenges facing our nation. [[Page H5756]] The final area is providing funding needed to pay the salaries and expenses of the incoming administration's transition personnel. I call upon the current President to honor his oath of office to defend, protect, and preserve the Constitution and America's sacred tradition of peaceful transfers of power and begin the full and seamless transition to the Biden Administration. Turning to the immediate subject at hand, we must recognize the impact of COVID-19 on people of color and its devastating consequences on the communities we represent. As a Founding Member of the Bipartisan Congressional Coronavirus Task Force, I call upon my fellow Members of Congress to not only recognize the disproportionate impact of this virus on communities of color but also to come together to redress this reality. I first saw news reports on the rapid spread of the coronavirus in early January. As the numbers of infected increased, I knew this was not something to be taken lightly, so I began to monitor the situation more closely. On February 10, 2020, I held the first press conference on the issue of the novel coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Airport, where I was joined by public health officials, local unions, and advocates to raise awareness regarding the virus, the implications it might have for travel to the United States from China, and the need to combat early signs of discrimination targeting Asian businesses in the United States. From the onset of this pandemic, I have actively worked to address the negative and unequal affects of this disease on people of color. I have facilitated the opening of 41 COVID-19 testing sites, which have collectively provided over 200,000 tests to residents in Harris County, one of the most diverse counties in the state of Texas. Across the United States, Black individuals comprise thirteen percent of the population. Yet, we experience a higher rate of incarceration and health disparities, are more vulnerable to economic slowdowns, and are even more likely to get COVID-19 and face significantly worse health outcomes from the disease. Disparities tell the story of living while Black in America, and there are disparities in every aspect of African American life and death. Right now, Black people are dying at 2.2 times the rate and Latinx people at two times the rate of white people. Whereas American Indian and Alaska Native people are 5.3 times more likely than white people to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. My district of Harris County has reported over 175,000 total cases of coronavirus, of which over 17,300 identify as Black and over 37,700 identify as Hispanic or Latinx. From a high prevalence of preexisting conditions to limited employment opportunities to additional structural inequities that are the result of implicit bias and racial discrimination, there are several factors at play for why communities of color are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, For example, the African American community is known to be highly affected by preexisting conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, lung disease, and obesity. With these underlying health conditions, many African Americans suffer from an impaired immune system, thereby dramatically increasing the risk of being infected with and the fatality of the coronavirus. Limited employment opportunities also play a role in understanding why people of color are most affected by this disease. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Black workers make up about one in nine workers overall, but they represent about one in six front-line-industry workers, further increasing the disproportionate likelihood of being exposed to and contracting the virus. These disparities cannot be separated from the history of enslavement of Black people and subsequent periods of segregation, racialized violence, pervasive racial discrimination and their ongoing impacts. With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to support my bill, H.R 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African- Americans Act, as it is the most comprehensive legislative solution to begin repairing the legacy of systemic racism and accounting for the harms of past and present. Mr. Speaker, it is abundantly clear that people across the United States are struggling in the face of this epidemic. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to our constituents to address this vicious cycle of socioeconomic disparities that further the inequities facing communities of color, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. We must come together to ensure that COVID-19 relief extends to all members of our communities. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for using this opportunity to deliver a very powerful public health message also. I also would just note a personal privilege. I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, and my heart goes out to all of those who are suffering from this terrible deadly pandemic. Mr. Speaker, I want to salute our colleague, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, for being such a tremendous leader in El Paso in trying to help on the ground with taking care of people and preventing the transition of the virus. I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee again. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), a member of the Committee on Education and Labor, whose mission in life, I think, is to make sure that our young people are educated and receive the best quality education through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and at the same time make sure that their health and safety is a top priority issue for their health and their safety. {time} 2100 Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership. I thank, as well, the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus for getting us together tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the founder and co-chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. I want to take this time to speak briefly about the impact of COVID- 19 on the Black community, communities of color, and pregnant women. For the past 8 months, our country has been battling this incredibly deadly virus. It is a national public health crisis unlike any we have experienced. And it has highlighted the existing racial health disparities that our communities were already facing. The data does not lie. We know that people of color are experiencing significantly higher rates of infections and deaths compared to White individuals. Black people are more than twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as White people, and the mortality rate for Native Americans is nearly two times that of White persons. Researchers have also found that Black and Hispanic people are nearly three times as likely to contract COVID-19 and nearly two times as likely to die from COVID-19. This month, a CDC morbidity and mortality weekly report found that pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Since January 22, more than 38,000 pregnant women have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States, of which 51 have died. The study found that pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, receive invasive ventilation, and are at increased risk of death compared to White, nonpregnant women. But much remains unknown. But what we do know is that before the pandemic Black and Brown mothers were already dying at alarming and unacceptable rates. In particular, Black women from all walks of life were three and four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than White women. According to the CDC data, Latina women account for nearly 50 percent of COVID-19 cases among pregnant women. And these numbers indicate the devastating effects of the pandemic on the minority community. A recent study also showed that Black and Latina women in Philadelphia who are pregnant were five times more likely to be exposed to the new coronavirus than White pregnant women. Physicians in Washington, DC, said that anecdotally they were also seeing similar patterns, according to an August report in the Washington Post. As Congresswoman Lee and I have continued to say since the start of the pandemic, we are facing a crisis within a crisis. And that is why I have been working closely with healthcare providers, stakeholders, to provide a comprehensive plan for eliminating these racial health disparities, especially during the pandemic. We must improve access to screening and treatment for women at risk for preterm birth; [[Page H5757]] Ensure that all women have access to high quality maternity care, no matter where they live; And provide access to midwives or doulas that can advocate for families' needs throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery. This summer I introduced the COVID-19 Bias and Anti-Racism Training Act to provide grants for hospitals and healthcare providers for implicit bias training, particularly in light of COVID-19. We all have our unconscious bias, and it is important for our healthcare providers to be more aware of those issues as they are providing care to patients during the pandemic. We need to invest in programs that help families meet their basic needs, including nutrition assistance, housing assistance, and other social supports. Last, but certainly not least, we must improve the quality of the data being collected and ensure diversity among stakeholders that serve on mortality review committees. If we don't stand together to address these inequities, Black and Brown mothers, our families, our friends, and our communities will continue to suffer. I hope this Congress will stand together to ensure that our communities, our mothers, our babies have the resources they need--not only to survive this pandemic, but to thrive and truly build back stronger. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for her leadership. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Alma Adams for that very clear statement and I thank her for outlining the interconnection and the intersection between systemic racism and the social determinants of healthcare and how they impact the underlying conditions and exacerbate it now as seen in COVID-19. I thank Congresswoman Adams again for her leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), who certainly knows the serious and devastating impact of this COVID pandemic in her district. I visited her district and understand how close she is to her nonprofits and her community-based organizations who are doing phenomenal work. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Scanlon very much for being here. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for arranging this Special Order hour. I stand before you today frustrated by the lack of Federal relief as COVID-19 surges across the country. With each day that we don't have relief for families, businesses, our frontline workers, and the State and local governments that have borne the brunt of the pandemic response, its impact grows that much more disastrous--and disproportionately so for our communities of color. More than a quarter of my constituents are Black, and we now know that Black individuals are almost three times as likely to become infected with COVID-19 as White individuals and twice as likely to die of the virus. So over the past 9 months my district has seen families and neighborhoods devastated by this virus. My district is also home to our Nation's poorest and hungriest major city. When you live paycheck to paycheck, one missed shift or even missing an hour's worth of work forces families to make impossible decisions between putting food on the table or keeping a roof overhead, and it makes quarantining impossible. For the most part these are not new challenges caused by COVID-19, these are challenges that have been plaguing our most marginalized communities and communities of color for decades. But the pandemic has exacerbated and laid bare these inequities for all who care enough to see. It is why we must provide relief to help our communities survive the pandemic and commit to closing the gaps preexisting the pandemic that have been holding families back for far too long. Our families are in crisis. They need stimulus checks to pay their rent and mortgages. They need access to free testing to protect themselves and their families. They also need food and childcare and access to equitable education, housing, healthcare, and wages. This pandemic has shown us there is a roadmap to improving the lives of millions of Americans, especially our communities of color, but we must have the courage to follow it. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Scanlon for joining us tonight with our Tri-Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus, because so many of the issues that you are talking about in your district as it relates to COVID and health disparities and the social determinants we all are dealing with in our districts, and so thank you for your leadership and for continuing to help us get this Heroes Act passed so that we can do some of the things that you laid out that our communities deserve. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following statements from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Indian Health Board, the Asian Health Services, and UnidosUS. Statement for the Record: Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights On behalf of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, I submit this testimony for the record. No matter what we look like, where we live, or what is in our wallets, getting sick reminds us that at our core we are all the same. But we cannot ignore the pandemic's disproportionate and devastating impact on Black and Brown people, Native Americans, low-income people, people with disabilities, the elderly, women, and immigrant communities. Through health and education disparities, income inequality, discrimination in voting and housing, unequal treatment within the legal system, and the digital divide, communities of color have been routinely locked out and left behind--and sadly, as we have seen in increased hate violence and in far worse health outcomes for people of color, this pandemic is no different. This pandemic calls for the enactment of policies and sufficient funding to protect low- and moderate-income people from economic disaster and to meet the urgent needs of the most vulnerable people in our nation. Communities that have already been marginalized by structural barriers to equal opportunities and who have low levels of wealth are particularly vulnerable during this current emergency. While many working people have been sidelined, many others are still providing essential services during the crisis--working at our grocery stores, delivering mail and packages, and providing care to vulnerable people--putting their lives at risk, often at reduced hours and wages, to keep our country running. The ongoing crisis has laid bare the structural racism and barriers to opportunity that are entrenched in our society, and our collective actions now must not worsen them. Statement for the Record: National Indian Health Board On behalf of the National Indian Health Board (NIHB) and the 574 sovereign Tribal Nations we serve, I submit this testimony for the record. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribal communities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. No sector of Tribal economies or health systems have been spared from the devastation this crisis has unleashed. We are now, as of this writing, seven months in the throes of an unparalleled pandemic. While we may not have been able to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, we absolutely could have mitigated the worst of its impacts--especially in Indian Country. But unfortunately, our Tribes are, once again, battling a catastrophic, unprecedented, once-in-a- lifetime disease without the necessary federal relief funds and resources to protect and preserve life. Since June of this year alone, NIHB has submitted seventeen letters to Congress urging immediate action and passage of emergency stimulus funds for the Indian health system to better respond to COVID-19. We solemnly await congressional action. We have consistently urged long-term reauthorization of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI), vital to Tribal efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by preventing, treating, and managing one of the strongest risk factors for a more serious COVID-19 illness: type II diabetes. We solemnly await congressional action. We have demanded that Congress work to fulfill Treaty obligations to Tribal Nations and Native people by ensuring congressional COVID-19 relief funds are on par with the recommendations outlined by Tribal leaders and health experts. We solemnly await congressional action. We have urged that burdensome administrative requirements for accessing federal grants and programs be eliminated to ensure expeditious delivery of relief resources. We solemnly await congressional action. We have urged that Congress not subject the Indian health system to a destabilizing continuing resolution (CR) as it continues to combat against an unparalleled pandemic; or to, at the least, attach emergency COVID-19 appropriations for IHS to the CR to mitigate the pain and disruption. Again, we solemnly await congressional action. To be clear, we continue to appreciate the commitment and leadership of members of Congress in working to advance Tribal health priorities in response to COVID-19. But the Tribes require action from all of Congress on those commitments. On September 10, NIHB was joined by the National [[Page H5758]] Congress of American Indians and the National Council of Urban Indian Health in a letter to congressional leadership urging immediate action on the priorities listed below. These priorities have remained intact since early summer, as Indian Country continues to bear the brunt of this extraordinary crisis. In short, these priorities have not changed because the situation in Indian Country remains just as dire. Once again, we solemnly await congressional action. Tribal COVID-19 Priorities Minimum $2 billion in emergency funds to IHS for immediate distribution to I/T/U system. $1.7 billion to replenish lost 3rd party reimbursements across the I/T/U system. Prioritize equitable distribution of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine across Indian Country, including a minimum 5 percent set-aside in vaccine funds for the I/T/U system. Minimum $1 billion for water and sanitation systems across IHS and Tribal communities. Long-term reauthorization (5 years), higher funding, and expansion of self-determination and self-governance for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians. COVID-19 Updates The last time NIHB appeared before this Subcommittee was June 10, 2020. Since that time, the number of AI/AN COVID-19 case infections reported by IHS have nearly quadrupled. Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a roughly 22 percent increase in COVID-19 hospitalization rates among AI/ANs--increasing from a rate of 272 per 100,000 in mid-July to 347.7 per 100,000 as of September 12, 2020. Rates of death from COVID-19 among AI/ANs have more than doubled since the last time NIHB testified before the Subcommittee--from a rate of 36 per 100,000 on June 9 to 81.9 per 100,000 as of September 15. In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that across 23 states, cumulative incidence rates of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/ANs are 3.5 times higher than for non-Hispanic Whites. Also, according to CDC, age-adjusted rates of COVID-19 hospitalization among AI/ ANs from March 1, 2020, through August 22, 2020, were 4.7 times higher than for non-Hispanic Whites. Without sufficient additional congressional relief sent directly to I/T/U systems, these shocking upward trends will more than likely continue as COVID-19 restrictions are eased, schools and businesses reopen, and the potential threat of a more severe flu season coincides with this pandemic. State-specific data further demonstrate the vast inequities in COVID-19 deaths between AI/ANs and the general population. Below are a few examples of these state-specific disparities based on NIHB's analysis of state-specific data. In Arizona, AI/ANs account for 5.5 percent of the population, but 13.4 percent of COVID-19 deaths. In New Mexico, AI/ANs account for 10.7 percent of the population, but nearly 57 percent of COVID-19 deaths. In Montana, AI/ANs account for 8.2 percent of the population, but 27 percent of COVID-19 deaths. In South Dakota, AI/ANs account for 10.4 percent of the population, but nearly 23 percent of COVID-19 deaths. In North Dakota, AI/ANs account for 6.5 percent of the population, but 13.3 percent of COVID-19 deaths. In Mississippi, AI/ANs account for less than 1 percent of the population, but 3 percent of COVID-19 deaths. Even more alarming is the lack of complete data on COVID-19 outcomes among AI/ANs. Available COVID-19 data already highlight significant disparities between AI/ANs and the general population; shockingly, true estimates of disease burden and death resulting from COVID-19 in Indian Country are likely much higher. In CDC's own August 2020 report on COVID-19 in Indian Country, the authors noted the following: This analysis represents an underestimate of the actual COVID-19 incidence among AI/AN persons for several reasons. Reporting of detailed case data to CDC by states is known to be incomplete; therefore, this analysis was restricted to 23 states with more complete reporting of race and ethnicity. As a result, the analysis included only one half of reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/AN persons nationwide, and the examined states represent approximately one third of the national AI/AN population. In addition, AI/ AN persons are commonly misclassified as non-AI/AN races and ethnicities in epidemiologic and administrative data sets, leading to an underestimation of AI/AN morbidity and mortality. Indeed, there are multiple states that still have a significant percentage of COVID-19 cases missing critical demographic data. In California for instance, a whopping 31 percent of cases are still missing race and ethnicity. The State of New York has failed to report AI/AN data altogether--listing only Hispanic, Black, White, Asian, or Other on their COVID-19 data dashboards. Meanwhile, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI)--instrumental for COVID-19 response efforts in Indian Country because it is focused on prevention, treatment, and management of diabetes, one of the most significant risk factors for a more serious COVID-19 illness--has endured four short-term extensions since last September, placing immense and undue strain on program operations. Under the House- passed CR for FY 2021 H.R 8337, SDPI is extended for a mere eleven days--its shortest reauthorization on record. A national survey of SDPI grantees conducted by NIHB found that nearly 1 in 5 Tribal SDPI grantees reported employee furloughs, including for healthcare providers, with 81 percent of SDPI furloughs directly linked to the economic impacts of COVID-19 in Tribal communities. Roughly 1 in 4 programs have reported delaying essential purchases of medical equipment to treat and monitor diabetes due to funding uncertainty, and nearly half of all programs are experiencing or anticipating cutbacks in the availability of diabetes program services--all under the backdrop of a pandemic that continues to overwhelm the Indian health system. Now, with the inevitability of a continuing resolution (CR) through at least December 11, 2020--and the possibility of another CR thereafter--it is even more imperative that Congress provide emergency appropriations to better stabilize the Indian health system. This Subcommittee knows full well that IHS is the only federal healthcare system that is subject to government shutdowns and CRs. This Subcommittee is also acutely aware of the devastating impacts that endless CRs have had, and will continue to have, on the Indian health system. We commend Chair McCollum's leadership in introducing H.R 1128 and Ranking Member Joyce's strong support for H.R 1135--both of which would authorize advance appropriations for IHS and permanently insulate it from the volatility of the annual appropriations process. But in the interim, Congress must ensure a funding fix that protects and preserves life in Indian Country and delivers critical pandemic relief in recognition of federal Treaty obligations. If Congress fails to provide sufficient emergency appropriations for the Indian health system, a stopgap measure will force a healthcare system serving roughly 2.6 million AI/ANs to operate during a pandemic without an enacted budget or even adjustments for rising medical and non-medical inflation. In short, that is a recipe for even more disaster, death, and despair. We patiently remind you that federal Treaty obligations for healthcare to Tribal Nations and AI/AN Peoples exist in perpetuity and must be fully honored, especially in light of the current pandemic and its unparalleled toll in Indian Country. While we appreciate the roughly $1 billion to IHS under the CARES Act and the $750 million testing set-aside under the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act; these investments have been necessary but woefully insufficient to stem the tide of the pandemic in Tribal communities. We thank you for your continued commitment to Indian Country, and as always, stand ready to work with you in a bipartisan fashion to advance the health of all AI/AN people. Sincerely, National Indian Health Board. Statement for the Record: Asian Health Services On behalf of the One Nation Commission, Co-Chairs Sherry Hirota, CEO of Asian Health Services, and former Congressman Mike Honda, I submit this testimony for the record. The information shared, is documented in the One Nation Commission 2020 Report: One Nation AAPIs Rising to Fight Dual Pandemics COVID-19 and Racism, which was delivered to every member of Congress and the Senate in October 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit communities of color, including AAPIs, the hardest. In the 13th Congressional District, Alameda County in California, AAPIs are the largest population subgroup, comprising a diverse and varied population, spanning every economic stratum; essential workers and corporate CEOs, Nobel Laureates and students on the broken side of the digital divide, researchers and doctors, janitors and food servers, and new immigrants all contributing to society in this time of crisis. By the time COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic and national emergency, the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Community had already gone underground. Fear of the virus was compounded by a sudden and virulent rise in hate and violence against Asians. Racist taunting by our country's top leader calling Covid-19 ``Kung Flu,'' and ``China Virus,'' used the pandemic and its economic destruction to scapegoat Asian Americans across the country. Congresswoman Lee's own staffer was called, ``COVID'' and pelted with rocks while riding his bike through Rock Creek Park in D.C Despite calls from every sector of the AAPI Community for the president to retract his dangerous words, the hate speak continued. The result was a tsunami of attacks on Asian Americans. As COVID-19 cases spiked around the country, AAPIs were not only blamed but appeared missing from the news coverage, data, and charts. The twenty-five-year-old health advocacy battle to ``disaggregate data'' reared its ugly head again and was now a matter of life and death. Lumping together information about ethnic and language groups obstructs effective epidemiology and care. In the big picture, the absence of data ensures invisibility for AAPIs as a whole, and each subpopulation within that designation. Missing are the number of AAPIs who have been tested, how many tested positive, how many are sick, or hospitalized, or have died. We must expand the frame--to ask, what is the impact of COVID-19 on AAPI communities? To fill the gap a self- organized [[Page H5759]] work group of nationally renowned AAPI researchers pulled data from multiple cities and states revealing higher death rates among Asian Americans who were Covid positive. Nine months into the dual pandemic of COVID-19 and racism, the AAPI community is fighting back against being both blamed and ignored. The One Nation Commission is honored to join forces with Congresswoman Barbara Lee, Congresswoman Karen Bass, and the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Asian Pacific Islander American Caucus, and individuals and organizations to defeat COVID-19, bring back our communities stronger and healthier, combat hate crimes against AAPIs, and work in solidarity with the Black, Latinx and Indigenous People to fight systemic racism. Hidden disparities undermine effective and just health policy and outcomes. COVID vaccine allocation, for example, based prioritization in part on inaccurate information of disparities and vulnerabilities. Recently the National Academy of Sciences released recommendations on vaccine allocation but did not name Asian Americans as a vulnerable group. This must be immediately rectified. Critical to health, justice, equity, and the opportunity for our communities to emerge stronger than before from these dual pandemics: (1) Mandate disaggregated data collection and reporting; (2) Require linguistically and culturally competent outreach and care; (3) Strengthen and resource the community health center and nonprofit safety net; and (4) Reverse unfair and un-American anti-immigrant policies that endanger the public health and public good, including Public Charge. Immediate next steps: (1) Protecting and further investing in trusted community- based organizations to implement new programs and preserve proven programs, COVID community testing, COVID contact tracing, Cultural and linguistic competency, Addressing misinformation that creates fear and chilling effects (e.g , public charge rule change). (2) Expanding beyond COVID-19 outcomes (cases and deaths) to understand full impacts Anti-Asian hate crimes a physical and mental health, Mental health, Immigration status affecting access and utilization of services (e.g , public charge rule change), Other social determinants of health (occupation/essential workers, living conditions, language barriers). (3) Data disaggregation is paramount to identifying and addressing hidden disparities. Encourage immediate disaggregated data collection at the local levels--testing, cases, comorbidities, deaths, Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good: Reinforce disaggregated data reporting in public communications to create this paradigm shift, even with small numbers, An example of hidden disparities: Filipinos having even more striking death rates. In the U.S , Filipino nurses make up 4 percent of workforce but nearly 31.5 percent of deaths among registered nurses. Statement for the Record: UnidosUS On behalf of UnidosUS, I submit this testimony for the record. Communities of color are putting life and limb on the line every day to help our nation through the COVID-19 crisis yet continue to be overwhelmingly and disproportionately impacted by the dire health and economic repercussions of this pandemic. These unprecedented and devastating times continue to expose the appalling and deeply unjust fault lines in our nation's health care system and labor force. Despite the fact that Latinos are overrepresented in ``essential'' occupations where they are most at risk of exposure to the coronavirus infection and are also bearing the brunt of the economic fallout from the pandemic, they have been consistently excluded from much needed COVID-19 relief legislation. Any further delay in COVID-19 relief legislation will be particularly devastating to the health and well-being of our nation's 58 million Latinos, far too many of whom have been left out of the four coronavirus relief packages enacted so far. Failure to respond urgently to the human suffering we are witnessing is deeply objectionable and, from a public health and economic perspective, wholly indefensible. Latinos have long suffered from health disparities--being more likely to develop chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Another disparity is emerging, Latinos are contracting and dying from COVID-19 disproportionately and are nearly three times more likely to die compared to non-Hispanic Whites. These disparities are a result of multiple preexisting structural and societal factors, including a health care system that leaves coverage out of reach of millions of Latinos. Before the pandemic, more than 10 million Latinos (including 1.6 million Latino children) were uninsured, and preliminary data now show that the Latino uninsured rate increased over the course of 2020. Latinos have also long struggled with food insecurity and increased stressors and mental health issues, and the pandemic has only exacerbated these challenges. Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to thank all of our colleagues who joined us this evening laying out the pandemic upon pandemic upon pandemic in communities of color. In all past public health crises one recurring lesson stands out: That is, success depends on the willingness of people to trust the health information that they are getting. We learned this from the HIV and AIDS pandemic, Ebola, H1N1, and now we are learning it again during COVID. So this is especially true for communities of color. This year millions of Americans have taken to the streets to demand racial justice. This is because the system that exists today has failed them. We must acknowledge the centuries old racial and ethnic disparities, and intentionally build culturally and community-minded policies to move forward for a stronger and unified country. We must act swiftly. The longer communities suffer from COVID-19, the greater the long-term impact and disparities. States project that their shortfall for 2021-fiscal year will be much deeper than the shortfalls faced in any year of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve economists project that unemployment will be at 6.5 percent at the end of 2021. Of course, it is higher in communities of color. The Congressional Budget Office projects an even higher rate at 6.7 percent; again, for communities of color more than likely it is double that. Our Nation's workforce is disproportionately composed of communities of color and some of the most marginalized communities and groups. Many are essential workers. These workers and their families are being put at greater risk during the coronavirus pandemic due to the conditions of their jobs and their socioeconomic realities and, mind you, the lack of Federal response. We must pass a COVID relief bill. I am proud to stand before you joined by my colleagues because I know that this change is on the horizon. From the sidewalks to the ballot boxes, people are fully engaged and are courageously advocating to be heard. It is our job that every community is ensured coronavirus relief and that we negotiate what is needed, including funding to provide relief for every community and with community stakeholders. Our bill, H.R 8192, the COVID Community Care Act, does just that. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind. Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank our Speaker; Chairwoman Bass, for sharing this CBC Special Order hour; and I thank our Tri-Caucus chairs, Congresswoman Chu and Representative Castro, Representatives Haaland, Davids, of course, Representative Garcia. And I thank all of our colleagues for being here tonight to really sound the alarm. This is an emergency in the entire country. It is a deep and broad emergency pandemic as it relates to COVID-19, and we need relief right away. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on our communities of color across this nation. This virus has deeply impacted every segment of our society, but the harms that have befallen certain populations have been disproportionate and devastating. For our Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian, and immigrant families, COVID-19 has exacerbated longstanding inequities in our health care and economic systems, and our communities of color have been burdened with higher rates of comorbidities, more barriers in accessing medical care, and worse health outcomes due to this virus. This has been devastating to observe, as many of these same communities have also been dealing with significant economic turmoil in these recent months. Never has our society faced a challenge such as this. These are truly unprecedented times, and it merits our relentless efforts to lessen the damages of this pandemic, which is expected to worsen during this upcoming winter season. It is our responsibility as members of this chamber to prevent the imminent disparate harms of COVID-19 on communities of color. We must also address the systematic issues of structural racism in our society, which affects the health and economic wellbeing of our families. Everyday, our nation sees the need for further action to combat this public [[Page H5760]] health crisis. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting additional federal assistance to fight this pandemic and protecting our communities of color. Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Tri-Caucus' Special Order to highlight the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. Our nation is currently overwhelmed by unprecedented numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. After more than eight months of suffering, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage our communities, creating incalculable pain, massive economic disruption, and immense strain on our public health system. As of this moment, more than 246,000 Americans have lost their lives from this deadly disease. More than eleven million have been infected, and nearly 70,000 are currently hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19. While all Americans are suffering from this pandemic, communities of color are experiencing acute and disproportionate pain. From the beginning of this pandemic, it was clear that the phrase ``when white America catches a cold, Black America gets pneumonia'' would be particularly true with COVID-19's devastating consequences. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately harms Black and Brown communities with dramatically unequal infection rates, hospitalizations, and deaths. Specifically, Black people are three times more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than whites. Moreover, Black people die from COVID-19 at around twice the rate of white people. These aren't just statistics. They represent our friends, neighbors, and loved ones. They are people like my cousin who died from COVID-19 earlier this year, and so many others who are no longer with us. Like past disease outbreaks and natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic lays bare the consequences of systemic injustices suffered by communities of color. Institutional racism, compounded by environmental and economic injustices, have resulted in severe health disparities for communities of color which make the COVID-19 pandemic so uniquely devastating. Despite the disproportionate harm the COVID-19 pandemic has caused among communities of color, many states still do not provide transparency regarding racial and ethnic demographic data for COVID-19 cases and deaths. For example, in my state of Indiana, the State only provides an aggregate breakdown of the racial and ethnic demographics for cases and deaths during the entire pandemic. This results in a profoundly incomplete picture of the disproportionate sickness, death, fear and tragedy this virus is inflicting on communities of color. As Congress considers much-needed, additional measures to combat COVID-19 and provide relief for businesses, hospitals and workers, one thing is clear: Communities of color must receive substantial relief and support that matches the devastation they've suffered from this pandemic. In addition, states and public health departments must provide updated and daily demographic information, including a racial and ethnic breakdown, for the daily numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. This data transparency is essential to fully understand how the pandemic is affecting different communities and how we can best respond. With this data, we can better target our COVID-19 relief funds and support to ensure that communities of color get all the help we need to weather the storm of this pandemic and combat the underlying inequities in our health care system that this pandemic has exacerbated. I am committed to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to act now and to act boldly to implement a national plan that will save lives from this terrible disease."

 Anita Fine 
Formerly of New Kensington 
Anita Fine, social worker and activist, died at home in Ithaca, N.Y., Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020. Anita was born and grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., but lived the majority of her life in New Kensington. She attended Lincoln High School, graduated from Oberlin College, and earned a master's degree in social work from Columbia University. After marrying Dr. Daniel Fine in New York, they moved to western Pennsylvania, embarking on a special 61-year union in which they partnered as health care providers at a clinic for mine workers, raised three children, and collaborated on many social justice causes. Anita worked at the Miners Clinic in New Kensington for more than 30 years, where she headed the social work program and later served as the clinic administrator. In these roles, she developed a counseling practice in social work, educational programs about illness, and a training program for home health aides that was the first to be implemented in the region. Throughout her life, Anita organized and participated in a variety of social justice causes, including antiwar movements, civil rights, and equal opportunity for women. In the 1960s and 70s, Anita and her husband advised a local youth group that opposed the Vietnam War, organized bus trips to protests in Washington, D.C., and co-founded the Alle-Kiski Peace Center to support antiwar activities. Anita travelled worldwide to support the work of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, lobbied elected officials, and practiced civil disobedience at nuclear test sites in Nevada to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. She organized friends and family to actively challenge racial segregation at local swimming pools in the 1960s, participated in the local chapter of the NAACP, organized the Alle-Kiski Neighbors Against Hate to oppose local race-based hate crimes, and served as a board member of the Pittsburgh ACLU. Anita was a founding member of the greater Pittsburgh area chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) and fought for equal rights and opportunities for women in her work and the local community. Anita was devoted to her extended family and deeply valued her relationships with friends. She was warm, kind, engaging, intelligent, a great listener, and had a wonderful sense of humor. Summers always included outdoor time in the woods with family and friends, conversing, swimming, picnicking, and enjoying nature walks. Anita loved to sing folk songs and enjoyed swing dancing to big band music. She was a skilled ping-pong player and could command an audience punching a speed bag. Anita was predeceased by her husband, Daniel. She is survived by three children, Michael (Kathryn) Fine, David Fine (Jane Piecuch) and Susannah Fine (Greg Shaw); six grandchildren, Danielle, Jacob, Max, Emma, Jonah, and Talia; and one great-grandchild, Isaac. Memorial services will be private. In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation in her memory to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) at https://www.aclu.org/, the Thomas Merton Center (https://www.thomasmertoncenter.org/), or a local community food bank.

Genevieve J. Musial, 87, formerly of West Leechburg, died Friday, Aug. 28, 2020, at her assisted living facility in Tampa, Fla. Born July 10, 1933, in Hyde Park, Jennie was a longtime resident of the Alle-Kiski Valley. She graduated from Leechburg High School, Class of 1951. Jennie always enjoyed reminiscing about her days as a majorette and playing violin in the high school orchestra. She loved helping to organize her class reunions and looked forward to seeing her classmates at every event. Jennie loved to sing and dance, and did so well into her 80's. She loved big band and polka music. She loved dancing to live bands with the Dick Taddy Orchestra, the Ravotti Quintet and the Johnny Murphy Band, among her favorites. Partners in crime at numerous dancing adventures included lifelong friends, Lori Z., Alda K., Rich M., Marie A. and others. Another highlight and fond memory in Jennie's life was the trip to Europe she took as a chaperone with the American Youth Chorus and Symphony, visiting Germany, Austria, Italy and Switzerland, while her daughter played clarinet in the symphony. Jennie was a parishioner at St. Martha's Roman Catholic Church, now a part of Christ the King, where she was an avid member of the choir, along with fellow singers, Jim P. and Kathy R. She was also an enthusiastic salesperson for the church's biannual bake sale, taking in orders for nut and poppy seed rolls by the hundreds. Jennie was also a devoted Pittsburgh sports fan, beginning with her love of the Pirates, then the Steelers, and finally becoming a devotee of the Penguins as well. She marveled that Pittsburgh was the only city whose professional sports teams all wore the same colors, beloved black and gold. Mrs. Musial was predeceased by her husband, Henry T. Musial; her parents, Anthony and Anna Fondrk Sulava; and good friend and longtime companion, Edward J. Ambrose. Mrs. Musial is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Annette and Thomas DiFiore, of Tampa, Fla.; grandchildren, Max DiFiore and Isabel DiFiore; sister and brother-in-law, Sylvia and Ronald Ravotti; and numerous nieces and nephews whom she loved very much. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a memorial service will be planned at a later date. "

[*]GRAHAM: Good morning, everybody. I think we have Senator Blumenthal remotely. Is that correct? 
BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Is it okay, Senator Blumenthal, if we move forward? 
BLUMENTHAL: Absolutely. Thanks very much. 
GRAHAM: Okay, I'll make a brief opening statement. And this is about censorship, suppression and the 2020 election, sort of a deep dive when it comes to Twitter and Facebook about the platforms and the decisions they make, how they make them, can we do better? Do we need to do better? 
So the first thing I want to talk about here is health risk associated with social media. A 2018 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 750 13- to 17-year-olds found that 45 percent are online almost constantly, and 97 percent use social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat. So why are we having this hearing? The products that these two companies offer, people like and they use. So the bottom line is, they've probably been more successful than their wildest dreams, and they're having to make decisions that offend people on the left and the right, and what we're trying to do is look at section 230 and to see if it needs to be modified or changed because section 230 basically allows social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to pass on information without legal liability. 
If a newspaper does something you don't like, you think they've slandered you in a certain way, you can sue them. If a news program does something that you think is out of line, even as a politician with a high bar, you can sue them. These companies have liability protection when it comes to the content that their users engage in. You can sue the person who gave the tweet, but you can't sue Twitter who gave that person access to the world in terms of what they said. And we've got to find a way to make sure that when Twitter and Facebook make a decision about what's reliable and what's not, what to keep up and what to take down, that there is transparency in the system. And I think section 230 has to be changed because we can't get there from here without change. 
But in 2019, a study of more than 6,500 12- to 15-year-olds in the U.S. found that those that spent more than three hours a day using social media might be at heightened risk for mental health problems. Another study, 12,000 13 to 16-year-olds in England found that using social media more than three times a day predicated poor mental health--predicted poor mental health and well-being in teens. Other studies also have observed links between high levels of social media use, depression or anxiety. The average millennial checks their phone 157 times daily. I don't know how members of the Senate, I don't know where we fall. 
Social media is designed to sustain users' attention with a mix of good user interface design and psychology, creating an addictive mix for users. It's called the slot machine effect, a technique which utilizes a pull to refresh and scrolling mechanisms on newsfeeds similar to a slot machine. The like button, a feature to provide social validation through a positive feedback loop by measuring and comparing the number of likes a user's content obtains. 
Gamifying social interactions, employing gamification to engage users and keep them coming back. For example, streaks is the one causing the most concern and using elongating redlines to display the number of days since two users interacted. Guess what these technologies do is try to keep us engaged. The more we engage the technology, the more advertising benefit to the company. Is that a good business practice? Maybe so. Does it create a health hazard over time? Something to look at. 
Now the other aspect of this debate is are these companies newspapers? Are they TV stations? Do they have the power of media organizations that have rules and regulations and the current media platforms do not? There are rules about what a television station can do. There are rules about what a newspaper can do. And what I want to try to find out is if you're not a newspaper at Twitter or Facebook, then why do you have editorial control over the New York Post? 
They decided--and maybe for a good reason; I don't know--that the New York Post articles about Hunter Biden needed to be flagged, excluded from distribution or made hard to find. That to me seems like you're the ultimate editor. The editorial decision at the New York Post to run the story was overridden by Twitter and Facebook in different fashions to prevent its dissemination. Now if that's not making an editorial decision, I don't know what would be. It's one thing when we do it in our private lives. Nikki Haley made a post about her concerns about mail-in balloting. It was flagged as something--a claim, this hasn't been legitimized. Let me read it to you. 
The next question to ask is why is it a crime to raise doubts about the Holocaust? Why should anyone who writes about such doubts be imprisoned while insulting the Prophet is allowed? Now that's the Ayatollah. He's opining that raising doubts about the Holocaust shouldn't be a crime, and he is openly called for the destruction of Israel, his regime has, and his tweet was basically allowed to flourish. Here's what Nikki Haley said. Despite what the media tells us, election fraud does happen, and policies like balloting harvesting and mailing ballots to people who don't request them makes it easier--makes that easier. That needs to stop. This claim about election fraud is disputed. 
Well, that's her opinion. She believes, like I do, that mail-in balloting is ripe for fraud if you can't verify the signature and if we just send mail ballots out to the world that are not requested, and you don't have a signature verification system that can be trusted, you have in fact led to harvesting of ballots for nefarious purposes. The question for us as a country, at what point do the decisions by these organizations cross a line? At what point do they have to assume responsibility that section 230 shields them from? 
And to the people who are about to testify, I consider your products to have changed the world, mostly for the good. We're able to interact among ourselves. We're able to talk to each other and share life experiences. We're able to in real-time communicate to our neighbors and our friends and those who oppose us what we think with technology that just makes it instantaneous and can literally light up the world. 
Section 230 was developed to allow these technologies to flourish. Early on, if you could sue Twitter or Facebook for content on a Facebook posting or a tweet, and they were liable for what somebody else said or what they felt or did, then the company would have probably never been in existence. The companies are trying to help us deal with child pornography. We have the EARN IT Act that to be able to maintain liability protections when it comes to sexual exploitation of media sites, social media sites by sexual predators, this committee has passed a bill saying you can only maintain that liability protection if, in fact, you use best business practices. 
And that's where I think we need to be going. 
[*]GRAHAM: My hope is that we change section 230 to incentivize social media platforms to come up with standards that are transparent and opaque, that will allow us to make judgments about their judgments, that the fact checkers be known, that the community standards, who sets them, what are their biases, and give some direction to these companies because they have almost an impossible task. They're literally trying to engage in telling us what's reliable and what's not based on cable news commentary or tweets from politicians for average citizens. 
Nobody in a free society has ever had that responsibility before, and the question is how do you control that responsibility. I don't want the government to take over the job of telling America what tweets are legitimate and what are not. I don't want the government deciding what content to take up and put down. I think we're all in that category. But when you have companies that have the power of governments, have far more power than traditional media outlets, something has to give. 
And I'm hoping in this hearing today that we can find a baseline of agreement that section 230 needs to be changed, that my bias would be to allow the industry itself to develop best business practices to protect the sites against terrorism and child exploitation and other concerns, that we look at the business practices of these companies through a help prism that some of their practices need to be modified because it can become addictive. 
You know, we thought tobacco was a good thing for a long time to the point that we send it to our soldiers in combat. The more we realized about the addictive nature of tobacco, the more we changed our mind about telling the public about the product. So, whether or not we do that with social media platforms, that these platforms can be addictive if used too often, I don't know if we need to go there. But I do know that section 230, as it exists today, has got to give. 
And I think there's Republican and Democrat concern about the power that's being used by social media outlets to tell us what we can see and what we can't, what's true and what's not, to the extent that section 230, in my view, has to be rewritten. So, that's the purpose of this hearing, is to find a way forward to bring about change. And when it comes to social media platforms and section 230, change is going to come. 
With that, Senator Blumenthal? 
BLUMENTHAL: Thank you very, very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for having this hearing today. And I look forward to cooperating with you not only in this hearing but in the upcoming Congress on our EARN IT bill, and other measures because you're absolutely right. Change must come to social media. 
The fact is we meet today in an unprecedented and precarious moment in American history. Daily, the president shocked our conscience and shakes the very foundations of our democracy using a powerful megaphone, social media. The president has used this megaphone to spread vicious falsehoods in an apparent attempt overturn the will of voters. 
Every day he posts new threats and conspiracy theories about mail-in ballots and voting machines, lies that contradict his own election security officials and his lawyers. He uses this megaphone potentially to block a peaceful transition of power. 
Now, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey, you have built terrifying tools of persuasion and muniple--manipulation with power far exceeding the robber barons of the last Gilded Age. You have profited usually by strip mining data about our private lives and promoting hate speech and voter suppression. You have an immense civic and moral responsibility to ensure these instruments of influence do not irreparably harm our country. 
I recognize the steps, they're really baby steps, that you've taken so far. The destructive incendiary misinformation is still a scourge on both your platforms and on others. In fact, Google has been given a pass from today's hearing. It's been rewarded by this committee for its timidity, doing even less than you have done to live up to its responsibilities. 
The recent actions you have taken, in fact, are simply to check the truth of what appears on platforms. Often it is voter suppression and incendiary malicious misinformation, and you've tried to slow its insidious spread. That's not censorship. That's moral and civic responsibility. 
Now, I believe, and I hope the chairman agrees, that a series of hearings on big tech is long-overdue on antitrust issues, on privacy concerns, and section 230. I have urged, in fact, a breakup of tech giants because they've misused their bigness and power, breaking off, for example, WhatsApp and Instagram, rigorous privacy protection because consumers should have control over their own data and, indeed, section 230 reform, meaningful reform, including even possible repeal in large part because their immunity is way too broad and victims of their harms deserve a day in court. 
But this hearing is certainly not the serious proceeding that we need. It may become a political sideshow, a public tar and feathering. My colleagues seem to want to ignore the foreign disinformation campaigns intended to interfere in our democracy, and calls for murder of FBI Director Wray and Dr. Fauci. We--what we've seen here are fighting words and hate speech that certainly deserve no free expression protection. 
The fact is that the purpose of today's hearing seems as much to bully or browbeat you, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey, from taking even more responsible action by threatening cuts to section 230. Censorship is really a misnomer for this hearing. 
What you've done is to label and to fact check to avoid amplifying misinformation and to, in effect, impose those labels to alert people that what they are consuming may misinform them. And Facebook took down ads for Biden in Michigan and the ACLU in Colorado for mistaken information about voting. In short, there was action that affected both sides. 
I have fought for section 230 reform for 16 years from my time as Connecticut's attorney general when I took on the scourge of registered sex offenders grooming children on Facebook and MySpace. With Senator Portman, I have led passage of the only successful revision so far to section 230, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, known as SESTA. And Chairman Graham and I have authored the only bill to reform Section 230 that has actually moved out of--out of a committee. The section--the EARN IT Act pass this committee unanimously. 
Change is going to come, no question. Change is on the way, and I intend to bring aggressive and targeted reform to section 230. But I am not, nor should we be on this committee, interested in being a member of the speech police. There are real harms and real victims here. And in some ways, this hearing is a betrayal of those real harms and the real victims of them. Those harms have been caused by big tech because you have failed your responsibility, as have others in this industry. 
I want to see real reform that will enable these abuses to be reformed, because your platforms have embraced abuse and weaponized child predators, violent white supremacists, and human traffickers. And I've heard heart-wrenching stories from the victims. 
[*]BLUMENTHAL: You've set back civil rights protections for Muslim Americans who live in fear of armed militias organized by white--by private online groups. You have set back consumers in competition, making that kind of antitrust action very, very important. The American public deserves and demands real reform and accountability, national consumer privacy rules, antitrust principles that curb predatory power and reforms as section 230 that shut--that stopped shutting the courthouse door to victims. I look forward to an opportunity for real change, and I think you can meet this moment by putting your power and your money on the right side of history. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Well, thank you. A lot to unpack there. Senator Blumenthal has been great to work with. I'll continue to work with you. If we keep control of the committee, Senator Grassley would be the chairman next year, and I would encourage him to have the hearings that Senator Blumenthal referenced, that this is an ongoing conversation to get it right to the extent that we can get it right. Mr. Dorsey from Twitter, are you with us, Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: I am. Do you hear me? 
GRAHAM: Thank you. The floor is yours. 
DORSEY: Thank you to the members of the Judiciary Committee for the opportunity to speak with the American people about Twitter and your concerns around censorship and suppression of a specific news article, and generally what we saw in the 2020 U.S. elections conversation. 
We were called here today because of an enforcement decision we made against the New York Post based on a policy we created in 2018 to prevent Twitter from being used to spread hacked materials. This resulted in us blocking people from sharing a New York Post article publicly or privately. We made a quick interpretation, using no other evidence, that the materials in the article were obtained through hacking, and according to our policy we blocked them from being spread. Upon further consideration, we admitted this action was wrong and corrected it within 24 hours. 
We informed the New York Post of our error and policy update and how to unlock their account by deleting the original violating tweet, which freed them to tweet the exact same content and news article again. They chose not to, instead insisting we reverse our enforcement action. We did not have a practice around retroactively overturning prior enforcements, and in a sense it demonstrated that we needed one, and so we created one we believe is fair and appropriate. 
I hope this illustrates the rationale behind our actions and demonstrate our ability to take feedback, admit mistakes and make changes all transparently to the public. We acknowledge there are still concerns around how we moderate content and specifically our use of section 230. Three weeks ago we proposed three solutions to address the concerns raised, and they all focus on services that decide to moderate or remove content. It could be expansions to section 230, new legislative frameworks or commitment to industrywide self-regulation best practices. 
Requiring one moderation process and practices to be published; two, a straightforward process to appeal decisions; and three, best efforts around algorithmic choice are suggestions to address the concerns we all have going forward. And they are all achievable in short order. 
It's critical, as we consider these solutions, we optimize for new startups and independent developers. Doing so ensures a level playing field that increases the probability of competing ideas to help solve problems going forward. We mustn't entrench the largest companies any further. 
Finally, before I close, I wanted to share some reflections on what we saw during the U.S. presidential election. We focused on addressing attempts to undermine civic integrity, providing informative context and product changes to encourage greater conversation. We updated our civic integrity policy to address misleading or disputed information that undermines confidence in the election, causes voter intimidation or suppression or confusion about how to vote or misrepresents affiliation or election outcomes. 
More than a year ago, the public asked us to offer additional context to help make potentially misleading information more apparent. We did exactly that, applying labels to over 300,000 tweets from October 27 to November 11, which represented about 2.2 percent of all U.S. election related tweets. We also changed how our product works in order to help increase context and encourage more thoughtful consideration before tweets are shared broadly. We're continuing to assess the impact of these product changes to inform our long-term roadmap. Thank you for the time. I look forward to a productive discussion focused on solutions. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. Dorsey. Mr. Zuckerberg. 
ZUCKERBERG: Thank you, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Blumenthal and members of the committee. At last year's hearing--at last month's hearing I spoke about the role internet platforms play in supporting democracy, keeping people safe and upholding fundamental values like free expression. People have deeply held beliefs about these issues and can reach very different conclusions about the right balance. We try to do what's best for our community and the world, acknowledging that there are difficult trade-offs. I believe that some of these trade-offs and decisions would be better made through a democratic process, and I look forward to discussing that today. 
But first, I want to update you on our efforts during the election. At Facebook, we took our responsibility to protect the integrity of this election very seriously. In 2016 we began to face new kinds of threats, and after years of preparation we were ready to defend against them. We built sophisticated systems to protect against election interference that combined artificial intelligence, significant human review and partnerships with the intelligence community, law enforcement and other tech platforms. We've taken down more than 100 networks of bad actors who are trying to coordinate and interfere globally. We established a network of independent fact checkers that covers more than 60 languages. We made political advertising more transparent on Facebook than anywhere else, including TV, radio and email. And we introduced new policies to combat voter suppression and misinformation. 
Still, the pandemic created new challenges, how to handle misinformation about COVID and voting by mail, how to prepare people for the reality that results would take time and how to handle if someone prematurely declared victory or refused to accept the result. So in September we updated our policies again to reflect these realities of voting in 2020 and make sure that we were taking precautions given these unique circumstances. We worked with the local election officials to remove false claims about polling conditions that might lead to voter suppression. We partnered with Reuters and the National Election Pool to provide reliable information about results. We attached voting information to posts by candidates on both sides and additional context to posts trying to delegitimize the outcome. 
We locked down new political ads in the week before the election to prevent misleading claims from spreading when they couldn't be rebutted. We strengthened our enforcement against malicious and conspiracy networks like QAnon to prevent them from using our platforms to organize violence or civil unrest. Altogether, I believe this was the largest election integrity effort by any private company in recent times. This is what people expect of us. And I'm glad that from what we've seen so far, our systems performed well. But election interference remains an ongoing threat that will never fully be solved. So we continue to improve with each election. 
But our integrity work is really only half the story. We also ran an unprecedented civic engagement program to encourage people to take part in our democracy. We ran the largest voter information campaign in history. 140 million people visited our voting information center including more than 33 million on Election Day alone. We estimate that we helped more than 4.5 million people register to vote and helped states recruit 100,000 poll workers. This was done in a transparent and nonpartisan way as part of our ongoing commitment to supporting the civic process. 
And on top of these efforts by Facebook, my wife Priscilla and I personally donated $400 million to support election officials around the country in making sure that they have the infrastructure they needed to enable everyone to vote safely during this pandemic. In my last testimony I said that people would judge us by our performance during this election, and I believe that the full story is not only how we handle bad behavior on our platforms, but also how we encouraged civic engagement more broadly. I'm proud of the work we've done to support our democracy, and I look forward to discussing this. 
I also welcome the opportunity to discuss internet regulation. I believe we are well overdue to update the rules for the internet around content, elections, privacy and data portability. There are important questions here, including who should be responsible for what people say online. For any system to work, I believe there needs to be a transparent process that people feel they can trust. And this will be difficult, especially since our country is so divided. But I believe it's the only way to address these issues for the long-term. The challenges that we face are deeper than any one platform. 
[*]ZUCKERBERG: They're about how we want to balance basic social equity that we all care about like free expression, public safety and privacy. This is why I believe we would benefit from clearer guidance from elected officials and I look forward to discussing this today. 
GRAHAM: Well, thank you both. We'll have one round and seven minutes as always; I'll try to be a little bit liberal with the time cause this is very important topic. So let's just get right into it. Mr. Dorsey, you can go first and then Mr. Zuckerberg. When you heard Senator Blumenthal's opening statement and mine, what did you get from it? 
DORSEY: Well, I think you--you pointed out that we are facing something that feels impossible. We are--we are required to help increase the health of the public conversation while at the same ensuring that as many people as possible can participate. And in order to do so we need to make policies so that people feel safe and they feel free to express themselves. To minimize the threats of abuse, of harassment, of misleading information, of organized campaigns to artificially amplify or influence a particular conversation. 
And that policy creation that enforcement is challenging but also it is more or less opaque to the public and that's where I think we have a gap. We have transparency around our policies. We do not have transparency around how we operate content moderation, the rationale behind it, the reasoning. And as we look forward we have more and more of our decisions of our operations moving to algorithms which are have a difficult time explaining whey they make decisions. Bringing transparencies round those decisions. And that is why we believe that we should have more choice in how these algorithms are applied to our content--whether we use them at all so we can turn them on and off. And have clarity around the outcomes that they are projecting and how they affect our experience. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Mr. Zuckerberg, very quickly, please. What did you hear? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator I--I heard that there are issues around content moderation as well as other areas and frankly, I'm optimistic from the statements that we may be able to move forward and hopefully update some of the--the rules from the internet around these areas. I have been encouraging and hoping that we would do this for--for a couple of years. And from your opening statements it sounds like there may be now enough common ground on views that real progress can be made here. 
GRAHAM: So from my point of view the question for us is when it comes time to flagged content as being reliable or not reliable do either one of you believe that the government should do that? Is that a solution where the government sets a regulatory scheme that talks about what should be up and what should be down? 
DORSEY: I don't believe so. I--I think that would be very challenging. 
GRAHAM: OK. Do you agree with that, Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, for certain types of illegal content I think it may be appropriate for--for there to be clear rules around that. But outside of clear harms in--including things like child exploitation and--and areas like that, terrorism I--I would agree with your sentiment that that's not something that government should be siding on a piece of content by piece of content basis. 
GRAHAM: So if we take the government out of the picture at least in noncriminal areas--should we leave it up to the industry to come up with best business practices in terms of how to moderate content? 
DORSEY: (INAUDIBLE) I think we need to align around the problem that we are trying to solve. And there are many solutions to solving those problems. I think we also have to focus our efforts on what is going to have the greatest impact. And we believe that the greatest impact is going to be found in how we deal with algorithms, how we use those algorithms. Cause they are responsible for showing us what we see or what we don't see. And they need to be--there needs to be more choice in--in their use. 
GRAHAM: Do you agree to that, Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think that--that there is a role for regulation on the process even if not defining on a piece of content by piece of content basis. One of the areas that I've advocated for is regulation around transparency. That goes beyond just--just about what the policies are and--and what the process is but also goes towards the results. You know, as an example of this every quarter Facebook releases a community standards enforcement report it's basically a transparency report that breaks down each category of harm--potentially harmful content that we track ranging from terrorism to child exploitation content to incitement of violence to pornography (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: Yes, if I may--I don't mean to interrupt but who sets those community standards? How are they set by the company? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we have a policy team that consults with a number of different stakeholders and outside groups to make sure we are getting feedback from broad swaths of our community (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: Is that--is that publicly known? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I believe so and our head of--of content policy has testified publicly multiple times. 
GRAHAM: OK. So when it comes to fact checking will you send us a list of people you use to fact check? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes. We work with a number of independent organizations that are accredited by the--the Pointer Institute. And they include Reuters, the Associated Press, Agence France Presse(PH) United States, USA Today, FactCheck.org, Science Feedback, PolitiFact, Check Your Fact, Lead Stories and the Dispatch in the United States. 
GRAHAM: OK I think it's important for the public to know who sets community standards, how they're set, who does the fact checking, who you rely upon to do that. I think that would go a long way to people having a better understanding of the decisions you make. 
Mr. Zuckerberg, do you believe your product can be addictive? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I--we certainly do not design the product in that way. We design the product to be as useful and meaningful as possible. We take steps-- 
GRAHAM: That's not my question. My question is there seems to be an ample body of growing medical evidence that social media sites have an addictive nature to them. Do you agree with that? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I don't think the research has been conclusive but it is an area that we care about and study. We certainly do not want our products to be addictive. We want people to use them because they're meaningful. And we take steps to make sure this is the case. So, for example, we don't give the team that's running newsfeed a goal around how much time people spend on our products which goes counter to a lot of the--the memes and misinformation out there on how we operate. 
But my goal is to help people connect and find content and interactions that are going to be meaningful to them on our service. And our view is that if--if that is what we deliver over the long-term and people find our services useful then they'll use them more. But I--I don't think that company should be optimizing to just encourage people to spend as much time as possible on them. 
GRAHAM: Time is about up. Have you seen the movie, Social Dilemma? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm familiar with it. 
GRAHAM: OK. Have you seen it, Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: No. I have not. 
GRAHAM: I would encourage both of you to see it. So here is what we are going to do on the committee over time I hope--is to ask the question more directly, are these social media sites addictive? Do they have a public health component that needs to be addressed? For years, we thought tobacco was a great thing. We found out, tobacco is not such a great thing. 
The medical science around these websites are becoming very concerning to me particularly among children and that you can manipulate how many times you watch. And you can set these media sites up so that people will constantly interact. So to both of you, I appreciate you coming before the committee. We got a long way to go. I don't think the government needs to regulate what we think or what we say. But we've got to up our game here and I'll end with this last question-- Did both of you support change to 230 reform to section 230? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do. 
GRAHAM: Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: Yes. 
ZUCKERBERG: Thank you. Senator Blumenthal? 
BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[*]BLUMENTHAL: Let me bring this down to very practical terms. We're in the middle of another election. This election in Georgia could determine, in fact, which party controls the United States Senate. I'm concerned that both of your companies are in fact backsliding or retrenching, that you are failing to take action against dangerous disinformation, exactly the same kind of voter suppression tactics that existed in the last election, and that you are in fact reducing content modification. 
The fighting words and hate speech in the last election could inflame violent and send poll workers into hiding, discourage people from coming to the polls, we have to expect the same kinds of malign tactics. In fact, they are already visible. And I'm going to ask, Mr. Chairman, that these post and tweets be entered into the record, if there's an objection, that are aimed at delegitimizing the election in January. 
My question to you is will you commit to the same kind of robust content modification playbook in this coming election including fact checking, labeling, reducing the spread of misinformation, and other steps even for politicians in the runoff elections ahead? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, our policy is to have a similar approach in the upcoming Georgia special elections that we took during the--the general election. 
BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: Yes, we do. We--and we intend to learn from what we experience with the selection and bring all that learning going forward to making it more robust. 
BLUMENTHAL: During the past election, there was rampant disinformation on social media in Spanish speaking sites repeating QAnon conspiracies and false claims of election rigging. In my view, you need to do better. Will you commit to taking steps to improve content modification for Spanish-speaking communities before the Georgia runoff? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, this is something that we are--we are already working on and worked on ahead of the general election. We have multiple fact checkers who focus on the--on Spanish as--as a language. And we made sure that we translated our voter information center into Spanish, which we showed at the top of--of Facebook and--and Instagram to everyone who uses those products in Spanish in--in the U.S. Those are a couple of the steps that we've taken, and we're certainly committed to focusing on this. 
DORSEY: And yes, we will, and in partnership with Latinx civil rights groups. 
BLUMENTHAL: I'd like to know, and perhaps you could submit to me within one week, what additional steps you're going to take because this Georgia runoff is underway. And as I've indicated, I've seen a backsliding and retrenchment that is very deeply troubling that have enabled the spread of this disinformation, the restarting of certain algorithms, for example, that promote or amplify misinformation is very, very troubling. And I think--I want to know within a week what additional steps you are taking to enhance the efforts to stop this kind of amplification and spread. 
Let me ask about Facebook community standards, which banned language that ""Incites or facilitates serious violence."" As you know, on November 5th, Stephen Bannon in a Facebook Live video, called for beheadings of Dr. Fauci and FBI Director Wray for not acting more favorably toward President Trump. Twitter banned Bannon for these remarks. 
You removed the video, Mr. Zuckerberg, but on Thursday you reportedly told Facebook employees that Bannon had not violated enough policies that he should be banned from Facebook. My question to you is how many times is Steve Bannon allowed to call for the murder of government officials before Facebook suspends his account? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, as you say, the content in question did violate our policies and we took it down. Having a content violation does not automatically mean your content--your--your account gets taken down, and the number of strikes varies depending on the amount--the--the type of offense. So, if people are posting terrorist content or child exploitation content, then the first time that they do it, then we will--we will take down their account. 
For other things, it's--it's multiple. I'd be happy to follow up afterwards. We--we try not to disclose-- 
BLUMENTHAL: --Will you-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --These-- 
BLUMENTHAL: --(INAUDIBLE) down his account? 
ZUCKERBERG: Sorry, I didn't hear that. 
BLUMENTHAL: Will you commit to taking down that account, Stephen Bannon's account? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, no, it's--that--that's not what our policies would suggest that we should do in--in this case. 
BLUMENTHAL: According to the internal records that are on the record now leaked by NBC News, Facebook has removed fact checks and forgiven infractions for conservative pages and pendants such as Breitbart, Donald Trump Junior, Eric Trump, and Gateway pundit-based on a fear of accusations of bias. Has Facebook avoided penalizing or fact checking conservative pages that--that violated its policies based on concerns of political bias and allegations of bias? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, no, we--we haven't done that. And I think that those reports mischaracterized the actions that we take. I--I'm not aware of any instance where we have overturned a fact check specifically, and certainly no action like that would be taken for the reasons that--that--that you're saying. 
What we do sometimes is, if--is apply some judgment on whether the repeat offender policies would--would--would render too harsh of a penalty, but that's different from overturning a--a specific fact check and--and is not done for the reasons that you said. 
BLUMENTHAL: Well, I'm very concerned that, in fact, Facebook seems to have a record of making accommodations and caving to conservative pressure. And the president has tried to use an executive order on Section 232, again, bully or browbeat and exert pressure on you and others in this industry. They're, in effect, working the rest and they're winning. 
Let me ask you about antitrust issues. In 2013, Facebook bought Onavo, which is a virtual private records network that claimed it to protect users' privacy. In fact, Onavo's access to private information about its users provided Facebook with unparalleled ability to track potential competition. I want to know whether Facebook used data from Onavo when it decided to purchase WhatsApp in 2014. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I believe that data from Onavo was one of the sources that the team looked at. But I--I don't think it would have taken using Onavo to understand that WhatsApp was a great product, and I don't think that was determinative in--in my decision to pursue that. 
BLUMENTHAL: Well, in fact, the House antitrust report says Onavo data was used to determine whether WhatsApp was ""killing Facebook Messenger."" My time has almost expired, but let me just say finally that antitrust action by the Federal Trade Commission is long-overdue. 
I believe that decisive action is necessary, including very likely breaking up Facebook as a remedy. All options ought to be on the table, including divestment of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC ought to impose strict conditions on how Facebook uses consumer data and competes with rivals, because the abuse of competition must end. 
[*]BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Chairman, I ask that three letters from civil rights groups regarding disinformation and hate speech on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube and also a letter from a coalition of children's protection advocates on the EARN IT Act and child sexual abuse material on digital platform be entered into the record. Thank you both for being here today. 
GRAHAM: Without objection. Senator Cornyn. 
CORNYN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, I'm glad to hear both of our witnesses today say that section 230, that they are open to reform because I think it's fair to say the internet has outgrown section 230. And while we've made some modifications when it comes to terrorism and when it comes to child exploitation, I think there's more to do. 
But I think the question is going to be how this regulation is going to come to pass. I know there's some, including on this committee, who suggest that maybe we ought to create a private right of action so that individuals can sue over claims of violated rights on your platforms. I think that's one form of regulation. It's called regulation by litigation. But it's certainly not my first choice, and it's not optimal. And I don't think it's something we ought to be embracing in the first instance. 
But I do think it's critical that each of you and your counterparts work with us to try to come up with something that will address the concerns, and the basic concern I have is it's hard to know exactly how to classify your business model. We have a provision in the Bill of Rights protecting freedom of the press, but yet here, while we would never let the government regulate what the press writes or doesn't write, essentially we are allowing private companies, which are now de facto public forums, to regulate that speech. And I'm no more comfortable delegating those decisions to you than I am delegating to you my vote in the last or upcoming elections. 
You know, Louis Brandeis famously said that the solution for bad speech is not less speech; it's more speech. And it seems to me like the practices that you are engaging in to tag, remove and otherwise sensor speech on your platforms violates that principle, and I'd like to know why that shouldn't be a better approach by allowing more speech rather than censoring what is perceived as bad speech. 
And then, as I think I've discussed with you, Mr. Zuckerberg, the--I think we're all sort of struggling to come up with what the appropriate analogy here is to your business model. We know as newspapers have become less profitable and many of them gone out of business there's been consolidation in the news media. There is a proliferation of cable TV shows and people being able to get information through a variety of sources. But there's no Walter Cronkite or the big TV networks with the trusted anchor person who people have confidence in who will--that they will shoot with them straight. And so I know it's a very difficult thing to manage, but I would just encourage both of you not to wait for the lawsuits. 
We saw what happened to Microsoft. I think Bill Gates said that was one of his biggest mistakes, failing to engage with some of the antitrust concerns when it came to Microsoft, and he learned that the hard way, and I think there is a better way for the American people, and that's if we work on this together. 
Mr. Zuckerberg, I believe that Facebook publishes on a quarterly basis a report of its actions in this area. Is that correct? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, that's correct. 
CORNYN: And could you describe that for us and what motivated you to undertake that sort of transparency? 
ZUCKERBERG: Yes. Senator, I believe that in order for people to trust that we're doing a good job they have to be able to see the results, and we have to be able to break down content on a kind of category by category basis across all of the different categories of harm, whether it's terrorist content, or child exploitation, or incitement of violence, or pornography or intellectual property violations, how much of the violating content is on our platforms and how effective our systems are at removing it. And what we hold ourselves accountable towards is getting as high a percent of this harmful contents down and addressing it before real people have to experience it and report it to us themselves. 
So in categories where we do quite well, for example, in fighting against terrorist content, our AI systems and counterterrorism teams are able to remove 98 or 99 percent of that harmful content before anyone has to report it to us. In other categories it's more challenging and we're still making more progress. But I think that as part of a regulatory framework here it would be good if every company had to issue a transparency report outlining what they're seeing on their platforms and the results and effectiveness of their content moderation system so that way the people who are responsible for holding all of us accountable, whether it's journalists, Congress, academics, could have an apples to apples comparison about how all the different companies are doing and potentially as part of the law, require that companies even maintain a certain level of effectiveness. 
CORNYN: Thank you. Mr. Dorsey, when Twitter decided to take down the story, the New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop, did you do that under your terms of service, or did you do it under some other claim of authority? 
DORSEY: We did it under our terms of service, which as you know everyone agrees to when they sign up for Twitter, and this was a policy around distribution of hacked materials. We did not want to Twitter to be a distribution point for hacked materials. 
CORNYN: Well, you do realize that by taking down that story you probably gave it more prominence and more visibility than it ever would have gotten had you left it alone? 
DORSEY: We realize that, and we recognize it as a mistake that we made, both in terms of the intention of the policy and also the enforcement action of not allowing people to share it publicly or privately, which is why we corrected it within 24 hours. 
CORNYN: And Mr. Dorsey, why isn't Justice Brandeis's formulation in Whitney v. California, why shouldn't that apply to the internet platforms like yours? In other words, the cure for bad speech is not censorship; it's more speech. Why wouldn't that principle apply in to Twitter? 
DORSEY: I think it does apply. All of our policies are focused on encouraging more speech. What we saw and what the market told us was that people would not put up with abuse, harassment and misleading information that would cause off-line harm, and they would leave our service because of it. So our intention is to create clear policy, clear enforcement that enables people to feel that they can express themselves on our service and ultimately trust it. 
CORNYN: So it was a business decision? 
DORSEY: It was a business decision. 
CORNYN: Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein. 
FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Dorsey, in recent hearings before the Senate Commerce Committee you said, I think, that Twitter has a policy against misinformation relating to civic integrity. President Trump and his allies have tweeted hundreds of false claims about the 2020 election. The pre--Trump has falsely claimed victory and alleged widespread voter fraud. So here's the question. Does misinformation about the results of an election and voter fraud relate to civic integrity? Why or why not? 
DORSEY: Yes, it does, and we label those tweets when the election has not been called yet or multiple sources have called it differently. 
FEINSTEIN: I'm sorry; I didn't understand that. Did you say you have been able to tweet? 
DORSEY: No, we have labeled the tweets that would indicate a different result in the election called by multiple sources. 
FEINSTEIN: I see. At what point was that done? 
DORSEY: Throughout the period, October 11 up till today. 
FEINSTEIN: So when the tweet was initially came in, how long was it before you, quote, updated it? 
DORSEY: We didn't update it. 
[*]DORSEY: We put a label on it pointing to the broader conversation. Our goal is to connect people with more information around what's happening with the election and--and that occurred anywhere from five minutes to 30 minutes. But as quickly as we--as quickly as we can. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Is 30 minutes the maximum time? 
DORSEY: I don't know, we can--we can get you that information (INAUDIBLE)-- 
FEINSTEIN: Would you? I'm--I'm--I'm interested in this. Does misinformation about the results of an election and voter fraud relate to civic integrity, why or why not? 
DORSEY: Yes, it does and we also label those tweets that would--that would indicate whether fraud was happening. And again we--we connect those to larger conversations on the platform. We want to provide context here. That is our goal providing more context, providing more information. 
FEINSTEIN: OK. Now, a specific question. And I'm not sure actually what the answer to this should be but on November 7, President Trump tweeted and I quote, ""I won this election by a lot,"" end quote. Obviously, that's not true. President Trump lost the election. The warning label that Twitter has applied to the tweet says and I quote, ""Official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted."" End quote. Do you believe that label goes far enough to prevent the tweet's harms when the tweet is still visible and not accurate? 
DORSEY: I do because it's not just the surface level label. It points to a collection of news articles, of information and conversation that gives you an expansion on what is happening with the election. 
FEINSTEIN: My concerns are that these tweets arouse people. And it seems to me that the entity that runs this operation ought to have an understanding that when there is major situation that the tweets can play a unique role in either reassuring or stirring people up to unacceptable levels. Could you comment on that? 
DORSEY: Well, I--I agree in spirit. Our policy is focused on misleading information around the election and the civic process to provide greater context, to provide additive information so that people can make decisions around what's happening with the--the election and that is three phases--that is the run up to the election, that is election day. And also the phase we are in right now, post election. So our policies and enforcement are focused on providing more information, more context to people in those three phases. 
FEINSTEIN: Well, let me give you a specific on November 7, President Trump tweeted this-""I won this election by a lot."" End quote. That's obviously not true. President Trump lost the election. The warning label that Twitter has applied to the tweet says, and I quote, ""Official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted."" End quote. Now, here is the question--does that label do enough to prevent the tweet's harms when the tweet is still visible and is not accurate? 
DORSEY: I believe it's really important that we show people a broader context and that is the intention of the label. It is not just text below a tweet it is a link to connect to a much larger conversation and news articles across the spectrum. 
FEINSTEIN: Well, give me an example. What would have to happen before the situation would warrant a stronger response? 
DORSEY: Well, we did have stronger responses during election day and--and the week after where we did put an interstitial meaning that we had to click through to see the content of the tweet and limit its spread for any--anything that went against our civic integrity policy including premature calls to the--to election results. 
FEINSTEIN: Well, let me give you one more. On November 12th, President Trump tweeted a conspiracy theory that 2.7 million votes for him were deleted. The warning label that Twitter has applied to that tweet says quote, ""This claim about election fraud is disputed."" Now, here's the question and--and I think it is a tough issue--do you believe this label does enough to prevent the tweet's harms when the tweet is still visible? It's a highly emotional situation but the tweet has no factual basis? 
DORSEY: But the tweet has a link to more information, to more conversation and more context that informs the situation what's--what's happening. So I--I do believe that connecting people to the larger conversation, giving them more context is the right path here. 
FEINSTEIN: But they have to move to solicit that contact, right? It's not contained as an addendum to the original tweet. 
DORSEY: The label is an addendum to the original tweet and if you tap on it or click it you will go to an expansion of the information. 
FEINSTEIN: I see. Can I ask a question of Mr. Zuckerberg? 
GRAHAM: Yes, you may. One more if that would be OK. 
FEINSTEIN: OK. Mr. Zuckerberg, at the recent hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, you said that Facebook has a quote, ""Policy in place that prevents any candidate,"" end quote from, quote, ""Trying to delegitimize the result of the election,"" end quote. But the hashtags, stealthevote, and voter fraud garnered more than 300,000 interactions on your platform in the hours after Mr. Trump falsely declared victory. So here's the question--do you believe Facebook did enough to prevent Trump's efforts to delegitimize the election result? If so, why have you reached that conclusion? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I believe that we have--we have taken some very significant steps in this area not just the--the adding additional context to specific posts and making it so that when--when people search for--for different hashtags we show additional information. But we also took the unprecedented step of putting the voter information center at the top of Facebook and Instagram for everyone in the U.S. that showed them reliable information about the election including partnering with organizations like Reuters and the National Election Pool to show them accurate information about the results of the election. 
So all taken together I think that we really went quite far in terms of helping to distribute reliable and accurate information about what was going on during this election. 
FEINSTEIN: OK. Let me give you one more along this line. After President Trump falsely claimed that the election was being stolen a group called Stop the Steal, was started on Facebook. It grew to more than 300,000 users in less than a day making it one of the fastest growing groups, I understand, in Facebook history. You shut the group down but substantial damage already had been done. 
Trump supporters, some of them armed with assault weapons, held Stop the Steal rallies outside of election offices. In Philadelphia, two armed supporters who had traveled from Virginia were arrested on their way to the city's vote counting center. Here's the question, and this is a tough one--what are your concerns about the spread of misinformation no matter how innocent it is like or it is not innocent like Trump's claims about the election that they may incite violence? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator I'm--I'm very worried about--about this. Especially, any misinformation or content that could incite violence and during such a volatile period like this one of our top priorities is making sure that people don't' use our platform to--to organize any violence or civil unrest. And that was the basis under which we took that group because there were a--a number of members who were posting potentially violent or--or encouraging violent comments that violated our--our policies. We also have broader policies in place around trying to slow the spread of misinformation more broadly even when it's not going to lead to some kind of violence or eminent harm. 
[*]ZUCKERBERG: And that's why we've created this independent fact checking program where we work with more than 80 partners around the world to help do fact checking because people in our community have told us they don't want to see misinformation, but they also don't want us to be deciding what is true and false. So we--so we've taken the step of building this program, which I believe is more sophisticated than what anyone else in our industry has. So I'm very focused on these issues. 
FEINSTEIN: Well, I'm happy to hear that because I'm really struck by it, that people armed with assault weapons as a product of a tweet could rally outside an election office, and I think it's really a serious issue that needs to be considered, and there need to be, once you signal that and people respond to it, it has to be in some way abated or some way pointed out or restructured on the internet itself. Now can you respond to that? 
GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein, I-- 
FEINSTEIN: --and concerns? 
GRAHAM: I hate to--we're almost double the time. Could we-- 
FEINSTEIN: I'm sorry. 
GRAHAM: That's all right. We're going to have a vote come up, and I apologize. Senator Lee. 
LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I'd like to note that as far as the president's arguments about the election and how they turned out, inciting violence, I'd like to point out that the only violence that I'm aware of has occurred in connection with Antifa, Antifa's response to pro-Trump peaceful rally attenders. So I don't quite understand that. Maybe we'll have a chance to dwell on that more in a minute. 
But first I want to talk a little bit about federal law, existing federal law and what it requires. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits businesses from engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices. Compliance with this particular law requires that there be some consistency between what a company represents as their practices and their products and what they actually are. In other words, you can't sell one thing and provide another under the guise of providing something different than what's being sold. 
Both Twitter and Facebook represent and have represented for years to their users, their customers, that they take a neutral approach to election content moderation. However, as we've heard today and as we will continue to hear today and into the foreseeable future, there are instances in which your platforms are taking a very distinctively partisan approach and not a neutral one, to election related content moderation. 
For example, just days before the election Twitter suspended the account of Mark Morgan. Now Mark Morgan is the commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office, and they suspended Commissioner Morgan's Twitter account specifically for a tweet celebrating the success of the U.S. southern border wall. Apparently Commissioner Morgan's tweet, his comments about the border wall, violated Twitter platform rules governing what it calls hateful conduct. 
Now I've read the offending post, and the offending post from Commissioner Mark Morgan reads as follows: As CBP and the Army Corps of Engineers continue to build new wall every day, every mile helps us stop gang members, murderers, sexual predators and drugs from entering our country. It's a fact; walls work. Period, close quote. Mr. Dorsey, can you tell me in one sentence what exactly is hateful about Commissioner Morgan's tweet that I just read? 
DORSEY: Well, we evaluated this tweet again, and we found that we were wrong. That was a mistake, and it was due to the fact that we had heightened awareness around government accounts during this time. So that was a mistake. We reverted it. 
LEE: Thank you. I appreciate that, and we're going to get back to more of that in a minute and get back to the fact that, you know, I understand that mistakes happen, but what we're going to see today is that mistakes happen a whole lot more, almost entirely on one side of the political aisle rather than the other. Now Commissioner Morgan's statement in that tweet, as was initially taken down, is factual. There's nothing remotely hateful about it, and yet it was taken down. 
Now on October 15 Facebook relied on a third-party fact checker's assessment to ban two advertisements from Facebook for, quote, partly false information. Both of these advertisements were factual in nature. They revealed Joe Biden's and Kamala Harris's views on late-term abortion. Joe Biden has stated that he won't accept any restrictions on abortion, and Senator Harris's views are such that she voted against requiring care for a child born alive during a botched abortion. 
The very next day the third-party fact checker issued a statement retracting the assessment and re-tracking it as erroneous. However, it stunningly took Facebook almost two more weeks until October 29 when voting had already started in many jurisdictions to lift the ban on these legitimate ads, ads that the fact checker had already declared a couple weeks earlier were erroneously taken down. So Mr. Zuckerberg, why on earth did it take Facebook two weeks to correct this error? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not familiar with the details of us re-enabling that ad, so I can follow up with you after. It's possible that this was just a mistake or delay, and unfortunately when we handle millions or billions of pieces of content a day while we strive to do as well as possible and be as precise as possible, we will make some mistakes. 
LEE: Thank you. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the fact that there are mistakes. As I've noted previously, those mistakes sure happen a whole lot more on one side of the political spectrum than the other. Now this is understandable. We're humans. But it's also understandable why this might occur. Maybe some of it has to do with your employees. 92.83 percent of Facebook employees who have donated to federal candidates gave to Democrats. At Twitter it's even more stark than that, as if it could get much more stark, but 99.3 percent of Twitter employees who have donated to federal candidates gave to Democrats. And so these mistakes, they may be mistakes, but they are mistakes that rhyme. They may not repeat themselves, but they rhyme, and the consistent theme happens to be Republicans, conservatives and pro-life activists. 
Now I'd like to ask both of you, is there a list of every user or every content creator who has been de-platformed or had their contents reach altered or had some other adverse action taken by either Facebook or Twitter altered? Is there some list that identifies each user for which that has happened? Mr. Zuckerberg, let's hear from you, just yes or no question. Does such a list exist? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not aware of anything like that existing. 
LEE: Mr. Dorsey, how about you? 
DORSEY: I'm not exactly sure what you're asking, but we certainly-- 
LEE: Simple question. Do you have a list of people, your users or content creators who have had some adverse action taken against them, either being de-platformed or having their reach altered or something because of the content of their posts? 
DORSEY: Well certainly whenever we take an action it's recorded somewhere in a database, but I'm not sure if that's your intent. 
LEE: No, that's helpful. So what I'm hearing from both of you is that while there may not be an actual list, and I'd like you both to check to see if such a list exists--but even if there isn't, there is a de facto list because you have within your databases records of occasions when this has occurred, and so I'd like to ask both of you if such a list exists, please send it to me. I'd like to see it. If such a list does not exist, you certainly do have the data necessary in order to generate some. I request as a member of this committee that you generate such a list and provide it to me. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Graham, the chairman of the committee, has stepped out momentarily. I've been directed to recess the hearing momentarily so that we can go and vote, and then we will pick up back here in just a few minutes. I would like to, as long as I have the gavel momentarily, I'm going to ask one more question before I leave to go vote, and then we'll recess the hearing after this-- 
LEAHY: And could I ask when we're coming back? I've been waiting to ask questions for an hour now. 
LEE: Yeah, we'll be coming back as soon as Senator Graham returns--he left to vote and--just a moment ago. He'll be back. 
Mr. Zuckerberg, in September Facebook tagged an ad run by the American Principles Project in Michigan that criticized Joe Biden and criticized Senator Gary Peters. And the--the--the ad was tagged because it was ""missing context."" Now, the next day the ad was shut down entirely by Facebook. Facebook relied on a supposed effect track from PolitiFact, which is a nice way for you to avoid taking accountability for the problem, except that the fact checking question literally said that the ad, quote, makes ""predictions we can't fact check."" 
Apparently, this had to do with collecting context. When it did lacking context become a new standard for political ads? I mean, all political ads, all ads in general but certainly all political ads, lack context. Ben Sasse just finished a resounding victory in Nebraska, and I haven't seen his TV ads but I'm sure they're brilliant. Those guy's made for television, he's--with or without the beard. 
And I'm sure his ads didn't say Ben Sasse, great senator but not that great of a hockey player or--there is always context that is lacked out--that is lacking, left out, in any advertisement. So, what does that mean? And have you applied the missing context label to any Democratic ads, a single one that you can identify? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm--I'm not familiar with that specific standard. But as a--as kind of a background on the--the fact checking program, the basis of this is that we have heard resoundingly from our community that people do not want to see this information and believe that it is a problem. But people also believe that they do not want Facebook to be the arbiter of truth in deciding everything that is true and false. And for what it's worth, I strongly agree with that, and--and I do not think it is the right thing for us to assume that role. 
So, within those bounds, we've tried to create a fact checking program that works with independent third parties who've been accredited by the--the Poynter Institute for--for Journalism, which I--which I think is widely respected. And we--we give those fact checkers the latitude to determine whether ads or other content on our service is--is accurate. And--and if not, we--we apply some demotions or we prevent them from being run as ads. I can follow up in--in more detail afterwards on-- 
LEE: --Thank you-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --On the specifics of--of--of your question, since I'm--I'm not as familiar with them right now. 
LEE: I--I would appreciate that very much, if--if you'd be willing to do that because it's--it's not only consistent with--with logic and with what--the standards that apply in every other advertising context that I'm familiar with, it's also inconsistent with what Facebook itself does. 
Just to give you some context for that while we're talking about missing context, I recently posted something about the election on Facebook. In my Facebook post was almost immediately tagged with the following. ""Election officials say that voter fraud, which is historically rare, has not affected the outcome of--in this election. They have confirmed that mail-in voting was conducted in accordance with state voting rules."" 
Now, I find this a little disturbing. The town--tag, to me, sounds a whole lot more like state run media announcing the party line rather than a--a neutral company, as it purports to be, running an open online forum. This kind of editorializing insulates people from the truth, and it insinuates that anyone concerned about voter fraud must be crazy. It also states it as if it were an irrefutable, neutral, objective fact. 
Now, maybe these kinds of concerns are out of the mainstream in Palo Alto, but they're not out of the mainstream with the rest of America. And I--I--I--I have to reiterate, I--I hope this kind of manipulation wasn't intentional, but it's getting harder and harder for me to accept the premise that it could be anything but intentional. And if it was intentional, it's yet more evidence that Facebook's actions surrounding this election are incongruent with the promises that you've made to your own users, and that the problem. 
Consistent with the directions that have been given by Chairman Graham, we're now going to recess. I predict we'll be in recess for no more than 10 or 15 minutes until Chairman Graham returns. We stand in recess. 
[*]KENNEDY: The committee will come to order. Senator Leahy. 
LEAHY: Thank you. Can you hear me all right? 
KENNEDY: Yes, sir. 
LEAHY: Good. Well, let me start by-- 
KENNEDY: We can see you, too, Senator. You look great. 
LEAHY: It's my thick head of hair. That's what does it. But I want to say I recognize the challenging position that social media companies are in. Your platforms hosts much of the news that America and actually the world use to stay informed, so you're on the front line of both domestic and foreign disinformation campaigns, and you have to balance American ideals like freedom of speech. You have to limit hate speech. You have to limit dangerous misinformation. That's a significant challenge. 
I saw one of the people who came here to demonstrate last weekend in Washington say they're there because they had found out that China had one minute before the polls closed dumped millions of votes for Joe Biden. Somebody said, well, what do you mean? They said, well it was on the internet; it's got to be accurate. 
But now your platforms have taken some positive steps. But I mentioned that one thing, and I hear from people all the time who stop me with some of these misinformation, sometimes very dangerous misinformation. They've gotten it from your platforms, and I happen to think you can and must do better. You know, our security, I think even our democracy, our understanding of basic truth depends on you doing a better job. 
President Obama described the escalating erosion of the acceptance of facts of science of clear evidence as truth decay. It's a--you know, without facts it's hard to imagine how a government by and for the people can exist, and your platforms can bring together. I think often they act as a form of driving people apart. Now, during this election President Trump has emerged as the most prominent distributor of false and misleading election information. He still does it. It's nothing short of propaganda. 
Without evidence, he routinely claims the election was rigged, says the states actually cheated and fixed the results, even claims that millions of Trump votes were deleted. And he's doing that while his own Department of Homeland Security is saying the election was the most secure in American history. And there's no evidence any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised. 
That's what our own U.S. government is saying. Then the head of government, the president is saying just the opposite. So it may make him feel better about the fact that he lost badly, but we shouldn't have to put up with it. So I have a question for both of you. Has Facebook or Twitter conducted an in-depth postmortem review of election misinformation spread onto your platforms, not just what you labeled, but how far the misinformation reached? Have you done that kind of a postmortem? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we will do that analysis, and also we are commissioning and working with independent academics to enable them to do the studies themselves and to publish what they find without any intervention or permission required from Facebook. 
LEAHY: Thank you, and. 
DORSEY: And we are doing the same, including opening up our APIs to researchers to make sure that others are able to see what we may not--we may not see ourselves. 
LEAHY: Will that be made available to us? Can other people see that results of that study you're going to do? Both of you, I'd ask. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes, the academic research is going to be public and the academics are going to be able to publish this themselves without even having to get Facebook's approval over what they publish. 
LEAHY: Thank you. Mr. Dorsey. 
DORSEY: We'll make our reports and findings public, as well, so everyone can learn. 
LEAHY: I look forward to reading them. I'm actually one member of the Senate who will actually read them. So thank you. Because you know, you look at some of the things that went on, there was--I know Senator Blumenthal and others have raised this question about the Steve Bannon putting on a video. Think of what it did. It called for the murder, the beheading of Dr. Fauci and the director of the FBI Christopher Wray. Just think what that does. I mean, the FBI director travels with security all the time. Dr. Fauci and his family are private citizens. They're calling for their beheading. 
And it was seen by I think 200,000 people on Facebook. Now if you're going to have somebody threatening to murder somebody, what do you do about that? I mean, how do you catch that in a hurry because I mean I was a prosecutor. I prosecuted murderers, and we didn't have to face this kind of threat at that time. But what do you do when hundreds of thousands of people see a threat go murder somebody? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, in that case that content violated our policies and we took it down, and as has been the subject of some of the other questions, if someone had multiple offenses like that we would remove their whole account. 
LEAHY: I'm sure that's a--the threat that do mul--if they multiple times say go out and murder somebody, cut off their head, you know we're going to face a real problem. Facebook will take down our posting. Oh my goodness, what a deterrent. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, what we try to do is identify content that violates our policy before anyone in the community has to see it or even report it to us. And for some categories like terrorism, which I have cited before, you know, about 98 or 99 percent of the content that we take down, our AI and human systems find before anyone even has to report it to us. On hate speech, we're up to 94 percent of the content that we take down our AI systems and content reviewers find it before people have to report it to us. What we try to drive on more effectiveness is basically funding more and more of that harmful content earlier before it is seen broadly across our system. 
LEAHY: Let me ask you about that because, you know, we've had these discussions before. I'm deeply concerned about Facebook's role in spreading hate speech in Myanmar, hate speech that helped fuel a genocide against the Muslim Rohingya people, and I mean horrible. I've seen the pictures. I've seen some of the genocide. You've made some progress about this since you and I talked about it last, but my understanding is that Facebook shuts down specific accounts that violates your content related policy, but then the user can of course just create a new account. 
In Myanmar, for example, on October 8, Facebook took down 38 inauthentic accounts created and controlled by members of Myanmar military in part to to promote anti-Rohingyan content. And I compliment you for doing that. But Myanmar military just turned around and created new accounts that promote the same content. So in some way you've got a whack-a-mole problem here. But is there a way that we can--you can stop these things, not just at the account level, at the user level? And I use that as an example because people are being murdered in a systematic genocide. 
GRAHAM: Please answer Senator Leahy's question. Then we'll need to move on. But go ahead. 
[*]LEAHY: And I'm sorry to take--but--but the previous questioner took all his time, plus all the time that-- 
GRAHAM: --No, no, I agree-- 
LEAHY: --Had been allotted to me. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. No, no, we're at 2.5 minutes, and let's just wrap it up. But to go ahead and answer the question. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, you're correctly pointing out that we did disable certain generals in the--in the Myanmar military as dangerous figures and they are not allowed to sign up. But as you point out, these kind of integrity problems are not ones that there's a silver bullet or where you can never fully solve them. You will--we will always be working to help minimize the prevalence of harm. 
In the same way that a city will never eliminate all crime, you try to reduce it and--and get it--and--and have it be as little as possible. And that's what--what we try to do through a combination of building AI systems to identify purple content up front, hiring thousands of people and tens of thousands of people to do content review, and partnering with organizations, whether it's in the intelligence community, law enforcement, election officials, or in Myanmar, local society to help us like things that we should be aware of and--and--and on high alert about. 
LEAHY: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I'll have some questions for the record for both of the witnesses. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. I appreciate that. Senator Cruz? 
CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Facebook and Twitter and Google have massive power. They have a monopoly on public discourse in the online arena. I will say it's dismaying listening to the questions from our Democratic colleagues, because consistently the message from Senate Democrats is for Facebook and Twitter and Google to censor more, to abuse their power more, to silence voices that Senate Democrats disagree with more. 
That is very dangerous if we want to maintain a free and fair democracy, if we want to maintain free speech. There was a time when Democrats embraced and defended the principles of free speech. There was a time when Democrats embraced and defended the principles of a free press. And yet, there's an absolute silence from Democrats speaking up for the press outlets censored by big tech. There's an absolute silence for Democrats speaking out for the citizens silenced by big tech. Instead, there is a demand, use even more power to silence dissent, and that the totalitarian instinct that I think is very dangerous. 
At the same time that big tech exercises massive power; it also enjoys massive corporate welfare. Through the effect of section 230, special immunity from liability that nobody else gets, Congress has given big tech, in effect, a subsidy while they become some of the wealthiest corporations on the face of the planet. 
Mr. Dorsey, I want to focus primarily on Twitter and ask you initially is Twitter a publisher? 
DORSEY: Is Twitter a publisher? 
CRUZ: Yes. 
DORSEY: No, we are not. We--we distribute information. 
CRUZ: So, what is a publisher? 
DORSEY: An entity that is publishing under editorial guidelines and decisions. 
CRUZ: Well, your answer happens to be contrary to the text of a federal statute, particular section 230, which defines an in--information content provider as any person or entity that is responsible in whole or in part for the creation or development of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer service. 
Let me ask you, was Twitter being a publisher when it censored the New York Post? 
DORSEY: No. We have very clear policies on the conduct we enable on the platform. And if there's a violation, we take enforcement action. And people choose to commit to those policies and--and to those terms of service. 
CRUZ: Except your policies are applied in a partisan and selective manner. You claim it was hacked materials, and yet you didn't block the distribution of the New York Times story that alleged to talk about President Trump's tax returns, even though a federal statute makes it a crime to distribute someone's tax returns without their consent. You didn't block any of that discussion, did you? 
DORSEY: Our policy was focused on distribution of the actual hacked materials. 
CRUZ: Did--did you block the-- 
DORSEY: --And in the New York Times-- 
CRUZ: --Discussion of the president's tax return material? 
DORSEY: And in the New York Times case, we interpreted it as reporting about the hacked materials, not distribution of the-- 
CRUZ: Did--did you block Edward Snowden when he--he illegally released material? 
DORSEY: I'm--I--I don't have the answer to that. 
CRUZ: The answer is no. You have used this in a selective manner. 
Let me ask you, where you being a publisher when you forced Politico, an another journalistic outlet, to take down their tweets on a topic that you had deemed impermissible? 
DORSEY: No. We were enforcing our--our policy and our terms of service. 
CRUZ: So, on October 15th, Jake Sherman, a reporter at Politico, tweeted the following. I tweeted a link to the New York Post story right after it dropped yesterday morning. I immediately reached out to the Biden campaign to see if they had any answer. I wish I'd given the story a closer read it before tweaking it. Twitter suspended me. 
So, you actually have a reporter reporting on a story asking the other side for comment. And Twitter says, hi, Jake Sherman, your account, at JakeSherman, has been locked for violating Twitter rules. Now, what did the--what did the Politico reporter do? He immediately tweets after that, ""My goal was not to spread information."" Well, that's a little worrisome just on an--in and of itself. ""My goal was to raise questions about the story."" 
Oh, my overlords in Silicon Valley, I was attacking the New York Post. You don't understand. I was attacking them as I did in subsequent tweets and see how the Biden campaign was going to respond. They later did respond. And then not long after, Jake Sherman comes back with my account is clearly no longer suspended. I deleted the tweets. 
When Twitter is editing and censoring and silencing the New York Post, the--the newspaper with the fourth highest circulation in the country, and Politico, one of the leading newspapers in the country, is Twitter behaving as a publisher when it's deciding what stories reporters are allowed to write and--and publish and what stories they're not? 
DORSEY: No, and that account was not suspended. It fell afoul of the hacked materials policy. We realized that there was an error in that policy and the enforcement. We retracted that within-- 
CRUZ: --Hold--hold on. I'm--I'm literally-- 
DORSEY: --24 hours-- 
CRUZ: --Looking at the tweet from Twitter that says your account has been locked. You're--you're telling me that this is not accurate-- 
DORSEY: --That's a--that's a lock--that's a lock and can be unlocked when you delete the erring tweet. 
CRUZ: I understand that you have the Star Chamber power. Your answer is always, well, once we silence you, we can choose to allow you to speak. But you are engaged with publishing decisions. 
Let--let me shift to a different topic. Mr. Dorsey, does voter fraud exist? 
DORSEY: I--I don't know for certain. 
CRUZ: Are--are you an expert in voter fraud? 
DORSEY: No, I'm not. 
CRUZ: Well, why then is Twitter right now putting purported warnings on virtually any statement about voter fraud? 
DORSEY: We are--we're simply linking to a broader conversation so that people have more information. 
CRUZ: No--no, you're not. You put up a page that says ""Voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States."" That's not linking to a broader conversation. That's taking a disputed policy position. And you're a publisher when you're doing that. You're entitled to take a policy position, but you don't get to pretend you're not a publisher and get a special benefit under section 230 as a result. 
DORSEY: That link is pointing to a broader conversation with tweets from publishers and--and people all around the country. 
CRUZ: Mr. Dorsey, with the following statement violate Twitter's policies? ""Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud."" 
DORSEY: I imagine that we would label it so that people can have more context and read through it. 
CRUZ: Okay. How--how about this quote? ""Third party organizations, candidates, and political activists--voter fraud is particularly possible where, quote, third party organizations, candidates, and political party activists are involved in ""handling absentee ballots."" Would you flag that as potentially misleading? 
DORSEY: I don't--I don't, you know, know the specifics of how we might enforce that, but I imagine a lot of these would--would have a label pointing people to a bigger conversation about our policy. 
CRUZ: Well, you're right. You would label them because you taken the political position right now that voter fraud doesn't exist. I would note both of those quotes come from the Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform. That is Democratic president Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, and Twitter's position is essentially voter fraud does not exist. Are you aware that just two weeks ago in the state of Texas a woman was charged with 134 counts of election fraud? Are you aware that? 
DORSEY: I'm not aware of that. 
CRUZ: If I tweeted that statement with a link to the indictment, would you put a warning on it that says, well, the Democratic Party position right now is voter fraud doesn't exist? 
[*]DORSEY: I--I don't think it's useful to get into hypotheticals but I don't believe so. 
CRUZ: You--you don't believe so. Well, we are going to test that because I'm going to tweet that and we will see what you put on it. All right. Yesterday Mr. Dorsey you and I spent a considerable amount of time on the phone and you said that you wanted to embrace transparency so I want to ask you--I've asked twitter, I've asked Facebook multiple times how many times have you blocked Republican candidates for office their--their tweets or their post in 2016 and 2018 and 2020? How many times have you blocked Democratic candidates for office? 
How many times have you blocked Republican officeholders? How many times have you blocked Democratic officeholders? Twitter has repeatedly refused to answer that question with specific hard data and--and cataloging the examples in the interest of transparency which you said you want to embrace will you commit in this hearing right now to answer those questions in writing? 
GRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) last question. 
CRUZ: I'm sorry Mr. Dorsey I didn't hear you. 
DORSEY: That is exactly what we're--we're pushing for as we think about building upon 230 the transparency-- 
CRUZ: Is that a yes that you will answer those questions in writing? 
DORSEY: Transparency not just of outcomes but also a process as well. 
CRUZ: Is--is that a yes that you will answer those questions in writing? 
DORSEY: We will certainly look into it and see what we can do. 
CRUZ: And actually answer them and not give lawyerly doublespeak about why you are not going to give specifics, answer them will you commit to this committee that you will answer those questions? 
DORSEY: We are going to work to answering broader transparency around outcomes. 
CRUZ: All right, that's a no. Mr. Zuckerberg, how about you? Will you commit that Facebook will answer those specific Russians cataloging the number of instances in which Democrats in 16, 18, and 20 have been silenced versus the number of instances in which Republicans have been silenced on Facebook? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not sure if we have that data available but I will follow up with you or your team. 
CRUZ: Okay. I'm going to take that as a yes and I'm going to take twitter we will see if it's a yes or transparency is bogus and we don't intend to provide it. 
GRAHAM: Senator Durbin? 
DURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We live in a dangerous world. Issues of national security, the worst pandemic public health crisis in modern times in America, and we are being challenged as to whether there's going to be a peaceful transition of power in America in the presidency. 
At that moment in time we decided none of those topics were important and what was important was to determine whether or not social media was discriminating against Republicans. It's an interesting question. I think there are more important and timely questions. We have a recount underway in Georgia, we have allegations made by the election officials there where they the Republican allegations, Republican election officials where they have faced literally death threats. We are trying to determine whether or not the social media instruments of America are fair to the Republican Party. 
I am trying to struggle with this issue because I want to put it in a context and maybe I can't, maybe it's this is unique. We certainly know what the Constitution says when it comes to free speech and we know what it meant over the years the New York Times versus Sullivan and others with publications, we certainly didn't just suggest that anyone that use a telephone line for nefarious a legal band activity somehow implicated the telephone company into it by--by its nature. 
And then came radio and TV and we had to come up with new rules in terms of that one time equal time fair content and so forth and now we have this new relatively new mechanism of communicating information and we are trying to determine what to do with it, whether to treat it like a newspaper publishing or treat it like some sort of a communications network alone section 230 is an attempt to do that and I am sure everybody finds some fault with it. 
I would like to ask the two witnesses if they would comment on the historical aspects of this particular debate, if they have any thoughts. Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, one of the points of the discussion that I find interesting is people asked if the regulatory model should be more like kind of they news industry or more like telcos but from my perspective these platforms are a new industry and should have a different regulatory model that is distinct from either of those other two. I think it is not the case that we are like a telco and that there are clearly some categories of content whether it's terrorism or child exploitation that people will expect us to moderate and address but we are also clearly not like a news publisher in that we don't create the content and we don't choose up front what we publish, we give people a voice to be able to publish things. 
So I do think that we have responsibilities and it may make sense for there to be liability for some of the content that is on the platform but I don't think that the analogies to these other industries that have been created previously will ever be kind of fully the right way to look at this. I think it deserves indeed its own regulatory framework to get built here. 
DURBIN: Thank you. With the other witness care to respond? 
DORSEY: From a historical perspective to 30 has created so much goodness in innovation and you know if we didn't have those protections when we started Twitter 14 years ago we could not start and that is what we are most concerned with is making sure that we continue enable new companies to contribute to the Internet, to contribute to conversation. And we do have to be very careful and thoughtful of about changes to 230 the cause going one direction might box out new competitors and new startups, going another might create a demand for an impossible amount of resources to handle it and going yet another might encourage even more blocking of voices or what is being raised here which is censorship of voices and changing the Internet dramatically so-- 
DURBIN: Go ahead. 
DORSEY: So I--I believe that we can build upon 230. I think that we can make sure that we are earning people's trust by encouraging more transparency around content moderation in our process of it. I think we need much more straightforward appeals and I think the biggest point to really focus on going forward is algorithms and how they are managing and creating these experiences and being able to have choice in how to use those algorithms on platforms like ours. 
DURBIN: Let me get into a specific, Mr. Zuckerberg. October 10 Detroit Free Press reported 13 men charged Thursday in a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Witmer used Facebook and secure messaging apps to connect and plot their attack. The groups use of Facebook spans almost a full year. Members began to use the social media platform as a recruitment tool in November 2019 according to an affidavit by Brian Russell Detective Sergeant Michigan State police. Once recruited members communicated via a secured encrypting message platform. According to news reports Facebook alerted the FBI about the Michigan kidnappers online activities several months before the arrest, thank goodness. 
However, in August a Facebook page for the Kenosha guard militia which advocated violence in the aftermath of the shooting of Jacob Blake was reportedly flagged over 455 times to Facebook however the page was deemed non-violating and left up. More than 4,000 people responded to that event, hundreds of armed militia members showed up, a member of this group, a teenager from Illinois later shot and killed two people on the streets of Kenosha. 
Mr. Zuckerberg, you describe Facebook's handling of this militia page as an operational mistake. Can you explain the exact reason why the Kenosha militia page was not taken down? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes, and first and what happened in Kenosha was obviously terrible. What--what happened here was we rolled out a strengthen policy are round militia pages in general whereas before that we would have allowed a group that was a militia as long as it wasn't planning or organizing violence directly in the lead up to the election, we strengthened the policy to disallow more of those groups because we were on high alert and were treating the situation as very volatile around potential civil unrest around the election. 
We just put that policy into place, and for a number of reasons it had not yet been fully rolled out, and all of the content reviewers across the company hadn't been fully trained on that, so we made mistakes in assessing whether that group should be taken down. 
But upon appeal, when it was escalated to a more senior level of content review folks who have more specific expertise in these areas, we recognize that it did violate the policy, and we took it down. It was a mistake. It was certainly an issue, and we're--we're debriefing and figuring out how we can do better, although one other piece that I would add is that the person who carried out the shootings was not in any way connected to that page or linked to any of the content there from anything that we or others could tell. 
DURBIN: Mr. Chairman, if I may ask one more question. Yesterday, the FBI released its annual hate crime incident report. The report found that more people were killed in hate motivated violence in 2019 than any year since the FBI began collecting hate crime data in 1990. The report also found that race-based hate crimes remain the most common type of hate crimes last year. 
And documented increase in religion-based hate crimes, anti-Hispanic hate crimes and hate crimes targeting individuals based on gender identity. Given these statistics, it appears to me that it's more important than ever for social media companies to combat hate on their platforms, and I might add to one of my colleagues who stated earlier this is not Antifa. But these are documented hate crimes from FBI. 
Muslim advocates, Muslims reached out to you many times, Mr. Zuckerberg, about this issue relating to published content that reflects on certain religious groups, and you said at a hearing you do not allow Face--hate crimes on Facebook. Yet in May 2020 the Tech Transparency Project found more than 100 American white supremacist groups, many of them explicitly anti-Muslim, active on the platform both in their own group pages, as well as auto generated content. Facebook did nominally alter some of the content, but the hate groups largely remained. Are you looking the other way, Mr. Zuckerberg, at a potentially dangerous situation? 
ZUCKERBERG: No, Senator. This is incredibly important, and we take hate speech, as well as incitement of violence, extremely seriously. We banned more than 250 white supremacist organizations and treat them the same as terrorist organizations around the world, and we've ramped up our capacity to identify hate speech incitement of violence before people even see it on the platforms. 
Our AI and human review teams, as you can track our results in the transparency reports that we issue, now take down about 94 percent of the hate speech that we find on our platforms before anyone has to even report it to us, which is a dramatic amount of progress from where we were a few years ago where when we were just starting to ramp up on this, were taking about 20 percent of it down before people had to report it to us. So there is still more progress to make. We're very invested in this, and you have my commitment that we view this as an issue of the highest severity and one that we are very focused on. 
DURBIN: Thank you very much. 
GRAHAM: Senator Sasse. 
SASSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for hosting this hearing. Clearly important topics around content moderation. I'm a skeptic of the content moderation policies that exist both because I don't think the standards are very transparent, and I don't think the execution is very consistent. That said, I'm more skeptical than a lot of my colleagues, I think on both sides of the aisle, about whether or not there is regulatory fix that will make it better instead of worse. 
I especially think it's odd that so many in my party are zealous to do this right now when you would have an incoming administration of the other party that would be writing the rules and regulations about it, and I think it's telling that a number of folks on the other side of the dais--think of Senator Blumenthal, a guy I like, but who seem to almost be giddy about the prospect of a new government regulatory agency to police online speech. And I think a lot of people on my side should take pause at the idea that so many on the other side of the aisle are excited about having the next administration get to write these rules and regulations. 
But to the broader question, first just to get to kind of a level set--and I want to thank both the witnesses for being here today--but when Senator Lee lays out some of the issues he did about, you know, just the every human community is going to be situated in a different place about policy commitments and priorities and beliefs, but when Senator Lee said that 93 percent of Facebook employees who contribute to politics do so on the left, and 99 percent I think it was, of Twitter employees contribute on the left, I would just be interested to see if either of the two of you think that has implications in the shepherding of your organizations? 
Again, I recognize fully that you're private organizations, and so again I'm more skeptical of a governmental fix for a lot of the problems we're talking about here today, but I just am curious as to whether or not Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey--and I guess we'll start with Facebook--I'm curious as to whether or not you think it's likely that there is systemic bias inside your organization in the execution of content moderation policies given that your employee base is so unrepresentative of America in general. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think it's a good question, and certainly I think it means that we have to be more intentional about what we do and thoughtful. Our principle and goal is to give everyone a voice and to be a platform for all ideas. As you mentioned, I do think it's undisputed that our employee base, at least the full-time folks, politically would be somewhat or maybe more than just a little somewhat to the left of where our overall community is where the community basically spends almost--wide varieties of people across society. So I do think that that means that we need to be careful and intentional internally to make sure that bias doesn't seep into decisions that we make. 
Although, I'd point out a couple of things. One is that you know people have a lot of different views outside of work, and we expect and I think generally see that people conduct themselves professionally, and second, the folks who are doing the content review work--we have about 35,000 people doing content review--are typically not based in Silicon Valley. They're based in places all over the country, and all over the world because we serve people in countries all over the world. So I think that the geographic diversity of that is more representative of the community that we serve than just the full-time employee base and our headquarters in the Bay Area. 
SASSE: Thanks, Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Dorsey. 
DORSEY: You know, this is obviously not something we interview for, and even have an understanding of when people are in the company, and with that understanding we intend to make sure that both our policy and our enforcement is objective. And I realize that it looks rather opaque, and certainly the outcomes might not always match up with that intention, with our intention, and the perception of those outcomes would--may not match up, but that's why I think it's so important that we're not just transparent around our policies, but the actual operations of our content moderation. If people don't trust our intent, if people are questioning that, that's a failure. And that is something that we need to fix and intend to fix. 
And I think it would benefit the industry, as well. But I do, again, point back to something I said earlier on the testimony, which is a lot of these decisions are not being made by humans anymore. They're being made my algorithms, and that's certainly enforcement decisions, but also decisions around what you see or what you don't see, and to me that is the body of work. That is the conversation that we should be focused on because that is the enduring use case for everyone who interacts with these services. 
SASSE: Thank you. And I wish it were true that this would all--that these were all easy, you know, objective questions. The questions were if somebody says is the sky green, that's an objective question that the sky is blue and white, not green. But most of the things we're talking about here and the places where you're applying content moderation labels are not really simply objective questions. 
[*]SASSE: They're mostly subjective questions. If--if we talked about Medicare for All being, you know, easily paid for inside a 10 year budget window on assumptions X, Y, and Z that don't raise taxes, that's not true. There isn't any math by which Medicare for All pays for itself in some short-term window, but I don't think any of us really think you're going to slap a label on that saying this is disputed, you know, counting or math or policy projections. 
And so, really what's happening is there's a prioritization grid that people are going through as they build even the algorithms, even those that aren't driven by humans, and they're driven by policy priorities of situated individuals. I may be wrong about this, but my suspicion is that your employee base is not actually 99 percent left of center. I bet it's less than that. 
And I would speculate that part of the reason less than 1 percent of your employees give money to candidates on the right is because there's a social stigma attached to having conservative views inside your organization. And I would guess that the same sort of internal cultural biases inform the subjectivity of which issues end up labeled. 
So, again, this is sort of an odd place to be, in that I am skeptical that the content moderation policies are thought out well. They're not transparent enough for us to really know. But I'm definitely skeptical that they're consistently applied. And yet, I'm not really on the side of thinking there's some easy governmental fix here. There's a lot about section 230 that we could debate. 
I think some of the things Senator Durbin said about how, in the era of telephones, nobody blamed the phone company for other people having spread misinformation by the phone; exactly. That's what would be the case if section 230 were actually neutral. But you're applying content moderation policies and seemingly in a way that's not objective. 
So, I know that I'm--I'm nearly at the time, but I think it would be useful for us to hear from both of you to give a sort of three or five year window into the future, if there isn't new legislation, what is changing what besides just saying we're moving from humans to more AI? What qualitatively is changing in the way content moderation happens inside your organizations short of a new regulatory scheme? Can you tell us where you think you're actually improving and what problems you're trying to solve? Mr. Zuckerberg, you first, please. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, one of the areas that we are very focused on is transparency, both in the process and in the results. So, we're already at the point where every quarter we issue a community standards enforcement report that basically details the prevalence of--of each category of harmful content and how effective we are at addressing it before people have to even reported to us. 
Over time, we would like to fill that out and have more detail on that and make it more robust. And we've already committed to an independent external audit of those metrics so that people can trust them even more. People have lots of different kinds of requests for where we might go with that in the future, whether that's breaking down the--the stats by--by country or--or language or into more granular buckets, adding more data around precision. 
But I think that that would all be very helpful so that people can see and hold us accountable for how we're doing. And for what it's worth, I think that that would be a valuable part of a regulatory framework that would not feel particularly overreaching to me as something that could be put in law that would create an apples to apples framework, that all companies in this space would have to report on the outcomes and effectiveness of their programs in that way so at least we can see how everyone is doing. That seems like a--a sensible step to me. 
SASSE: Thank you. Mr. Dorsey? 
LEE: Senator Whitehouse? 
SASSE: Oh, sorry, Mr. Dorsey is still answering the same question and then I'll--I'll give it back to you in a hurry, Mr. Lee. 
LEE: So sorry. I missed that. 
SASSE: It's a junior acting chairman. Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: Thank you. Well, I mean, if we're--if we're considering 3 to 5 years out, I think the realization that a centralized global content moderation system does not scale, and we need to rethink how we--how we operate these--the services. And I would point to we certainly need transparency around any process that we have an around the practice and the outcomes of those moderations. 
But I think having more control so that individuals can moderate themselves, you know, pushing the power of moderation to the edges and to our customers and to the individuals using the service is something we'll see more of. And I also believe that having more choice around how algorithms are altering my experience in creating my experience is important, so being able to turn off ranking algorithms, being able to choose different ranking algorithms that are found--written by third-party developers in somewhat of an algorithmic marketplace I think is important, and a--a future that would excite and--and energize us. 
SASSE: Thank you. I've appreciated my interaction with both of your companies in the run up to this, anything both of you said some meaty the things that are about ways we can move toward greater transparency. So, I'll--I'll follow up again. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Whitehouse? 
WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Chairman. Gentlemen, let me start with just a moment's history to give some context to my questions. When the tobacco industry discovered that its product was deadly, it responded to that news with a systematized program of denying that set of facts. The upshot for the tobacco industry was not great. It was found in federal court to have been engaged in massive fraud and was put under court order to cease its fraudulent behavior. 
At around the same time, the fossil fuel industry began to run into a similar problem regarding the effects of its product. And it picked up the tobacco industry's scheme kind of where it left off, including using some of the same individuals, some of the same entities, many of the same methods as the tobacco industry's denial operation. 
These are persistent, highly motivated, very well-funded and complex information operations, not unlike an--a hostile intelligence service would run, and they are quite secretive. And we're now seeing a new form, I guess you'd call it election denial, happening around our country right now. 
So, that's a background that I come at this from seeing, and I'm wondering if each of you see a difference between individual error and basically mass disinformation. Is there a difference between odd people with fringe views who offer personal opinions and an orchestrated plan of deliberate misinformation or disinformation that is driven by motivated interests, whether foreign or domestic? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I absolutely think that there is a difference, and you can see it in the--the patterns of the--of use on the--on the platforms. And in our policies and operations, we view these coordinated inauthentic behavior operations, networks of fake and--and--and sometimes combining with real accounts to push out a message but make it seem like it's coming from a different place that it is, or it might be more popular than it is. 
This is what we saw the Internet Research Agency out of Russia do in 2016. And since then, a number of other governments and private organizations, including some--some companies like what you've mentioned, having engaged in this behavior. Now, the--the good news is that I think that the industry has generally gotten its systems to be a lot more sophisticated to defend against that in the--in the last several years. 
The combination of AI systems that we've built to find networks of accounts that aren't really behaving quite the way that a normal person would coupled with large numbers of content reviewers, sometimes with expertise in counterterrorism or--or counterintelligence, and in some signal sharing, whether it's with the intelligence community, law enforcement, different groups that have expertise in different areas, and with other tech platforms. 
But this is a--a big effort on--on I think all of our sides to make sure that we can defend against this kind of interference. And I think we are--we are getting better and better at it. 
WHITEHOUSE: Well, let me encourage you to persist. As you know, the last time you were here, you were asked about advertising paid for on false--Facebook denominated in rubles, which was not a very sophisticated scheme to be able to penetrate, but Facebook was unable to penetrate it. And your upgrade from that original set up was simply to allow a shell corporation to intermediate between the real actor and not. So, I encourage you to continue to try to make sure that real voices are what are heard on Facebook. 
Mr. Dorsey, let me turn to you and--and ask you the same question in the context of bots. 
[*]WHITEHOUSE: Brown University recently did a study that showed that about 25 percent of all tweets about climate change are generated by bots most of them obviously push out climate denial as I described that operation how is Twitter's capacity to identify a bot as opposed to a real customer? 
DORSEY: Well, to build off of your previous question I do think there is a difference as Mark said and I do think there's a many coordinated campaigns to manipulate the public conversation, to divide people all around the world, to confuse and--and generally to distract and we do have policies in enforcement to prevent as much of this is possible. It is a growing threat and it shows no signs of slowing down. Thoughts are one way that in today's do this. Sometimes it may look like a bot that it's actually a human that is organized with other humans for a particular agenda so it is challenging. We are doing work right now to better identify thoughts on our service. 
WHITEHOUSE: Let me just interject Mr. Dorsey real quick as a baseline proposition do you agree that a bot does not deserve a voice on your platform, that it should be actual people and organizations? 
DORSEY: I don't agree with that as--as a high level. I--I think we should be labeling bots so that people have greater context for what they are interacting with. 
WHITEHOUSE: Fair enough. 
DORSEY: There are--there are plenty of thoughts on our service that provide a valuable function and I wouldn't want to take that away. 
WHITEHOUSE: Let me ask both of you and maybe you can supplement this with an answer in writing for the record because my time is getting short and this is a complicated question but the question is when does it matter to twitter and when does it matter to Facebook to know who the actual entity is that was using your platform? Let me start with you Mr. Dorsey, since Mr. Zuckerberg went first last time and you can defer to a written answer if you would like the cause my time is running very short. 
DORSEY: We--we will add to this conversation with a written answer but I--I do believe that pseudonymity is important. We have seen its usefulness with activist and with whistleblowers and I think that is critical but certainly there are times and it is judged by severity of potential outcomes where we need to dig into an entity and take actions. 
WHITEHOUSE: We will follow up with that and let me just ask you since my time has expired Mr. Zuckerberg to respond or have your organization respond in writing. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Before we--Senator Whitehouse brought up something very important and I want to add this directly as I ask this as directly as I can. To Facebook and twitter do you have any internal research or evidence to suggest that your platforms can be addictive? Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think we can follow up with a summary of research that we have but from what I have seen so far it is inconclusive in most of the research suggests that the vast majority of people do not perceive or experience these services as--as addictive or have issues but I do think that there should be controls given to people to help them manage their experience better and this is something that we are very focused on. 
GRAHAM: Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: I am not aware of internal research but we can follow up but I do think like anything else these tools can be addictive and we should be aware of that, acknowledge it and make sure that we are making our customers so aware of better patterns of usage so that the more information the better here. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Hawley? 
HAWLEY: Thank you Mr. Chairman. In the late 19th century the heads of the biggest corporations in America, the robber barons, got together and they set rates, they set prices, they determined how they would control information flow, they determined how they get rid of competition and I will be darned if we aren't right back there again and except for this time you are the robber barons, your companies are the most powerful companies in the world and I want to talk about how you are coordinating together to control information. 
In recent days, my office was contacted by a Facebook whistleblower, a former employee of the company with direct knowledge of the companies content moderation practices and I want to start by talking about an internal platform called Task that Facebook uses to coordinate projects including censorship. The Task platform allows Facebook employees to communicate about projects they are working on together. That includes Facebook censorship teams including the so-called community well-being team, the integrity team, and the hate speech engineering team who all use the Task platform to discuss which individuals or hashtags or websites to ban. 
Now Mr. Zuckerberg you are familiar with the Task platform aren't you? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we use the Task system for I think it is as you say four people coordinating all kinds of work across the company although I'm not sure if I would agree with the characterization specifically around content moderation that you gave. 
HAWLEY: Well, let's get into that and let me see if we can refresh your memory and provide folks that home watching with an example. Here over my shoulder as an example, is a screenshot of the Task platform and use. You will notice if the cameras assume in several references to election integrity throughout on these list of Task again this is shared across Ace books sites, company locations by working groups. What particularly intrigued me is that the platform reflects censorship input from Google and Twitter as well. 
So Facebook as I understand it Facebook censorship teams communicate with their counterparts at twitter and Google and then enter those companies suggestions or censorship onto the Task platform so that Facebook can then follow up with them and effectively coordinate their censorship efforts. So Mr. Zuckerberg, let me just ask you directly under oath now does Facebook coordinate its content moderation policies or efforts in any way with Google or Twitter? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, let me be clear about this. We do coordinate on and share signals on security related topics. So for example if there is signal around a terrorist attack or around child exploitation imagery or around a foreign government creating and influence operation that is an area where the company do share signals about what they see but I think it's important to be very clear that that is distinct from the content moderation policies that we or the other companies have where once we share intelligence or signals between the companies each company makes its own assessment of the right way to address and deal with that information. 
HAWLEY: Well, I--I am talking about content moderation, I am talking about individuals, websites, hashtags, phrases to ban. Is it your testimony that you do not communicate with twitter or Google about content moderation, about individuals websites, phrases, hashtags to ban? Just yes or no, do you communicate with twitter or Google about coordinating your policies in this way? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we do not coordinate our policies. 
HAWLEY: Do your Facebook content moderation teams communicate with their counterparts at Twitter or Google? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not aware of anything specific that I think it would be probably pretty normal for people to talk to their peers and colleagues in the industry-- 
HAWLEY: It would be normal but you don't do it? 
ZUCKERBERG: No, I--I am saying that I--I'm not aware of any particular conversation but I would expect that some level of communication probably happens but (INAUDIBLE) different from coordinating what our policies are or our responses in specific instances. 
HAWLEY: Well, fortunately I understand that the Task platform is searchable so will you provide a list of every mention of Google or Twitter from the Task platform to this committee? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, that's something that I can follow up with you and your team after on. 
HAWLEY: Well, yes or no I am sure you can follow up with a list but why don't you commit while I've got you here under oath? It's so much better to do this under oath. Will you commit now to providing a list from the Task platform of every mention of Google or Twitter? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, respectfully I am without having looked into this I'm not aware of any sensitivity that might exist around that so I don't think it would be wise for me to commit to that right now but-- 
HAWLEY: So that's a no. How many items on the Task platform reflect that Facebook, twitter, and Google are sharing information about websites or hashtags or platforms that they want to suppress? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I--I do not know. 
[*]HAWLEY: Will you provide a list of every website and hashtag that Facebook content moderation teams have banning on the Task platform? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, again, I would be happy to follow up with you or your team to discuss further how we might move forward on that, but without understanding (INAUDIBLE)-- 
HAWLEY: Just will you commit to it here? Senator Cruz and Senator Lee both asked you for lists of individuals, website, entities that have been subject to content moderation. You expressed doubt about whether any such information exists, but you've also now said that the Task website--you've acknowledged the Task platform exists, that it is searchable. So will you commit to providing the information you have logged on the Task website about content moderation that your company has undertaken? Yes or no? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think it would be better to follow up once I've had a chance to discuss with my team what any sensitivity around that would be that might prevent the kind of sharing that you're talking about. But once I've done that, I would be happy to follow up. 
HAWLEY: All right. So you won't--you won't commit to do it here. We could, of course, subpoena this information. But I'd much rather get it from you voluntarily. But I think let everybody take note that Mr. Zuckerberg has now repeatedly refused to provide information that he knows that he has and has now acknowledged that he has that Tasks has under oath. Let me--let me switch to a different topic. Mr. Zuckerberg, tell me about CENTRA. What is the Facebook internal tool called CENTRA? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not aware of any tool with that name. 
HAWLEY: Well, let me see if this refreshes your memory. There is a demonstrative now over my shoulder. CENTRA is a tool that Facebook uses to track its users, not just on Facebook, but across the entire internet. CENTRA tracks different profiles that a user visits, their message recipients, their linked accounts, the pages they visit around the web that have Facebook buttons. CENTRA also uses behavioral data to monitor users' accounts, even if those accounts are registered under a different name, and you can see a shot here, a screenshot provided to us, of the central platform. 
We blocked out the user's name in the interest of privacy, although you can see this individual's birthdate and age when they first started using Facebook, their last login, as well as all manner of trackings. How many different devices have they used to access Facebook? How many different accounts are associated with their name? What accounts have they visited? What photos have they tagged, and on and on and on. Mr. Zuckerberg, how many accounts in the United States have been subject to review and shut down through CENTRA? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do not know because I'm not actually familiar with the name of that tool. I'm sure that we have tools that help us with our platform and community integrity work, but I am not familiar with that name. 
HAWLEY: Do you have a tool that does exactly what I've described and that you can see here over my shoulder? Or are you saying that that doesn't exist? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I am saying that I'm not familiar with it, and that I would be happy to follow up and get you and your team the information that you would like on this. But I'm limited in what I can--what I'm familiar with and can share today. 
HAWLEY: It's always amazing to me, Mr. Chairman, how many people before this committee suddenly develop amnesia. Maybe it is something about the air in the room. Let me ask you this. When a Facebook employee accesses a user's private information, like their private messages or their personally identifiable data, is a record made of that, Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Sorry, Senator could you repeat that? 
HAWLEY: Is a record made of any time a Facebook employee accesses a user's private information, personal identifiable information, for example messages? Is a record made any time a Facebook employee does that? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I believe so. 
HAWLEY: Does it trigger an audit? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think sometimes it may. 
HAWLEY: How many audits have been conducted? 
ZUCKER: Senator, I do not know the exact number of audits on the top of my head. 
HAWLEY: Can you get a list? 
ZUCKER: Senator, we can follow up on that to see what would be useful here. 
HAWLEY: Will you--I'm almost finished, Mr. Chairman--will you commit to giving us a list of the number of times Facebook employees have accessed users' personal account information without their knowledge? Yes or no? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we should follow up on what would be useful here. It is of course in the operations of the company if someone reports something, it's sometimes necessary for people at the company to go review and understand the context around what is happening when someone reports something. So this is fairly frequent, and as a matter of course. We do have security systems that can detect anomalous patterns to flag, but we should follow up in more detail on what you're interested in. 
HAWLEY: Mr. Chairman, I'll just say, in closing, that what we have here is clear evidence of coordination between Twitter, Google and Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg knows he has the tools to track this, but he won't--he either doesn't remember or won't commit to letting us see it. We have evidence of Facebook tracking its own users all across the web. Mr. Zuckerberg won't answer questions about it, can't remember the name, isn't sure if a tool was deployed in this way and won't commit to giving us basic information. 
I submit to you that this is both totally unacceptable and totally predictable because it is exactly what these tech companies have done to the American people and to Congress for years now, which is why it is time we took action against these modern-day robber barons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Senator Klobuchar. 
KLOBUCHAR: I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'm, as you know, the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Subcommittee, and I'm going to take a little different approach here than Mr. Hawley did when it comes to competition policy because I understand why they might be coordinating when it comes to security. What I want to focus on is what I think we're seeing all over this country, not just in tech. We're seeing a startup slump. We're seeing more and more consolidation. And throughout history we've seen that that is not good for small businesses. It's not good for consumers. And it's not good for capitalism in the end. 
Even successful companies, even popular companies, and even innovative companies are subject to the antitrust laws of this country. When I asked Mr. Pichai about this at the Commerce Committee hearing a few weeks ago, he said he told me Google was happy to take feedback, and my response was that the Justice Department already provided feedback in the form of a federal antitrust complaint, and I know there is investigation reportedly going on out of the FTC right now regarding your company, Mr. Zuckerberg. 
So I want to start with exclusionary conduct regarding excluding smaller competitors by limiting interoperability with the Facebook platform. The investigation that we saw in the House recently gave us a number of examples of companies, excluded companies including Vine, Stackla, MessageMe and Arc (PH), and my view is this conduct, exclusionary conduct, not only damaged the ability of these smaller businesses to compete, but it deprived customers of convenient access. You're one of the most successful companies, biggest companies in the world, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook. Do you think that this is fair competition or not with regard to the interoperability and how you've conducted yourself with these other companies? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm generally strongly in favor of interoperability and building platform and API access for companies to be able to access. That's why we built the Facebook platform in 2007. Some of the policies that you mentioned, I think came about because what we were seeing was not necessarily startups, but larger competitors like Google and some of our Chinese rivals from trying to access our systems in order to use their scale to compete with us better, and it just felt to us like at the time that that wasn't the intent of what we were trying to enable. It's worth noting-- 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay, well we may have a non-Chinese example here. I just want to know--I know that the--maybe we could hear from Mr. Dorsey, and I have concerns about Facebook's treatment of Twitter subsidiary, Vine. It's my understanding is that once Facebook recognized Vine as a competitor after Twitter acquired it in 2013, it cut off Vine's ability to interoperate with Facebook so that Vine users couldn't upload their videos to Facebook. And then I think that Twitter shut down Vine in 2016. 
Mr. Dorsey, could you tell me about the actual impact of Facebook's actions on Vine's business, on Vine's ability to compete and on your decision to shut down the service? And I know you're not a Chinese company. 
DORSEY: Well, I don't know about the intent on the other side, but I know our own experience was we found it extremely challenging to compete with Vine, and ultimately decided that the ball moved past us, and we shut it down. Again, I don't know the specifics and the tactics and what was done, but we did find a very, very challenging market to enter, even though we existed prior to some of our peers doing the same thing. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay, I'm going to move to something else quickly. Instagram and WhatsApp, we have some released internal Facebook emails in which you, Mr. Zuckerberg, wrote that Instagram was nascent and if they grow to a large-scale they could be very disruptive to us. And in a later email, you confirmed that one of the purposes of Facebook acquiring Instagram would be to neutralize a competitor. 
[*]KLOBUCHAR: You wrote those emails that were mentioned in that House report, is that right, Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I--I believe so. And I've always distinguished between two things though. One is that we--we had some competition with Instagram in the--and the growing space of kind of camera apps and photo sharing apps. But at the time I don't think we or anyone else viewed Instagram as a competitor as a kind of large, multipurpose social platform. 
In fact, people at the time kind of mocked our acquisition because they thought that we dramatically spent more money than we should have to acquire something that was viewed as a--as--as--as a--primarily a camera and photo sharing app at the time. So, I-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --Okay. Well, I mean, here's the issue-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --I think it's important to distinguish-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --Though. We don't--we don't know how it would've done. And when we look at your emails, a kind of leads us down this road, as well with WhatsApp, that part of the purchase of these nascent competitors is to--I'll use the words of FTC Chairman Joe Simons, who just said last week a monopolist can squash a nascent competitor by buying it, not just by targeting it with anti-competitive activity. 
So, I know that this is a subject of investigation. Maybe we'll be hearing something soon. But I think it's something that committee members better be aware of not just with Facebook, but what's been going on with these deals that have gone through and how it has led to more and more consolidation, and how we as the Senate, and I just talked to Chairman Graham about this last week, could actually do something about this by changing some of the standards in our laws to make it easier to bring these cases and not just involving tech. 
So, I want to go to something here at the end, the political ad discussion we had in front of the Commerce Committee. Mr. Zuckerberg, I know you said that Facebook had made over $2 billion on political ads over the last few years. You--you said this was your--""relatively small part of your revenue."" I know that, but it's kind of a big part of the lives of politics when that much money is being spent on ads. 
This is a bill I actually have with Senator Graham. And yet, we have seen these political ads that keep creeping through despite your efforts to police them on your own. And this is why I would so badly like to pass the anise--Honest Ads Act. One ad that went through, it says, and three battleground states, ballots marked for Donald Trump had been discarded. Poll, will voter fraud only increase closer to November? 
So, it stated in three battleground states, a paid ad, ballots marked for Donald Trump have been discarded. This played between September 29th and October 7th, 2020, had up to 200,000 impressions. Does this ad violate Facebook's policy? 
ZUCKERBERG: Sorry. Can you repeat what the ad was? 
KLOBUCHAR: The ad was an American Action news ad. They've advertised a lot on your platform. And it said in three battleground states, ballots marked for Donald Trump had been discarded. This was pre-election. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I--I don't know off the top of my head if that specific ad violates our policies. I'd be happy to--to follow up-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --Okay. Could you-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --Afterwards on that-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --Would you commit to a policy where actual people's eyes, people could review these ads instead of just being hit with algorithm review? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we--we do have review and verification of political advertisers before they can advertise. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So, does every ad to go through a human being, like the-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --Senator, I don't know if-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --TVs do and-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --Every-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --Hmm? 
ZUCKERBERG: I--I think every--every--our policy is that we want to verify the authenticity of anyone who's--who is doing political or social issue advertising. And I think it's worth noting that our people reviewers are not in all cases always more accurate than the--than the technical systems. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. So, are you saying-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --So, I agree that there is something that's-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --That a human being reviews every ad? It's just really yes or no or I don't know. That's--it's-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --I--I--Senator, I don't know. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. 
ZUCKERBERG: I don't think so. 
KLOBUCHAR: Well, we'll follow up then in the written. And then you brought the cease-and-desist order against NYU for publishing a report that--noting over the last two years Facebook had not properly labeled approximately 37 million political ads. Why would you not support this project? Why would you bring a cease-and-desist against them? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, is that the project that was scraping the data in a way that might have been against the FTC-- 
KLOBUCHAR: --That's your definition, but it's-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --FTC consent decree that we--that we have to protect people's privacy? 
KLOBUCHAR: The reason is happening is we haven't passed the Honest Ads Act, but--so, they're trying. They're not violating privacy. They're trying to get the ads so people can see the ads, other campaigns, journalists, every one. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, you know that I support the Honest Ads Act and--and agree that--that we should--that we should have that passed, and even before that that we've implemented it across our systems. But I think in the case that you're referring to, that project was scraping data in a way that we had agreed in our FTC consent decree around privacy that we would not allow. So, we have to follow up on that and--and make sure that we--we take steps to--to stop that violation. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Last, Mr. Dorsey, do you think there should be more transparency with algorithms as part of this is not just--and I'm off of the ads now. I'm--I am on just generically. 
Part of this is that people don't know how this data is going across the systems and across the platforms. And people basically are buying access, has been my impression, so that even if you say, like, what's the news in the last 24 hours, old stuff comes up. Something's gone awry from the beginnings of this. Would it be helpful, do you think, if there was more transparency with algorithms? 
DORSEY: I--I do think it would be helpful, but is technically very, very challenging to enforce that. I think a better option is providing more choice to be able to turn off the algorithms or choose a different algorithm so that people can see how it affects one's experience. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Thank you. And I ask that both of you look at the bill that Senator Kennedy and I have, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, to help the content providers negotiate with digital platforms. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Tillis? 
TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for joining. Mr. Chairman, I know you've asked the question a couple of times about whether or not these platforms can be addictive. I--I think they probably can be, based on what I've read in--in one of two ways. They could be just the nature of the personality and engagement in a tool that can--that they can somehow relate to. But I also think there is a transactional addiction. 
And I think you also mentioned Social Dilemma. I think that's the use of analytics, which I don't criticize, among the--the platforms, but it's the use of analytics to addict you to go down a certain path to produce a certain outcome. And that could either be an outcome forming an opinion or an outcome buying something you didn't even think about 30 minutes before you started going down that path. So, I think there are things that we've got to look at, and I do agree with Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey. It's not conclusive, but common sense would tell you it's a--it's a problem already and it could become a bigger problem. 
Mr. Zuckerberg, we--I--I'd like to go back to the--the Task platform for a minute. When I looked at the--the screenshot that Senator Hawley put up, it looked a lot like a work management tool. Can you tell me a little bit about that and how many people are actually engaged as users on that platform at Facebook? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes. Thank you. I--I was a bit surprised by Senator Hawley's focus on our Task system, because all this is, it's a--of the basic internal project management tool. It's exactly what--what the name sounds like. It's used by companies--by--by people across a company thousands of times a day to assign projects and--and track them. It's used for all manner of different types of--of Tasks across different people and teams. 
TILLIS: And do you know roughly how many Facebook either contractors or--or full-time employees are actually users of the Task platform? 
ZUCKERBERG: I think that probably the majority of Facebook employees and people we work with have some interaction with the Task system as--as part of some part of their work. It's--it's basically just a companywide to-do list. 
TILLIS: The--the other platform that Senator Hawley mentioned was the CENTRA platform. You said you weren't familiar with that one, but I think that is something that would be helpful, maybe as a follow-up, to really understand the nature of that platform. I won't pressure on it today because you said you weren't specifically familiar with the name of the--the tool, but I would be more interested in how it's used. 
But Mr. Dorsey, does Twitter have a platform similar to the Task platform for work management communication among staff? 
DORSEY: Absolutely. I mean, a--a--even the smallest companies use these tools. We use a tool called Jira. 
TILLIS: Yeah. I was involved in implementing these in--in my time technology sectors, so I could see why you have these platforms. 
But Mr. Zuckerberg, you mentioned you didn't think there was a systematic coordination between Google and Twitter but you could conceive of how people in similar professions you know may have a discussion, have a relationship, maybe talk about it over a beer or so could you see why--how the skeptic could see how these platforms could be used across platforms to force certain outcomes? 
Let's say you had 100 people at Facebook, 100 people at Twitter and 100 people at Google that all had a political event, they get together, they share notes and then they go back and make decisions that could make it appear like it's a corporate initiative but it could be an initiative by may be some well-intentioned but misguided staff. Could you at least conceive of that being possible? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I--I understand the concern and I think that coordination specifically on writing the policies or enforcement decisions could be problematic in the way that you are saying which is why I really wanted to make sure that it was clear that what we do is share signals around potential harms that we are seeing whether it's you know specific content in the aftermath of that terrorist attack that people are trying to share virally so that way if one platform is seeing it another platform can be prepared that they will probably see that content soon, to; you know signals around foreign interference in elections but I think it's quite important that each company deals with those signals in the way that is in line with their own policies and that I think is very different from saying that the companies are kind of coordinating to kind of figure out what the policies should be. 
I understand what the concern would be around that and that is why I wanted to be clear about what we do and don't do there. 
TILLIS: No, I agree with that I would find it horribly irresponsible to think that this was some sort of a systematic approach across the platforms but just with the sheer numbers of people that you all employ now I could see how some of what has been suggested here in the hearing could actually occur with just small groups of people trying to manipulate certain outcomes. You know I don't want to get into details there except to know that these--the Task platform if it is similar to ones that I have experience with has a lot of logging has a lot of data to where maybe you could do yourself a service by saying you know I hear what has been suggested here but in analyzing the interactions between groups of people and seeing may be some aberration some people being more active and more geared towards one outcome or another it could actually help you a leave some of our concerns with the way these platforms are being manipulated. 
I'm not going to have time to drill down into some of the specific questions. I am glad to hear that you all are open on some regulatory outcome. I will tell you if you listen to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today I fully expect that Congress is going to act in the next Congress, that we are going to produce an outcome and some people think that that's not possible because maybe the Republicans and Democrats are far apart but if you listen to what they are asking you they are concerned with the kind of outcome that they didn't like on social media in equal measure. 
So I do believe that you would be well served to come to the table as--as an industry and identify things. Mr. Zuckerberg I like what you have said about transparency and Mr. Dorsey I do think that the algorithms when you talk about the sheer scale are probably the most sustainable way to go but we are still going to have to have some confidence. I like your concept on choice as well but we are going to have to have more visibility into what has occurred and what has produced certain outcomes like a Veterans Day post that I did after the election. It was actually after my opponent had conceded. 
I just posted a picture thanking veterans and for a period of time I think it was suspended and directing people towards election results. I would like to think if that was a result of an algorithmic decision that my opponent who almost certainly posted a veterans ad and every other person who was up for election got a similar treatment because if they didn't it would seem to me that there was some other factor in place if these algorithms are being applied to the base of in that case political commentary from elected officials or candidates. 
So I--I viewed this hearing as an opportunity to seek your commitment on two things. One I mentioned to you all yesterday. I have got an intellectual property subcommittee hearing in the middle of December. I would like to have a Facebook and Twitter representative there. I know you are very different platforms but I think you play very prominently in a hearing that Senator Coons who is sitting across from me now would like to have you represented it. I think I can speak for Senator Coons that that would be helpful and we would like to get your commitment to have witnesses for that hearing in the middle of December. Mr. Zuckerberg, can I get that commitment? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes, we will make sure that we have the right subject matter expert to join your--your hearing. 
TILLIS: Thank you. And, Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: We will follow up with determining the best course of action. 
TILLIS: Thank you and then we will be following up on a series of questions that I would like to ask that let me get my head around some of the analytics information that I think you almost certainly have and hopefully be willing to share it but we will do that in a collaborative way in my office. Thank you for being here today. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. We are going to take a five-minute break. I think our witnesses have requested a break and they certainly have earned it, and if that's okay with you, Senator Coons, we will come back in about five minutes. 
[*]GRAHAM: Do we have our witnesses on the other end? Mr. Zuckerberg? Mr. Dorsey? 
UNKNOWN: We got both. 
GRAHAM: We got both. Thank you. Sorry we went so long with that break. Senator Coons. 
COONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the last four years, we have seen some unprecedented attacks on our Democratic institutions, our social norms, the ways in which we conduct ourselves in this democracy and many would say on--on truth itself. And in today's society, you can't talk about truth without also considering the impact of social media and social media platforms. 
So if I might, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey, free expression and open debate are of course core values of our society, but whether you wished for it or not, the inescapable fact is your algorithms, your policies, and your business decisions shape what billions of people across the world and a working majority of people here in our nation understand to be true. That's the case for election integrity, for potential COVID-19 vaccine, for climate change, for hateful and dangerous stereotypes and many other critical issues. 
I also want to recognize that it in no small part was the hard work of many led by your ingenuity and resolve that built these impressive American companies and revolutionized the way the world communicates. We need that same resolve to reckon today with what must be done to win our societies battle for truth. 
Mr. Zuckerberg, as you know, yesterday I sent you, along with 15 of my--14 of my colleagues, a total of 15 senators, we sent you a letter urging Facebook to do more to address hate speech and calls to violence from the platform. We focused particularly on anti-Muslim bias--bias on an issue that warned specifically specific attention given the tragic consequences of anti-Muslim hate speech in Myanmar and Sri Lanka and New Zealand and right here in the United States. And I appreciate that Facebook has taken actions in response to these issues, but this--this letter points out why we need better metrics and transparency to actually evaluate your actions. 
So my colleagues and I urge better enforcement in particular of your call to arms policy, which could have made a difference in a recent tragedy in Kenosha, Wisconsin. You and I spoke last week. I appreciated our conversation. Can I count on you to provide specific and written responses to each of the questions in this letter and then can we discuss them again? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes. I--I read your letter and I commit to getting back in detail with our team to address the important topics that you've raised and one of your questions that I can actually answer right now, I think it was your second question, about reporting in our--in our quarterly transparency reports about the prevalence of hate speech that we find on our platforms. We will actually be adding that metric into our transparency reports this Thursday when we announce our--our latest round of--our latest transparency report. 
COONS: Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg. Let me--let me just make sure I hear you right about prevalence because that's one of my areas of concern is the absence from the report of the prevalence of hate content. You mean you will be reporting not just what percentage of hate speech on the platform you're identifying, catching, proactively removing, but the total volume? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, it's my it's my understanding is the, yeah, the prevalence of that content is a percentage of content on the platform. And over time, our goal is going to be to get into more detail, which is the subject of some of the questions that you've asked here as well as we've already committed to an independent audit of the community standards enforcement reports so that way people can have full confidence in all of the numbers that we're putting out. And we've been doing this these reports for less than a few years now and will continue to flesh them out and add more details. That way people can--can apply the appropriate oversight and scrutiny to the work. 
COONS: Thank you. I want to move on for a moment if I could about your call to arms policy. You said earlier today that Facebook made an operational mistake in not taking down an event page that called for people to bring weapons to a public park in Kenosha. As I think we all know, there was a tragic incident of vigilantism in Kenosha where a young man brought his AR-15 from Illinois to Kenosha and ended up with two protesters dead and one injured. 
You indicated this was because this operational mistake was because Facebook had just adopted its militia policy a week earlier and contractors without specialized training didn't pick up the violation. And I appreciate your frankness as to that in your answers to questions earlier today from Senator Durbin. 
But your response to Senator Durbin didn't mention that the event page also violated a separate call to arms policy in place for over a year that contractors aren't tasked to enforce. So I just have to ask as a follow up, why didn't you before and also today reference the call to arms policy when reviewing what went wrong in Kenosha? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, my understanding is that that post did not necessarily violate that call to arms policy at the time. The culture arms policy is not--does not prohibit anyone from saying, you know, let's--let's go get our guns and do something. You know, for example if people are organizing a hunting trip, that's obviously not going to be something that should be against the policies. But what we do on some of these--on some of these policies, which I think it's--I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this. 
Some of these are context specific and just require a higher level of context and expertise in the area to enforce. So we don't necessarily have all of the 35,000 reviewers assess every single one of these policies. So I can follow up in more detail if you'd like on the call to arms policy and the nuance there. Specifically, but that's also a bit on how we operationalize these policies. 
COONS: Thank you for that answer. I do want to follow up because just facially, it seemed to me that this was a violation of your own call to arms policy, but I look forward to that--to that conversation. Mr. Dorsey, if I might, at a House Energy Committee hearing I think it was two years ago, you committed to something that I was just discussing with Mr. Zuckerberg, an independent civil rights audit, but in your case, of Twitter. 
The audit released by Facebook in July has proven invaluable to bringing sunlight to some key areas in which Facebook does need to improve. Will you follow through in your commitment and commission to this independent audit of Twitter? 
DORSEY: So we so we work with civil rights groups all over the country and around the world to get feedback. We are in constant conversation with them and we do believe that being more transparent and making our transparency report a lot more robust, which today we still have some gaps is important for any entity to audit independently of us. We believe that's important because an audit like that could take away from the work that we need to do. We'd rather provide the information in a raw format so that people could do that work. 
COONS: If I heard you right, you aren't going to pursue an independent civil rights audit, but you are going to continue to release data and to consult with civil rights groups. I'd--I'd welcome a more thorough answer as to in which way having an independent outside audit would actually harm your transparency efforts. 
DORSEY: I don't mean it would harm it, I mean that we--we want to provide enough information so that people can do this work independently of us on their own timelines. 
[*]DORSEY: And that's where we need to make our transparency report more robust and as I said, we have regular conversations with these groups and take feedback regularly. 
COONS: You do, Mr. Dorsey, have policies against deepfakes or manipulated media, against COVID-19 misinformation, against things that violate civic integrity, but you don't have a standalone climate change misinformation policy. Why not? 
DORSEY: Well, misleading information, as you are aware, is a--is a large problem. It's hard to define it completely and cohesively. We wanted to scope our approach to start to focus on the highest severity of harm. We focused on three areas, manipulated media, which you mentioned, civic integrity around the election, specifically in public health specifically around COVID. 
You know, we wanted to make sure that our resources that we have had the greatest impact on where we believe the greatest severity of harm is going to be. Our policies are living documents. They will evolve. We will add to them. But we thought it important that we focus our energies and prioritize the work as much as we could. 
COONS: Well, Mr. Dorsey, and I'll--I'll close with this, I just--I cannot think of a greater harm than climate change, which is transforming literally our planet and causing harm to our entire world. I think we're experiencing significant harm as we speak. I recognize the pandemic and misinformation about COVID-19 and manipulated media also cause harm. But I'd--I'd urge you to reconsider that because helping to disseminate climate denialism in my view further facilitates and accelerates one of the greatest existential threats to our world. So, thank you to both of our witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Senator Ernst? 
ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey, thank you both for being here with us today virtually and for your commitment to constantly improving the way your platforms are serving people across the country. 
There has been a lot of talk today, many of us have been listening from our offices or online, about the censorship of ideas and news on your platforms. And these are the things that have been at the forefront of Americans mind's in the lead up to the election, as well as the weeks since our 2020 general election. 
And, you know, the people that--that I hear from, of course, believe that conservatives were wrongfully being silenced while those on the left that--were given basically free reign of your platforms. And one of the points of contention that is often brought up is that you do recruit heavily from California, which leads to your employee base skewing quite heavily to the left. 
So, my first question is for both of you. Do you have concerns about your ability to monitor disinformation on both sides of the political aisle equally, given that the majority of your employees typically do lean towards the more progressive side? And again to both of you, have you taken any steps then at all to make your employee base more representative of the country as a whole when it comes to political affiliation? And Mr. Zuckerberg, if we could start with you, please. 
ZUCKERBERG: Thank you, Senator. I think that this is a--those are both really important topics. In terms of assessing what is misinformation, I think it's important that we don't become the deciders on everything that is true or false ourselves, which is why we tried to build a--a program of independent fact checkers that we can work with on this. 
And those facts checkers are accredited not by us, but by the--the independent Poynter Institute for--for Journalism as--as part of the international fact checking network. And it includes fact checkers that I think span the political spectrum, as well as I think the majority of them who--who call themselves apolitical. So, we've tried to address the--the issue of--of making sure that there isn't a bias in our actions by actually having us not be the deciders on that type of content ourselves. 
And to your second question about taking steps to diversify the--the employee base, we--we--we--this is a--a sensitive area and that I don't think it would be appropriate for us to ask people on the way in as they were interviewing what their political affiliation is, which of course makes it hard to know what the actual breakdown of the--the company is on this. 
But one of the areas where I'm more optimistic over time is I think we're going to see more people working remotely around the country and--and also around the world, which will mean that fewer people and smaller percent of our employees will have to come to, you know, the--the see these and--in areas like the Bay Area where our headquarters is, and we'll be able to employee an increasing number of people across all the different geographies in the country. 
ERNST: Very good. Thank you. And Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: First and foremost, the most important thing is that we--we build systems and frameworks independent of any one particular employee or individual in our company. And inclusive in--included in that system are checkpoints, checkpoints to make sure that we are removing any bias that we find, checkpoints to do QA and monitoring of all the decisions that we make, having an appeals process which is an external checkpoint on whether we made the correct enforcement action or not. So, we want to build something that's independent of the people that we hire, and that is our focus building a system. 
Second, like Mark, I'm really excited that we are at a stage where we can decentralize our company even more, that we do not need people to move to San Francisco, that we can hire people all over the country. They can stay wherever they want to be, where they--wherever they feel most creative. And that's not just in this country. It's around the world. 
And I think the tools are in a state where we can do that more easily. We've obviously been forced to do it with COVID. And I don't think it's a--a state that we will return from. With--the days of having one centralized massive corporate headquarter in any one particular city are certainly over for us at least and I think many other entrepreneurs starting companies today. 
ERNST: Yeah, very good. I really appreciate that, and--and I think that COVID has taught us all a very important lesson. And for those to be able to work remotely, I think you will find greater diversity in thought, which is very important, I think, for the types of platforms that you both represent. 
Now, I'd like to move on to an entirely different topic. And since I bolt--began my career here in the Senate, I have been committed to of course protecting those who need it most. And--and folks, our--our children are the most in need, and it's our job as lawmakers to respond to the ongoing threats against them. 
And social media has created a whole new world for--for all of us, and it can help us share that information and resources with the public about human trafficking and child exploitation, and it can also help us keep track of sexual predators and ensure our children are safe from those known threats. And in fact, I've been working on legislation that would help update what information sexual predators have to provide about their online identities. 
And as we all know, however, social media can also be incredibly harmful. Child sexual abuse material, CSAM, is present on nearly every single social media platform that exists. And in such polarized times, I am grateful that it is this subject that we do find--it doesn't matter if you're on the left or the right. We can come together to find solutions for this issue. 
And Mr. Zuckerberg, I know that you and I touched upon this briefly last week will we spoke over the phone. And I do hope, Mr. Dorsey, that you also share Mr. Zuckerberg's commitment to fighting these types of issues on your platforms. 
So, just very briefly here as I'm running out of time, but Mr. Zuckerberg, I do understand that Facebook is planning to out foot--outfit Facebook Messenger with end-to-end encryption. And how do you hope to prevent the dissemination of child sexual abuse material if neither law enforcement nor you can access that Messenger data? Is there some sort of apparatus that you will have in--in place that can help law enforcement with those situations? And then Mr. Dorsey, we'll go to you next as well. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, thank you for this. I think you are--you are right on--on every count of what you just said, both that child sexual exploitation is--is one of the gravest threats that we focused most on, and it is also an area that will face new challenges as we moved to end-to-end encryption across our--our messaging systems. 
[*]ZUCKERBERG: Of course the reason why we are moving to encryption is because people want greater privacy and security in their messaging systems and over time we are choosing systems that can provide them more privacy and security and that is something that I think it makes sense for us to offer. I think encryption broadly is good but it is going to mean that we are going to need to find and develop some new tactics. 
A lot of what we have found around the best ways to identify bad actors on our system is not actually by looking at the specific content itself but by looking at patterns of activity and where is it that so you can flag and review that and we have grown increasingly sophisticated in that, that goes across the foreign interference prevention work that we do and it also will be a factor here and I would be happy to follow up in more detail on what we have planned but overall I would say that this is something that we are very focused on and I--I agree with your concern. 
ERNST: Okay, thank you very much and Mr. Dorsey you as well. So those that are on Twitter making sure that law enforcement would have access if at all possible if you could give me an overview of that please. 
DORSEY: Yes, child exploitation is absolutely terrible and we don't tolerate it on our service at all. We regularly work with law enforcement to address anything that we see inclusive of the patterns that Mark has mentioned. The majority of Twitter is public so we don't have as much activity in private channels so it is a different--a different approach but it is still you know we still see the same activity and we--it is one of our highest priorities in terms of severity of harm. 
ERNST: Thank you both very much for being accessible to us today. I truly appreciate your input. Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you and Mr. Zuckerberg I really want to appreciate what Facebook has done in the area of sexual exploitation of children. You all have done a very good job of trying to help law enforcement in that area. Senator Hirono? 
HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg for the second time in three weeks you have been called before the Senate committee so my Republican colleagues can beat you up over claims that your platforms are supposedly biased against conservatives. The fact of the matter is that these allegations are completely baseless. 
Everyone who has systematically looked at the content on social media from Media Matters to the Cato Institute to former Republican Senator John Kyl has found absolutely no evidence of anti-conservative bias and data from proud to tangle(SP) showed that far right content from the likes of Fox News, Ben Shapiro, David Bongino dominates the daily top 10 most engaged pages on Facebook so all of these allegations about the fact that you hired or all of your employees are left of center is relevant of nothing, certainly not relevant on some sort of anti-conservative bias in terms of your content moderation. 
So the way I see it this hearing is a transparent effort by my Republican colleagues to work the refs and unfortunately in my view it is working. Two weeks ago the Washington Post reported that Facebook has bent over backwards to avoid claims that it was biased against conservatives and it removed a strike against Donald Trump Jr's Instagram account that would have penalized him as a repeat offender. Currently one of several strikes removed from the accounts of Trump family members. For Trump's super PAC, American First Action, was allowed to post material rated false by Facebook's third-party fact checkers without penalty and these are just a few examples and they are nothing new. 
In 2019 Facebook included Breitbart a website described by its co-founder as a platform for the alt-right as one of its trusted news sources. Early in 2019 Facebook selected the Daily Caller another site with white nationalist ties to being one of its third party fact checkers and the Wall Street Journal has reported how Joel Kaplan(SP) former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush stopped changes designed to make Facebook's algorithms less divisive because the changes would have disproportionately effected conservative users and publishers according to Kaplan. So Mr. Zuckerberg you founded Facebook, a company with a market capitalization of approximately $80 billion, and you control majority share of the company's voting stock. 
Mr. Zuckerberg I am really wondering at what point--at what point you will stop giving into baseless claims of anti-conservative bias and start exercising your control over Facebook to stop driving division and actually build community and bring the world closer together"" as you claim is Facebook's mission. My question is to both of you. A recent Harvard study found that President Trump was the single biggest source of voting related misinformation in the run-up to the presidential election. Since the election President Trump has only continued the lies on Twitter and Facebook falsely claiming that he won reelection and that the election is being stolen from him. 
But the truth is Joe Biden won the election as major news networks and the Associated Press have confirmed. In response to President Trump's lies you have at most added a warning label while still allowing the presidents misinformation to remain online. In response to questions from Senator Feinstein you defended the labels claiming you appoint people to a broader conversation around the election. I have serious questions about the effectiveness of these labels particularly since President Trump and his allies continue to spread their lies. 
For both of you, what evidence do you have that these labels are effective in addressing President Trump's lies? Response please. 
DORSEY: So and I think Mark mentioned this as well earlier we are doing a retrospective on the effectiveness of all of our actions through the election. We believe the labels point to as you said a broader conversation that people can see what is happening with the election and with the results. We don't want to put ourselves in a position of calling and election, that is not our job so we are pointing to sources and pillars that have traditionally done this in the past and that is the intention of the policy, that is the intention of the labeling system. 
HIRONO: Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we view the additional context that we put on the post as part of an overall response effort to make sure that people have reliable information about--about the election so we don't expect that it's just going to be when people are seeing a post that may be casting doubt on a legitimate form of voting or may have misinformation that we can correct and help people understand how they could really vote for example so that is why we put the voter information's enter prominently on the top of Facebook and Instagram four months leading up to the election and kept it up afterwards so people can see reporting on the results. 
As I mentioned in my opening statement 140 million Americans visited that and I think this was the largest voting information campaign in the history of our country so I think when taken together these actions were quite strong of an effort to communicate accurate and reliable information to people at the times when they needed it about how they can vote in the election, encouraging them to vote, having confidence in the election system, knowing who and--and when the election had been called. That's just part of an overall system. 
HIRONO: My time is running out and so all of the information, the actual information of voter information you provide that is good but we are talking about all of these misinformation and actually outright lies put out by the President and you have these labels and I really have questions as to whether or not this kind of labeling and I'm glad that at least Mr. Dorsey is determining whether these labels do anything to actually create a larger framework for discussion. 
I really seriously consider beyond a doubt whether that is actually happening. Since I am running out of time I just wanted to get to, you know Donald Trump is president do consider post get on (PH) whether they contain misinformation especially whether he won the election and COVID, you name it the fraudulent elections that he alleges. What are both of you prepared to do regarding Donald Trump's use of your platforms after he stops being president? Will he still be deemed knows newsworthy and will he still get to use your platforms to spread this misinformation? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, let me--let me clarify my last answer we are also having academic study the effect of all of our election measures and they will be publishing those results publicly. In terms of President Trump and moving forward there are a small number of policies where we have exceptions for politicians under the principle that people should give to hear what their elected officials are saying and candidates for office but by and large the vast majority of our policies have no newsworthiness or political exception. 
So if the president or anyone else is spreading hate each or inciting violence or posting content that delegitimizes the election or valid forms of voting, those will receive the same treatment as anyone else saying those things. And that will continue to be the case. 
[*]HIRONO: Remains to be seen. Mr. Dorsey? 
DORSEY: Yeah, so we do have a policy around public interest where are our global leaders we do make exceptions in terms of whether if a tweet violates our terms of service, we leave it up, but we leave it up behind and interstitial and people are not--not allowed to share that more broadly. So a lot of the sharing is disabled with the exception of quoting it so that you can add your own conversation on top of it. So if an account--somebody becomes--is not a world leader anymore, that particular policy goes away. 
HIRONO: So I am running out of time, but you know, I have--Mr. Chairman, I'd like to enter into the record a number of studies, particularly on November 1st 2020 article in the Washington Post titled Trump Allies Largely Unconstrained by Facebook's Rules Against Repeated Falsehoods Submit Pre-Election Dominance, a May 26 2020 article in the Wall Street Journal titled Facebook Executive Shut Down Efforts to Make the Site Less Divisive, three studies from Media Matters finding no anti-conservative bias on Facebook and an article by Dr. Francesca Tripodi titled No, Big Tech Isn't Silencing Conservatism. I would like to enter these items into the record. 
GRAHAM: Without objection. Senator Kennedy. 
KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, each of you has founded an extraordinarily successful company. And they're both American companies and I think I would be remiss if I didn't say congratulations. I'm very proud of the fact that it was American ingenuity they did this. 
I think we can also both agree that both Twitter and Facebook have enormous power as a result of your success. You're not--you're not companies, your countries at least in terms of power. I want to--I want to test a point of view here. I'm unsure I subscribe to it, but I want to get your thoughts on it. Mr. Dorsey, do you believe everything you read? 
DORSEY: No. 
KENNEDY: Why not? 
DORSEY: I think it's healthy to have skepticism about everything and heavy mindset of verifying it and using as much information as possible to do so. 
KENNEDY: Do you have somebody on your staff who protects you from reading things that they think you shouldn't? 
DORSEY: No. 
KENNEDY: Mr. Zuckerberg, do you believe everything you read? 
ZUCKERBERG: No, Senator. 
KENNEDY: Why not? 
ZUCKERBERG: Because a lot of things are incomplete or incorrect. 
KENNEDY: So you exercise your own judgment? 
ZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator. 
KENNEDY: Okay. Do you have somebody on your staff whose job is to filter things that they think you should not be reading? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, not--not externally, although I would hope that the teams that I work with internally do their best to make sure that the information that they're presenting me with are always accurate. 
KENNEDY: Okay. I want to--here--here is a point of view. I'm not sure I subscribe to it, but it is a legitimate point of view I think. And I'd like to know your thoughts on it. You have both, and this is directed to each of you, you have both Democrats and Republicans upset with you. 
The Democrats are upset with you, this point of view holds, because they want you to publish, I'm not using that word as a--as a term of art or science here with any special meanings. The Democrats want you to publish stuff on your platforms that they agree with but they don't want you to publish stuff that they disagree with. 
And this point of view also holds that the Republicans are upset with you because they want you to publish things on your platforms that they agree with, but they don't want you to publish stuff on your platforms that they disagree with. What if we had a rule--what if your companies had a rule, this is a question, not a suggestion, what if your companies had a rule that said okay, people aren't morons. I would like to treat people as they treat me. That is that I can read what I want to read and exercise my own good judgment about whether I choose to believe it. 
So here's the rule we're adopting. If you go on Twitter or Facebook, you can't bully people, you can't threaten people, maybe this is a subset of both of those, but you can't commit a crime with your words, and you can't incite violence. But other than that, you can print any damn thing you want to and we'll let our users judge. Give me your thoughts on that. 
DORSEY: Those are generally the rules we have. I mean, our--our focus on these policies, Senator-- 
KENNEDY: --No you don't, Mr. Dorsey. Excuse me for interrupting, but you're censoring like right and left trying to make both sides happy and you're making neither side happy. 
DORSEY: No, that's not the intention. The intention is to-- 
KENNEDY: --I know it's not the intention, but it's--the intention, but it's the result. 
DORSEY: I can see why you might say that and why you might perceive that, and that's why we--we, you know, we do think it's important that we add more transparency to how we moderate content, that we give more control to individuals to moderate their own content and focus on out rhythms. But a lot of our policies are focused on making sure that people feel that they can express themselves in the first place and not driven away. Everything you mentioned about bullying, about harassment around illegal content or violence, incitement of violence, that is what our policies are and that is our intent-- 
KENNEDY: --I know. And excuse me for interrupting, but my time is limited because--and I want to hear from Mr. Zuckerberg, but you're not just doing that. You're--you started to censor content. Why not have both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump able to say whatever they want to on their platform? Mr. Zuck--so long as they don't threaten, bully, incite violence, commit a crime? 
I'm not justifying the use of either Twitter or Facebook to--to hurt the Rohingyas. Mr. Zuckerberg, what are your thoughts on--on my suggestion? Get out of the censors that business other than the exceptions I talked about. 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, in principle, I agree with what you're saying, although I think that there are more categories of harm then just the ones that you've mentioned. So--but I think the basic principle behind what you're saying is a--a definition of free expression that says that people should be able to share their opinions broadly except if it's going to cause imminent or irreparable harm to another person, which, now, even the most ardent First Amendment supporters, you know, agree that you shouldn't be able to yell fire in a crowded theater if there's not actually a fire, right, because that could be put people in the risk of imminent harm. 
So you mentioned terrorism, you mentioned Child Exploitation and bullying is forms of harm and I think a lot of the debate is around what are other forms of harm. For example, we are in the middle of a pandemic and--and we've assessed that misinformation about COVID and treatments that could put people in additional risk of getting the disease or not seeking the right treatment if they have it that those are also things that could cause imminent harm. We've taken the position that (INAUDIBLE)-- 
KENNEDY: --Mr. Zuckerberg, let me interrupt you and I really do apologize, but I'm going to be cut off in a second, and appropriately so. I'm not saying you're wrong by doing what you just described, but that makes you a publisher. 
[*]KENNEDY: And that--that--that creates problems with section 230. And I--I just think it--one point of view is that at some point we--we've got to trust people to use their own good judgment to decide what they choose to believe and not believe and not--not--not try to assume that we're smart and they're stupid and that we can--we can discern believable information and information that shouldn't be believed, but everybody else is too stupid to do it. 
GRAHAM: Okay. 
KENNEDY: I'm done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: I think you put your finger on a really--maybe the central issue, Senator Kennedy. It's how do we let people make up their own minds without what they're saying creating violence or threats to others, a very complicated endeavor. Senator Booker? Senator Booker? 
BOOKER: Thank you, Chairman. Can you hear me, Chairman? 
GRAHAM: Yes. And to our witnesses, we have two more senators and we'll be done, and I appreciate your patience. Senator Booker? 
BOOKER: I--I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman and have appreciated listening to this--to this hearing. I really want to bring just focus back to what I think is why we're here, which is the 2020 election. And I've been saying in this committee for many months now about the--the tragic consequences of us normalizing things that should express considerable outrage. 
There's not a person on this committee on either side that doesn't know who the next president of the United States will be. President-Elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be the president and vice president of the United States come January 20th. But what is going on right now is dangerous and it is a threat to our democracy. 
For the first time in American history, we are seeing a sitting president of the United States make wild and baseless accusations that undermine the democratic process, that don't just delegitimize it. What the president of the United States is doing is trying to thwart our democracy. As we speak, Donald Trump is waging an all-out war on the truth and our democratic systems. 
And one of his weapons of choice in this disinformation war is social media and specifically the two gentlemen here, their platforms, Twitter and Facebook. You have the tools to prevent him from weaponizing these platforms to degrade our democracy and our democratic institutions and to cause such damage that, even after January 20th, it could be one of the first times that millions of Americans think and believe that this election was what is baseless--baselessly being charged by Donald Trump. 
And so, let's be clear on what's happened. Donald Trump's shameful and shameless lies that are persisting about voter fraud and the outcome of this election were some of the most engaged content on social media in the days after the election. By one measure, during the week after the election, his post on Facebook made up all, every single one, of the topmost--top 10 most engaged post in the United States, and 22 out of 25 of the topmost engaged posts in our country. 
And his number one post, the top of them all, was a false declaration of victory. On Twitter, his false--his--his tweet on falsely claiming victory was viewed by millions of users. This was and is not just a disinformation campaign by the president of the United States, but literally the most powerful person in our country doing an all-out assault on the constitutional ideal of a democracy that he was sworn to protect. 
So, let's take a step back because I--I--I'd think this would be bipartisan if we look to what was happening in another country, if--if we saw--and I'm on the Foreign Relations committee, and I know how we come together on issues like this. If a strong leader--a strongman leader of a democracy had denied his loss in an election, in a democratic election, made consistent in constant baseless claims about fraud, if he fired military leaders while his foreign minister talked about a smooth transition of the defeated leader's next term even potentially in jest, any government looking at this situation, including hours, would be putting out statements urging calm and calling for the peaceful transition of power, for the rule of law, for the honoring of democratic norms and traditions. 
And so, we're seeing concrete consequences right now of President Trump's rhetoric. We are actually in the midst of the fourth-largest mass casualty event in American history. This is not just something that should not be treated with calm and normalcy, but we all, people who believe in this country, should be standing up and talking about the consequences. 
We have his political appointee, the general service administrator, refusing to designate Joe Biden as President-elect and provide the transition team the resources mandated by federal law. It wasn't that long ago that the 9/11 commission said that one of the things that undermined our ability to meet the terroristic threats to our country happened because of a transition that was undermined--or, excuse me, the--a transition that did not happen in the normal course. 
President Trump's actions since Election Day should shock all of us, all of us who care about the welfare of our democracy, who care about our norms. And I hope the platforms here can maintain the highest levels of vigilance. 
And so, to the gentlemen before us today, I'd like to ask specifically have you taken any steps to modify your platform's algorithms to ensure that blatantly false election disinformation posted by election officials and specifically the most powerful person in the United States, Donald Trump, isn't amplified, that his posts that might get a lot of interactions that are dead wrong don't somehow get boosted by your algorithms, if you could both respond to that as quickly as possible? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'll--I'll go first. And--and I share your concern on this and I--I think it's unfortunate that we had to put in place a policy around premature or false declarations of victory. But--but we had to do that, and we--we anticipated this back in September when we put the policy in place. 
And a lot of what we're trying to do is help distribute reliable information, which we attach both to posts on the topic by--by President Trump or any of the other candidates for--or elected officials who--who are talking on the subject. But more importantly, we put that reliable information, including about election results, at the top of Facebook and Instagram for everyone to see. And that supersedes, you know, what--what the algorithm or what newsfeeds chooses to show. 
BOOKER: Okay, I--I--I appreciate that. I--I'd just like to get Jack's--this is information I know--Jack, if you want to just respond on the algorithm--excuse me, Mr. Dorsey, if you want to respond about the algorithms too, do you have specific measures that you're taking to prevent your algorithms from boosting false content? 
DORSEY: Yes, sir. So, many of the labels did change how they algorithms amplify content. 
BOOKER: And then, you know, President Trump right now is spreading dangerous misinformation about our electoral process. That's going on right now. And--and maybe if you guys--gentlemen would just cogently--through this process, this ongoing process right now, are there steps you will be taking that--that you have not already delineated as we are going into what could be very dangerous waters, unprecedented waters in this country? 
Is there any additional steps that you will be taking right now in the coming days or weeks to stop the further amplification and undermining of our--of our--of our democracy? We are--we are heading potentially--depending upon the behavior of a president who shown himself to be erratic, are there steps that you are prepared to take in the--in the coming days and weeks to address this misinformation that we are seeing as coming in an unrelenting manner? Mr. Zuckerberg? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes, we're--we're--we're--this is unfortunately an eventuality that we--that we planned for. And we've taken a number of steps not just including the fact checking program that--that we have set up broadly, but we've stopped recommending all civic and political groups, as an example, because of the risk of misinformation or--or--or harm growing there. We have temporarily caused a political ads because of a risk of--of potential abuse or kind of inflaming tension or--or potential unrest or--or violence. 
And there are number of other steps that we've taken like this as well that we've done in other countries when there are risks of civil unrest and that we've shown-- 
BOOKER: --Thank you-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --Have worked. So, I--I'd be happy to follow up in-- 
BOOKER: --Yes-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --In some detail on all of the steps-- 
BOOKER: --I appreciate-- 
ZUCKERBERG: --That we're taking there. 
BOOKER: Thank you. Your team has--has been helpful. Mr. Dorsey, any new steps that you want to give me? And I'm now treading on the indulgence of the chairman, if you could do really cogent new steps? 
DORSEY: We are going to continue to remain diligent around our enforcement of civilian integrity. I think it is really important that we stay agile and that we learned. We need to learn about like the effectiveness of this work and how to carry it forward. 
BOOKER: Right, and--and if the chairman would indulge me in one more sort of question to Mr. Zuckerberg I was really pleased that the group Stop the Steal, which was a group formed on Facebook with this information trying to delegitimize the election, I was grateful that you all suspended that account after 24 hours but I am concerned about what lessons you have learned because clearly outside groups like the Center for Countering Digital Hate flagged that groups' post containing calls to violence hours before Facebook did. 
And I am wondering what--what you all have learned about speed. There's an old saying that a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its pants on. What does Facebook really factor in in terms of speed and trying to combat surges of disinformation about this group and--and maybe another example additional sort of addendum to that question Mr. Zuckerberg you know Mr. Bannon's Twitter for example permanently suspended Mr. Bannon's Twitter account and suspended his shows Twitter account after he made her rend this steps about acts of violence against Dr.--Dr. Fauci and FBI director Wray. 
But not only had I guess I am just simply asking why would Facebook not take similar steps and a similar stand so Mr. Zuckerberg very cogently could you talk about that speed issue and then I--when your platforms diverge I--I am really wondering why one platform in Twitter saw that as a standard to remove but you all have left--did not follow in that decision. 
ZUCKERBERG: Thanks, Senator. I am happy to address both of those. On speed you are certainly right that that is important and part of what we focus on is figuring out which types of messages or things that are going to go viral quickest because you--it's not just about trying to get to everything within you know five hours for example it's actually much more important to get to the harms that are going viral quickly within an hour even if some things that are probably not going to get much distribution at all might be de-prioritized for a little bit longer. 
So I think making sure that we stay on top of what are the hashtags, what are the groups, what are the messages, who are the bad actors who are trying to spread this content and as we see the thready evolving we are typically able to devolve and move faster as well so we are very focused on that. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Anything-- 
BOOKER: Mr. Chairman if I could ask you I just want to give you an amen Chairman Graham the second part of back question I would love to get on the record but I just want to say to you, you mentioned earlier and I know you said that Chairman Graham will be chairman again but I think you really said something really important earlier about the effects of social media platforms on our kids universally I can cite many studies like the University of Pittsburg we said that kids were on social media at about twice the rates of eating disorders and image concerns. 
I just real would really say and I know the two gentlemen there would welcome the opportunity to come and discuss that perhaps with other experts but there is something really going on in terms of the self-esteem and well-being and even flourishing of our children who are deeply affected by these platforms whether you want to use a typical term like addiction or not there is enough evidence that these platforms and the children's engagement on them is causing heightened levels of sort of a deleterious effect on their well-being and I would love it if we could do such a hearing sometime soon. 
GRAHAM: We will follow up and to the ever patient Senator Blackburn thank you very much. 
BLACKBURN: Thank you Mr. Chairman I-- 
GRAHAM: Last but certainly not least. 
BLACKBURN: That is correct and I appreciate that and even though my colleague from New Jersey went twice his time I am going to-- 
GRAHAM: These are Senate minutes. 
BLACKBURN: Yes they are Senate minutes. I will agree with my colleagues who have talked about the impact on children. The distribution of information that damages women and children that leads to violence against women and children human trafficking, the utilization of these platforms by pedophiles this is something that we are going to continue to work on. When I was in the House we passed legislation to put more tools in the hands of local law enforcement to fight this but you all at these social media platforms are going to have to do your part to work with us on this to protect our children. 
I will also say that we are keeping an eye and with each of you yesterday I talked about your financial components where there for Mr. Dorsey and Libra with Mr. Zuckerberg and the application of these components to your sites. We are talking about 2020 elections but we are also looking ahead to how we clean up some of what transpired in the '20 and before the 2022 elections. 
I think it's fair to say to that you all probably are now fully aware that there is great frustration with the Americans and with this committee with the way you act invincible, the way that your employees act as if you are the invincible gods of the Silicon Valley Facebook and Twitter don't get to be the last word in what counts as real news in this country even though you are beginning to conduct yourself as news publishers and distributors. 
My colleagues and I have ask you all repeatedly through the years for greater transparency and to accept responsibility you have chosen to do neither so it is going to be up to us to change existing law and to hold you to account on behalf of the American people section 230 the reforms that we are going to put in place will take away this liability shield that you have turned into an opaque wall that you and your content moderators whether they are algorithmic or human beings or a combination are hiding behind and the online freedom and viewpoint diversity act I thanked Chairman Graham and Chairman Wicker for working with me on this. 
This is set up for a markup in this committee on Thursday and Mr. Zuckerberg you were stating earlier that we needed to put some definition in place. We are going to do that. We are going to take away nebulous language and we are going to be specific unlawful, and citing personal harm, inciting terrorism, we are going to do that in clear that up for you. 
Mr. Zuckerberg Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company is a statement that you have made, there's a lot of power in that for you so yes or no on a couple of questions here. Does Facebook routinely censor a user's account at the behest of a foreign government yes or no? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator I am not sure there's anything in particular you are referring too bad in general we--we-- 
BLACKBURN: Well, there is something in particular that I am referring to and I will answer yes, you have done that. You have 16 million users in Vietnam of course this is a communist regime, under the orders of the Vietnamese government did a's book shut down and ban the account of the Vietnamese dissident because he criticized the government's land policy yes or no? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not familiar with all of the details of that but I believe that we may have done that and then in general we try to follow the local law. 
BLACKBURN: Yes, you did, and you kept him off for three months. In Turkey, does Facebook have been anti-blasphemy policy where it will take down photos of the prophet Mohammed if the Turkish government orders it to do so? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, again, we don't have a policy against that but we-- 
BLACKBURN: Well, the answer is yes. 
ZUCKERBERG: Well we--we follow local laws-- 
BLACKBURN: The answer is yes. 
ZUCKERBERG: (INAUDIBLE) 
BLACKBURN: In Russia under pressure from the Russian government did Facebook take down a post advertising the rally in support of the dissident Alexei Navaly? And the answer is yes, I will help you with that. Do you believe it is Facebook's duty to comply with state sponsored censorship so it can keep operating doing business and selling ads in that country? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, in general we tried to comply with the laws in every country where we operate and do business. 
BLACKBURN: Okay and I think that you prioritize profit over principle. When you look at these countries and also in communist China which they have banned their citizens from you. You can't operate there. In--in China, Twitter, you have an opponent there. You've got a knock off. Weibo, that is a Chinese Communist party owned company, but your companies, even though they're banned there, you're still trying to do business in those countries. Mr. Dorsey, does Twitter do business with Huawei? 
DORSEY: I don't--I don't believe so, but we can follow up. 
BLACKBURN: Oh, I can answer it for you, sir. You helped launch Huawei's Mate 3 Pro 5G and it is featured on Twitter's marketing page website. How about Alibaba? You do business with Jack Ma's company with their links to the Chinese Communist Party? 
DORSEY: If--if by business you mean allowing people to advertise on our platform-- 
BLACKBURN: --Your answer is yes. Mr. Zuckerberg, are you aware that last year, China stopped Internet regulator agreed to spend over $800,000 for the communist mouthpiece, the People's Daily and they did this so that they could advertise and promote China to the American people on Facebook? The point of all of this--and the answer to that, Mr. Zuckerberg, whether you're aware or not is you probably are and you know that what they're doing is gaining access to this market. 
This is why we're going to keep it real close watch over what you all are doing with Libra and what you are doing with--with Square because we see what has happened. It's important for us to protect people and to protect human rights. And your election--let me move to election content and that monitoring because we do have concerns about some of the things that happened there. Mr. Zuckerberg, let me ask you this. Have you heard of the Trump Accountability Project? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I'm not familiar with that. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. That is a project that is an attempt to blacklist Americans who have served in the Trump administration and to prohibit them from gaining future employment. Now, in communist China, in Putin's Russia, in totalitarian states, the government regularly will issue a blacklist on their enemies. Enemies of the state are banned from getting a job. And if their names fall on the blacklist, their out. 
Now, this seems disturbing that it would be happening here in this country. So Mr. Zuckerberg, do you agree with me there is seriously something wrong with an un-American blacklist tarring people from future employment simply because they belong to a different political party? 
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I generally agree that people should not be discriminated against because of a political belief. 
BLACKBURN: Okay, that is a positive step. Now, on Facebook, I wrote in a post, and I'm quoting, ""The Trump Accountability Project is the epitome of the cancel culture. Our nation has long benefited from robust political debate and this effort to silence those who support our president is vile."" 
As you can tell from this statement, nothing was said about the election or the results either directly or indirectly. But somehow, I got slapped with your elections flag sticker. So what each of you need to realize, and you've heard it time and again today, you say you don't keep lists. Obviously, you have lists because there are some of us who are regularly censored and called down by your content moderators. 
Do we want to see these lists? Yes. How have you built these lists? We want to know. I would remind each of you, you are a title one service. You are an information service. You are to be the new public square. But what you are doing with your power that you have derived because federal law gave you the ability to stand up and grow without being hit by lawsuits, you have used this power to run amok. 
You have used it to silence conservatives. You have used it to build your lists. You have used this power to act like you hold all the power, that you can make these decisions, you have driven this cancel culture because you have not called to account your moderators. You have refused to take responsibility for your employees and their actions. 
So thereby, reining you in on the issues of privacy, data security, content moderation, liability protections, defining who is the publisher in the virtual space. That is up to us because you have proven you do not have the will, the strength, the ability and you will not accept the responsibility to do it for yourselves. I yield my time. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator Blackburn. To the two witnesses, you made it through. I think you hopefully will understand a little bit better about where the committee is at in our concerns. I want to thank you for appearing. I wish we could do it in person, but I can understand why we had to do it remotely. 
We will have more hearings coming up in the next Congress I'm sure to try to find ways to modify 230 to deal with some of the issues that were brought before the committee. I just want to thank you both and just say that you have been hugely successful in ways probably beyond your own imagination--beyond your own imagination and we've got problems around your platforms that have to be dealt with and we will do it hopefully collaboratively. 
The bottom line is we want to make these platforms better, we want to continue to grow this part of our society responsibly, and right now, without regulation or without lawsuit is pretty much becoming the wild, wild West and I appreciate both of you for being willing--being willing to try to find ways to come up with a systems that will ensure more transparency, more choice, and more confidence and-- 
BLUMENTHAL: --Mr. Chairman? 
GRAHAM: Yes, sir? 
BLUMENTHAL: If I may just add my thanks to the witnesses and also to you for having this hearing. I think there is one certainty here, which is that Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Dorsey will be back. They will be back in the next session of Congress. I hope that joining them will be Google and Amazon and others who should be held similarly accountable. And-- 
GRAHAM: --I agree. And to these two companies, thank you for stepping up to the plate. And to the other companies, you need to be here also. 
BLUMENTHAL: And I--I, again, I thank them and we need to have greater accountability by reducing the shield that's now nearly complete. And I want to thank you, senator Graham, for working with me on the EARN IT Act. A number of our colleagues have raised the problem of child sexual abuse material. The best way to counter it is to act. 
GRAHAM: Sure. 
BLUMENTHAL: When you really are serious about all this rhetoric and the jumble of grievances that we've heard, let's begin the journey with a single step. We can do it through the EARN IT Act. It's on the floor of the United States Senate having been recorded unanimously out of this committee. Let's have a vote. 
GRAHAM: Agreed. Change is going to come. Thank you. The hearing is adjourned. "

SPEAKERS:
 UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL SPOKESMAN STEPHANE DUJARRIC 
[*]DUJARRIC: All right. Just a little COVID update here for us at Headquarters. As you may know, yesterday we were informed by a permanent mission that they had five positive cases among their staff. The UN Medical Service immediately initiated contact tracing with the full cooperation of the permanent mission. As of now, all in-person meetings have been suspended for today. I do expect a bit more information to be shared later this afternoon, and a note to our staff will also be going out shortly. 
Turning to the Security Council, Geir Pedersen, the Special Envoy for Syria, spoke to Council members via videoconference today from Beirut. He described his recent visit to Damascus, including his meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Walid al-Muallem. He said he will seek to deepen his dialogue with the Syrian parties and key players in the months ahead in the reviewing where we stand on [Security Council] resolution 2254 (2015) and seeking to identify how best to develop a wider process. 
Mr. Pedersen noted that Syria's front lines have not changed in recent months and that the number of civilians killed during that period has, according to monitoring groups, been the lowest since 2011. But he warned that the situation in Syria, including the involvement of foreign militaries in continues to be tense. 
Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock also briefed the Security Council on the humanitarian crisis in the country. He said that he was alarmed of the violence and insecurity affecting civilians and aid workers and he called for their protection, as shelling in front-line areas in the north-west, as well as air strikes in Idlib, have continued. Mr. Lowcock also updated the Council on the humanitarian impact of the economic crisis, humanitarian access and the assistance being provided by humanitarian organizations across [Syria]. 
Turning to Tanzania, which is preparing for general elections on 28 October. In a statement we issued yesterday, the Secretary-General called on all national stakeholders to ensure that the polls are conducted in an inclusive and peaceful manner. He recalled that an inclusive electoral process and a broad effective participation of political parties and their candidates, particularly women, remain essential for safeguarding the progress made by Tanzania in consolidating stability, democracy and development. 
The Secretary-General urged all political leaders and their supporters to participate in this exercise peacefully and to refrain from violence. He calls on the authorities to provide a safe and secure environment, which will allow Tanzanians to exercise their civil and political rights. 
The Secretary-General, in another statement we issued, said that he is following with great concern the violent incidents which have occurred in Afghanistan over the past several days. These incidents have claimed the lives of 40 civilians and injured many others, many women and children. 
The Secretary-General strongly condemns the suicide attack that targeted civilians at an education centre on 24 October in Kabul, which killed at least 25 civilians and injured 50 more, most of them young students. He recalls that deliberate attacks against civilians are serious violations of international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes. He said those who carry out these crimes must be held accountable and that we stand in solidarity with the people and Government of Afghanistan. 
A couple, two other notes on Afghanistan, where our humanitarian colleagues inform us that heavy fighting that started on 11 October between the Afghan National Security Forces and a non-state armed group is continuing near Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province, south of the country. Local authorities initially estimate that 35,000 people were displaced. Along with our humanitarian partners, we are still trying to verify these numbers, with nearly 9,700 displaced people confirmed to date. 
The violence has stretched hospitals in the town to capacity. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 15 health facilities have been targeted, impacting thousands of people obviously. We are closely coordinating with the Government and our partners on the ground to provide assistance to the people who need it. Local authorities, through the support of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), continue to supply water in displacement locations. Food aid is also being provided. Overall, 6 million people had been reached with humanitarian assistance under the 2020 Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan since the beginning of the year. 
And last note on Afghanistan: a new report released by the UN Mission in the country (UNAMA) shows that the number of Afghan civilians killed and injured in the conflict has failed to slow since the start of the intra-Afghan peace talks, yet the overall civilian casualty figures for the first nine months of 2020 dropped by around 30 per cent compared to 2019. More information is online. 
And in some parts of Yemen are showing acute malnutrition rates among children under 5 that are the highest ever recorded there, with more than half a million cases in southern districts. That's according to a food analysis released today by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP), along with some of our partners. 
The analysis - which is for 133 districts in southern parts of Yemen that are home to 1.4 million children under the age of 5 - reveals a near-10 per cent increase in cases of acute malnutrition in 2020.? 
At least a quarter of a million of pregnant or breastfeeding women are also in need of treatment for malnutrition. Experts warn the actual number is likely higher, as the drivers of malnutrition in Yemen have worsened in 2020. In order to save lives and avert a further worsening of the situation, we are appealing for more than $50 million to urgently scale up nutrition programmes, including treatment for children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. At the same time, funding is also needed to scale up food, water, sanitation and health programmes, including immunization. 
In response to the continued escalation of conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the World Health Organization today said that it is delivering shipments of medical supplies, consisting of trauma and surgical kits, to Armenia and Azerbaijan. WHO said that emergency supplies arrived in Yerevan on 23 October and those destined for Baku are currently in transit. 
The supplies include trauma kits, with each containing medicine and provisions necessary to ensure the post-traumatic care of 100 injured people. Provided to the ministries of health in Armenia and Azerbaijan, they are used across public health systems to deliver care to those in need. Of course, we reiterate our call for an immediate cessation of hostilities in the conflict zone. 
Today, the Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, joined with the African Union Commission Peace and Security Commissioner, Sma?l Chergui, arrived in the Central African Republic. They will be joined there by the President of the Economic Community of Central African States Commission, Gilberto Verissimo. Their three-day visit is intended to advance peace and stability in the country in the context of the upcoming elections, the first round of which are scheduled for 27 December. 
They will meet with senior Government officials, political parties, civil society, and women's groups to call for collective engagement to ensure the holding of credible and inclusive elections, as well as the implementation of the political agreement signed by the Government and 14 armed groups in February last year. 
Mr. Lacroix, as you'll recall, just wrapped up his visit to Sudan yesterday, where he took part in a tripartite meeting with the Government of Sudan and Commissioner Chergui and was joined by Atul Khare, the Head of the Department of Operational Support for the UN. They discussed the support and cooperation of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) as it draws down and how best the UN can assist as the peace agreement is implemented. 
Quick note from Ecuador, where our UN team there is led by Resident Coordinator Lena Savelli and is working with authorities to address the impact of the pandemic. The team has been focusing on small and medium companies to keep them open and safeguard jobs. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), UNHCR [United Nations Refugee Agency] and the UN migration agency (IOM) have launched a digital start-up initiative that has reached over 120,000 businesses with guidelines on how to boost their capacity to deliver their products and services online. This also targets migrant and refugee workers. 
For its part, UNFPA [United Nations Population Fund] is co-financing a $4 million initiative with the Government to work with authorities on recommendations for maternal care, delivery, post-partum and contraception information, to meet the family planning needs of Ecuadorians. And they're also supporting the authorities' response in the northern and southern borders, including in the Amazon region, mobilizing resources for testing kits, personal protective equipment for health officials, and training on sexual and reproductive health for local authorities, targeting half a million people. 
Our friends at the UN Conference on Trade and Development, better known as UNCTAD, revealed in their latest report that global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows fell 49 per cent in the first half of 2020 as compared to last year. This was due to the economic fallout from the pandemic. Developed economies saw the biggest fall in FDI reaching an estimated $98 billion in the six-month period - a decline of 75 per cent since last year. 
Our friends in Bonn at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change announced the winners of this year's UN Global Climate Action Awards. This year's recipients range from the Caribbean's only carbon-neutral hotel in Aruba, to the world's first platform fully dedicated to green bonds and the launch of the first all-women solar team in Lebanon to challenge gender stereotypes in the male-dominated construction sector. More information online. 
And to end on a good note, Cameroon paid its regular budget dues in full, becoming the 131st Member State to do so. Sorry. A lot of stuff today. James? 
QUESTION: Yeah. More on the cases at the Niger Mission. Do we know whether the Permanent Representative has tested positive or anyone else from that Mission who has attended an in-person meeting at the Security Council? Because that would, obviously, make things much more serious. 
DUJARRIC: I am, at this point, unable to confirm the name of the mission, because it's really up to them to come forward. We've been in touch with them, and I expect something to be released from the permanent mission in question soon. What I can tell you is that they have been cooperating fully with the Medical Service and have been in touch with us, and we've immediately launched the contact tracing. 
QUESTION: So, just explain that to us, the contact tracing. Clearly, the Niger Mission to the UN - you won't confirm it, but that's where it is - is not on site here. So, that, I assume, is the responsibility of the City of New York. How does this mesh together...? 
DUJARRIC: Sorry. Let me backtrack. We're talking about the contact tracing for delegates that were in the building and attended meetings. Obviously... so, we're focussed on contact tracing within our community here. Obviously, as everyone else does, people have a responsibility to the host authorities. And we would encourage, as a matter of course, everyone to cooperate with those health authorities. Madame, and then Edie. Celhia? 
QUESTION: Talking about those five cases, how come the UN does not check the temperature of anyone entering the building? Would it be... 
DUJARRIC: No, I'm... listen, I will venture into a field in which I am not an expert, but I don't... I think that would just give you a false sense of comfort. It's not a telltale... a lot of people are asymptomatic, so I'm not... it's not an effective method. 
CORRESPONDENT: I have another question. 
DUJARRIC: Yes, please. 
QUESTION: It's about Afghanistan. In light of the attacks, does the UN still think that it's a good idea to include the Taliban in the Government? 
DUJARRIC: Well, let's backtrack here. There are intra-Afghan talks. It is up to the Afghan people to decide what their future will be. I cannot predict what the outcome of the talks will be. What is important for us is that whatever comes out of these talks guarantees that the gains... the development gains made by Afghan women, youth and other vulnerable groups are not erased, that we do not go backwards, that those rights are guaranteed. Edie? 
QUESTION: Thanks, Steph. A few follow-ups. On Afghanis... on Afghan... well, on Pakistan, does the Secretary-General have any comment on the apparent bombing at this madrasa in Peshawar that... today that killed 8 students and injured over 130 others? And I have some more. 
DUJARRIC: Sure. We, of course, condemn the attack. We join the statement released by UNICEF a bit earlier today in which they condemned the attack. And I think, as UNICEF said, the targeting... schools must never be targeted. Schools always need to remain a safe environment. We extend our condolences to the victims, wish a speedy recovery... send our condolences to the families of those who perished and wish a speedy recovery of those who were injured and stand in solidarity with the people and Government of Afghanistan... of Pakistan. Excuse me. 
QUESTION: And apparently, the Armenians and Azerbaijanis are still going at it despite the third ceasefire attempt. Does the Secretary-General have any reaction? 
DUJARRIC: Well, we continue to express our concern and, frankly, our frustration, I think, at the continued fighting, the reports of continued fighting. As you mentioned, there were three agreements that were... three times, I mean, the parties agreed to a humanitarian ceasefire. It is critical that they actually live up to what they've committed themselves to do. What we need immediately is a ceasefire to ensure that humanitarian aid gets through. If you'll recall a few days ago, we flagged some numbers from WHO which said the cases of COVID-19 had skyrocketed both in Armenia and Azerbaijan. And the Secretary-General's been calling for a global ceasefire. I mean, this is a prime example of humans continuing to kill other humans while the virus wins and... sorry. Go ahead. 
CORRESPONDENT: No... 
DUJARRIC: No, I'm done. 
QUESTION: And just as a follow-up on the no in-house meetings at UN Headquarters today, do we know how long this lack of any in-house meetings will take place? 
DUJARRIC: My guess and my estimate is that we will continue for a few more days. We had... there was a meeting just before I came in with all the relevant in-house parties and Medical Service support, Conference Services. So, we're working on a way forward. Obviously, whether or not meetings... all of this has to be done with the approval of Member States, and I'm sure Brenden [Varma] will have a few more words to say on that from the President of the General Assembly. We have the General Assembly. We have the Security Council. We have ECOSOC [Economic and Social Council]. The Secretary-General's thoughts is that... excuse me. The general... let me try... this has been a long... I think I hurt more than my finger on my bike. For the Secretary-General, it is of foremost importance that staff be safe, that delegates be safe, that you be safe, all those who are coming into the building. 
I think our staff have done a tremendous job during the lockdown of continuing to support Member States in the meetings they've had, continuing to support the work that we do here, that enable us to have some... a minimum of in-house. So, today, the meetings will be virtual. We'll see what happens in the next few days, but I... we should have clarity by the end of today. Mr. Sato, and then we'll go to the screen and then Carla. 
QUESTION: Thank you. Follow-up question. So, do you see any... the... the change of the footprint number in the UN premise from yesterday and today. 
(CROSS-TALK) 
DUJARRIC: Oh, from yesterday and today? I didn't get... we get the screening numbers 24 hours later. So, over the last two, three weeks, it's been about 1,300, 1,400 number of swipes going in every day. By the end of today or early tomorrow morning, I'll have the numbers for today. 
QUESTION: Do you hear any voice from the UN staff, some sense of worry about this case? 
DUJARRIC: Well, we're, obviously, in touch with the Staff Union. We've... our Medical Service has been in touch with them from early this morning. We want to make sure that everyone is safe, that the work of the UN continues as it has. So, as I said, we'll have a bit more details later on. I'm going to go to Benny. 
QUESTION: Okay. Can you hear me? 
DUJARRIC: Yes, sir. 
QUESTION: So, now that he had time to contemplate, has the Secretary... does the Secretary-General, who took note of the agreement between Israel and Sudan, does he think it's a good thing or a bad thing? 
DUJARRIC: I mean, I think if you read the statement that we issued, I think it has a very positive tone to it. Carla. 
QUESTION: Since my last question to you, Honduras has signed the nuc... the treaty to prohibit nuclear weapons, and it's now at entry-into-force stage. Can you explain exactly what that means? Because when I ask... you told me it would be a legal question. I asked Mr. Klein, your friend and my colleague. He said, basically, it has no impact. And since the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is... article 6 is being violated by all the nuclear powers - I say this in all cynicism - what actually... what is accomplished by this... 
DUJARRIC: I think the treaty itself is a very important message on the need for total elimination of nuclear weapons, and I think that's reflected in what the Secretary-General said. Its most immediate effect is that, when it comes into force, which it has [on 22 January 2021; see below], is that the treaty will become binding international law for those States who have ratified it. Those States will also have to submit an initial declaration regarding any past or present nuclear weapons under their control within 30 days of the entry-into-force. The Secretary-General is very well aware of the general climate, and he's consistently called for dialogue among Member States so that they may return to a common vision and a path leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Despite the differences over the treaty itself, the frustrations and concerns that underlie it must be acknowledged and addressed. 
In that spirit, he continues to support... he supports continued engagement between supporters and critics of the treaty. And if I'm not mistaken, I think it enters into force on the 22nd [January]. It's now just been ratified. There's a delay. 
QUESTION: Is there...? 
DUJARRIC: Okay, James... 
QUESTION: Has he made any comment about the fact that none of the party... none of the nuclear weapons...? 
DUJARRIC: I mean, as I said, I would refer to you the statement he issued. I would refer to the past remarks he's made on nuclear weapons. And the Secretary-General, as I said, is fully aware of the general climate and differing positions. Mr. Bays? 
QUESTION: You've made a number of references to the Medical Service here at UN Headquarters. The head of that Medical Service left early on in the pandemic. Is that vacant... is that job still unfilled? 
DUJARRIC: It's under recruitment, but it doesn't mean that the head is vacant, so to speak. We have an acting director, Dr. Bernhard Lennartz, who's been fully engaged and doing a great job with his team. He briefs the Secretary-General every morning. So, I mean, the work of the Medical Service continues. Obviously, recruiting public health officials during this time is not an easy task. Recruiting at the UN is never an easy task, as some may have observed. But it doesn't... in no way it means that the Medical Service is leaderless, on the contrary. Okay. Toby and then Gloria. Toby? Yes. And then I see you, Iftikhar. 
CORRESPONDENT: Sorry, Steph. I didn't have a question, not me. 
DUJARRIC: Oh, good. That's good. Don't think of one. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Iftikhar... Gloria, and then Iftikhar. 
QUESTION: Okay. Mine is the isolated remote indigenous tribes, are they at all affected by this virus, do we know? 
DUJARRIC: Well, I... from what I've read, I know the indigenous peoples are... especially, we've seen in different parts of South America and other places in the world, in different... in the Americas, in general, at high... are vulnerable and at high risk. Iftikhar, and then Abdelhamid. 
QUESTION: Thank you, Steph. My question was asked by Edie, but I want to know whether you will be issuing a formal statement on the blast in Peshawar, Pakistan? 
DUJARRIC: I'll see if there is one, but I think I made the Secretary-General's position clear in the condemnation of this horrific attack on yet another educational facility. We've seen those in Afghanistan. We've seen them in Cameroon. Wherever these schools are, they should never, never be a target. Abdelhamid? 
QUESTION: Thank you, Stephane. I have two questions. When the French teacher Samuel Paty was assassinated, the Secretary-General and the High Representative of Alliance of Civilization both, rightfully so, condemned the killing. However, a few days later, two French Muslim women walking near Tower Eiffel, both were stabbed in front of their children on what is called a hate crime. There was no statement from either... from neither. And also, a mosque was ransacked by thugs in... near Paris, and the prayers were brutalized, and also there's no reaction. I mean, why in one case... I don't want to compare the two crimes. The two crimes are heinous. But isn't there should be some statement condemning the hate crimes, as well? 
DUJARRIC: We condemn hate crimes wherever and whenever they occur. I think on this... and again, I hate to enter into a compare-and-contrast. I don't recall... there was no formal statement after the horrific killing of the teacher in Paris. I was asked a question; I reacted. You're asking me a question on this; I'm also reacting and condemning any and all hate crimes, condemning attacks on religious facilities, on churches, mosques, synagogues. We have repeatedly done that and so has the High Representative. Okay. James Reinl. 
CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Steph... 
CORRESPONDENT: I have a second question. 
DUJARRIC: Oh, go ahead, Abdelhamid. You're allowed. 
QUESTION: Sorry. Can you un-mute me? 
DUJARRIC: No, go ahead. You're not muted. 
QUESTION: Okay. My second question about Palestinian singer, Mohammed Assaf. He was Goodwill Ambassador for UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East] for some time. He's the winner of Arab Idol, and he came and performed here in the United Nations. He used to cross the bridge to the West Bank and perform repeatedly. He's very popular, and he's a nationalist, as well. So, Israel revoked his permission to enter the Palestinian territory for no reason except that he sings sometimes for the cities of Haifa, Acre and Nazareth. Is that a crime, in the view of the Secretary-General? 
DUJARRIC: I have... listen, let me take a look. I had not heard anything about... I remember the person in question, but let me take a look. Okay. I will leave the pod... oh, sorry. James. Sorry, sorry, sorry. James Reinl, yes, and then I'll leave for Brenden. 
CORRESPONDENT: Don't forget about me, please. 
DUJARRIC: No, no. Trust me. You know I couldn't. As much as I can try, it won't work. Go ahead. 
QUESTION: You can try. It's a quick question on the Russian air strike on Turkish-backed forces in north-west Syria. There's been retaliation, ongoing violence today. Mr. Pedersen mentioned it in the Council. Has the SG been in contact with Ankara or Moscow about this? Is there any message to the parties? 
DUJARRIC: The message to the parties is what Mr. Pedersen delivered. I'm not aware of the Secretary-General having contact with the parties on this specific issue. We would... that would be something for Mr. Pedersen. Okay. Brenden, all yours. And we will let you know if we will continue in-person briefings here tomorrow by the end of the day. "

[00:00:45]
Coming up this hour on CNN NEWSROOM, back to square when with record highs. Never before have so many people in the U.S. tested positive for the coronavirus in one day, a sign the outbreak is once again spiraling out of control.
Pandemic? What pandemic? Tens of thousands head to the beach in the U.K. A chance to relax and forget about that global health crisis which has killed almost half a million people and counting.
And former Formula One boss and father to be, 89-year-old Bernie Ecclestone talks to CNN about racing and racism.
The United States is once again in the midst of the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. For weeks, the rate of transmission has been accelerating, and on Thursday, Johns Hopkins University reported 37,000 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. And chances are, it's much worse than that. The Centers for Disease Control says the actual number of infections is likely 10 times the official number. That would mean 23 million people.
Dr. Robert Redfield says, now that there is more testing, it is clear a large percentage of the population have either mild or no symptoms at all. Young people, 18 to 44-year-olds, are testing positive at a higher rate.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR: This virus causes so much asymptomatic infection. We probably recognized about 10 percent of the outbreak. (END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: Infections are rising in 31 U.S. States. Texas and Florida are reporting new daily records. Hospitalizations in California are up 32 percent in the past two weeks.
And the head of the CDC says social distancing remains, quote, ""the most powerful tool we have to fight the virus.""
Chicago is deploying social distancing ambassadors in parks and other public areas.
And in one British beach town, not so much a pandemic but rather pandemonium. Thousands of sun seekers crowded the shores of Bournemouth on Thursday with little regard for the virus. The local council declared it a major incident urging the public to stay away. Get off the beach.
The surge of new cases in Texas is forcing the state to put on hold plans to reopen some businesses. And California's governor is declaring a budget emergency to free up $16 billion to fight the pandemic. We have more details now from CNN's Nick Watt.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
NICK WATT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Partiers backed this Fort Worth bar Saturday night, but the reopening of the Lone Star state is now on hold, as case counts climb at record rates and hospitals fill up.
RON NIRENBERG, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, MAYOR: If this acceleration continues unabated, we will find ourselves overwhelmed.
WATT: Nevada, North Carolina and Louisiana also now pumping the brakes on reopening.
GOV. JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D-LA): I think these numbers meet crystal-clear the correctness of the decision not to move forward.
WATT: In California, Disneyland now won't reopen July 17 as planned.
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): That is an example of the data informing decision-making.
WATT: California and Florida, along with Texas, are reporting record high new case counts. Our three most populous states are going in the wrong direction fast. They are home to more than a quarter of all Americans.
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We've seen most of this case growth in those under 40 category.
WATT: A focus now on efforts to staunch the spread, younger asymptomatic spreaders.
ERIN BROMAGE, UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS, DARTMOUTH: We're seeing the infection rates, especially in Texas, Florida and Arizona, just skyrocketing that demographic.
WATT: Arizona now has the most cases per capita in the entire country.
DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): There is no consideration of increasing activity. Arizona is on pause.
WATT: The CDC just added pregnant women to the at-risk demographics. They say just over 5 percent of women with COVID-19 require hospitalization. For pregnant women, that soars to over 30 percent.
They also now say our actual infection rate might be 10 times the confirmed cases, so not around 2.4 million, but around 24 million. And they say that social distancing is now our most powerful weapon.
DR. WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: The time to normalize wearing masks and social distancing behavior is now so that we get used to it by the time the fall arrives. And I'm very concerned that the second wave this fall will be substantially greater than what we have experienced so far.
WATT (on camera): The number we've really got to keep an eye on moving forward is hospitalizations. How many COVID-19 patients are in the hospital? And here in California, that's gone up by a third in just the past two weeks, a trend that the director of public health here in Los Angeles calls extraordinarily worrisome.
Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
VAUSE: Dr. Shoshanna Ungerleider is an internal medicine physician at California Pacific Medical Center and founder of EndWorldProject.org, and she is with us from San Francisco.
Doctor, thank you for being with us. We take -- we appreciate your time.
DR. SHOSHANNA UNGERLEIDER, INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN, CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MEDICAL CENTER: Thank you for having me.
OK. So so much for that second wave towards the end of the year. Clearly, the virus never went away. I want you to listen to the governor of Arizona with a grim statement about the weeks ahead.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): I don't want there to be any illusion or sugarcoated expectations. We expect that our numbers will be worse next week and the week following in terms of cases and hospitalizations.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: OK. So bad times ahead. The reason why we had the national lockdown, it was to buy us some time so the health system wasn't overrun, so that hospitals could keep up with the people who were infected. Essentially to get ahead of this and to prepare, I guess, for this moment which we were expecting a little later. But are we prepared to deal with this now?
UNGERLEIDER: Gosh, John. You know, it's -- in some places yes, in other places no. I think hitting another record in the number of new cases just today in the U.S. is extremely distressing and points to the fact that maybe we're headed in the wrong direction.
Young people are now the biggest source of cases, as was pointed out, and hospital beds in places like Texas and Arizona are -- are filling up.
There still isn't enough testing and contact tracing happening to find these new cases and isolate them from the general population.
So there's really no question about what's needed here. We need mask wearing in public to be mandatory. We need more testing and contact tracing all over of cases, to find their recent contacts. And anyone with even a slightest COVID-19 symptom or with close contacts with a known case needs to get tested and self-isolate immediately.
And most of all, we need clear, consistent messaging from all of our government officials that supports these efforts.
VAUSE: Yes. That is something which -- you know, we hope for that. It's just not going to happen, it seems, at least on the federal level.
The CDC dropped a few headlines on Thursday, including you know, this belief that the number of real cases in the U.S. could be 10 times the official number of 2.3 million. That's 23 million people.
On the one hand, it's a staggering number, considering what this 10 million cases worldwide, 23 million would be in the U.S. But isn't it in line with expectations? Isn't that a formula they do for countries which have inadequate testing?
UNGERLEIDER: Well, you know, John, I think from looking at the blood samples across the country for the presence of antibodies to the virus, which was what was done, so for every confirmed case of COVID- 19, as you pointed out, 10 more people had antibodies. So these are the proteins in the blood that indicate whether a person's immune system has previously come in contact with coronavirus. So, you know, estimating that around seven percent of the U.S. population or more like 23 million people are walking around either with active infection or recent infection, you know, is really significant.
I think looking at these numbers, taking them very seriously, and then planning accordingly for an increased number that were playing planning to see going forward, is really what we need to be doing right now.
VAUSE: Yes, this time around, compared to the last time with the surge in cases, it seems to be coming with a twist. I want you to listen again to the director of CDC. Here it is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REDFIELD (via phone): I think, obviously, what we're seeing right now, infections that are targeting younger individuals.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: It seems young people were spared for the most part. In Europe they became vulnerable. They're vulnerable as anybody else.
Here in the U.S., it seems that they're the ones who are, you know, bearing the burden of the infections. Is there a simple way to explain how that has transitioned?
[00:10:06]
UNGERLEIDER: You know, not really. I mean, I think that, with widespread sort of community spread, as it's happened here in the U.S., I mean, it makes sense that there are many more cases of young people that are -- that are turning up.
And, you know, the best possible way for young people, for older people, for everybody to reduce the spread of infection is to stay away from other people. So this social distancing being so important.
And, you know, I understand it's summertime. People, young and old, want to be outdoors, enjoy themselves, be with friends and family. People, I think, are tired of staying home.
But the stakes are just so high. We need -- we need people to know that, of course, the virus is invisible. It spreads so easily from person to person via droplets from talking, or from breathing. And when people congregate, even outdoors, much like, you know, what we saw at the beaches in the U.K., and they don't wear masks, this is a recipe for disaster. I think your behavior, every moment, matters. And our actions today put the lives of the people that we love in danger. So I think --
VAUSE: I'm glad you mentioned -- sorry, I'm glad you mentioned beaches in the U.K. Because here's part of a report from CNN's Nic Robinson. Sorry to interrupt, but listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Here in the U.K. authorities have declared a major incident at one of Britain's seaside holiday towns. Why? Because it's not holiday time, but the beaches were absolutely crowded with thousands of people flocking out from what has been a very hot couple of days here.
The concern is that they're not social distancing and the people in that town are not ready for people from other parts of the country to come on vacation.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: You know what if I really incredible? Is that the number of young people I know who heard -- the initial report that came from China that young people were sort of almost immune to all of this, but they've heard nothing since.
UNGERLEIDER: Yes, I mean, I think seeing situations like this, we're probably, in about two weeks, as is the typical lag time between people, you know, congregating and seeing spikes of infections of somebody. You know, if people who are on those beaches, in fact, do have COVID-19, that is the perfect storm, the perfect recipe for disaster.
People being close together, despite them being outdoors, but not wearing masks. Talking, laughing, spending many, many hours with one another. That is how this virus spreads.
And so we need to be talking about what everybody, including young people, should be doing to prevent the spread. Our behavior absolutely matters, and we all have the power to save lives if we -- if we listen and pay attention.
VAUSE: Yes. As you say, just looking at the beaches, it's understandable why people want to be there, but this is not 2019 anymore. So Shoshanna Ungerleider, thank you so much for being with us. Appreciate it.
UNGERLEIDER: Thank you for having me.
VAUSE: Well, the World Health Organization is warning the coronavirus could still overload healthcare systems in parts of Europe.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. HANS KLUGE, WHO EUROPE REGIONAL DIRECTOR: In 11 of these countries, accelerated transmission has led to very significant resurgence that, if left unchecked, will push health systems to the brink once again in Europe.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: Dr. Hans Kluge says the risk of a resurgence in Europe -- in Europe has now become a reality. The 11 countries he mentioned stretch from Sweden in northern Europe, down to Albania in the south, Kazakhstan to the east.
WHO's European region includes central Asia.
In the U.K., a southern coastal town -- we've been talking about flooded with thousands of people, throwing caution and social distancing to the winds and the waves and a good time, raising fears that a surge of COVID-19 cases in England now seems more likely than ever, especially if the lockdown is relaxed in two weeks, as planned.
ITV's Julia Bremner explains.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JULIA BREMNER, ITV (voice-over): The plea was to stay away, but nobody seemed to be listening. Tens of thousands from across southern England and the Midlands descended on Bournemouth today. It was impossible to keep a safe distance from strangers. And there was little or no awareness of any health risks.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why did you come to Bournemouth today?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why? I'm enjoying today. It's really nice weather. Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was a really hot day. I thought I'd take advantage of it by the time the rain goes back. And all of the rules of the lockdown has just been kind of, like, eased on.
BREMNER: With the town overwhelmed and police apparently powerless to intervene, by early afternoon, the council declared a major incident.
VIKKI SLADE, LEADER, BOURNEMOUTH, CHRISTCHURCH & POOLE COUNCIL: What's very obvious is that people don't believe COVID is a problem anymore. That's very obvious from people's behavior.
BREMNER: The M3 was close to a standstill as sun seekers drove from as far away as Birmingham and London. The local conservative MP told me police must be given more powers to deal with the deluge.
TOBIAS ELLWOOD, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: Dorsett can't cope with this. If we need messaging of Waterloo Station or Birmingham's National, or indeed on the M3, there's big signs on the motorway to say Bournemouth is now closed. There is a major incident in play. Please turn around or go somewhere else. If the police doesn't have the necessary powers, we should be operating very quickly in Westminster to give them those powers to deal with this enduring emergency.
BREMNER: To people living close to beauty spots like Durdle Door in Dorset, it feels like an invasion. One councilor trying to turn back vehicles was physically and verbally abused.
LAURA MILLER, DORSET COUNTY BOARD: Unfortunately, he then came back at me through his car window, and fortunately, it landed at my feet. See, the main problem is, the aggression. People traveled four or five hours in a car. And they're hot. They're grumpy.
BREMNER: Along the south coast, they're attempting to stop the crowds, and a second wave of COVID, but it's a battle they fear they may be losing.

VAUSE: Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who's spoken out often about the threat of the pandemic, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper, and Dr. Sanjay Gupta about this latest coronavirus outbreak, just a few hours ago. You can watch that interview and more during CNN's global town hall, ""CORONAVIRUS FACTS AND FEARS,"" a little less than two hours from now, 7 a.m. in London, 2 p.m. Friday in Hong Kong. Only here, on CNN. Well, the coronavirus did not stop thousands of fans from celebrating in the streets of Liverpool. Well, Liverpool ended their 30-year-long wait for the lead title after winning the English Premier League for the first time ever.
CNN WORLD SPORT's Alex Thomas has more now from a joyous Anfield Stadium.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ALEX THOMAS, WORLD SPORT (voice-over): Liverpool's footballers celebrating a moment of history: the club's first Premier League title. Social media video shows them gathered to watch together, as their closest challengers, Manchester City, lost to Chelsea. If they were happy, the fans were ecstatic.
More than an hour after clinching the title, without kicking a ball, the party is in full swing here at Anfield Stadium. We've heard car horns beeping, flares and fireworks being set off. You can see how much it means to these Liverpool fans to be champions of England after an agonizing wait of 30 years.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Long, long wait. It doesn't feel real yet. I mean, obviously, it is real. It's amazing. Just to see it, given we couldn't be on the ground to see us winning it. And hopefully, we'll get to see them lifted up after the game. But it doesn't matter. We're champions, and no one's taken that away from us, now Premier League champions.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's the super club (ph). Is when the young people, 2019. Now, it's just the icing on the cake, winning the Premier League is the run of the moment, (UNINTELLIGIBLE), leading up to the top.
THOMAS: Manchester City had to beat Chelsea to take the Premier League title race into next week, but fell behind to a goal from U.S. Star Christian Pulisic.
City equalized with a stunning free kick from Kevin de Bruyne, regaining the momentum. But Chelsea refused to give it in, winning a penalty, when Fernandinho was sent off for handball.
Willian, scoring from the spot to seal a 2-1 victory that ended City's reign, and gave Liverpool their 19th English championship title, but their first in the Premier League era.
Boss Jurgen Klopp telling Sky Sports he did it for the supporters.
JURGEN KLOPP, LIVERPOOL MANAGER: It's for you all there. It's for you. It's incredible. I hope you stay at home, or go in front of your house if you want, but not -- do not more, and celebrate it. It's all here, and it's all here. We've been doing it together in this moment, and it's a joy to do it for you, I can tell you.
THOMAS (on camera): The local authorities did warn fans to try to stay away from here because of the threat of coronavirus. But you can understand why they wanted a party after waiting so long to be champions of England once again. The team that dominated European, and English football, throughout the 1970s and 1980s are back where they, feel they belong. The best team in this country.
Alex Thomas, CNN, Liverpool.

VAUSE: Well, Formula 1 working to improve its record on diversity. The former boss didn't help a whole lot. Listen to this.

BERNIE ECCLESTONE, FORMER FORMULA ONE CHIEF EXECUTIVE: In a lot of cases, black people are more racist than what white people are.

VAUSE: Yes, what does make him say that? We'll find out in our interview with Bernie Ecclestone in a moment.
[00:21:57]
VAUSE: Well, NASCAR has released an image of that noose found in Bubba Wallace's garage. He's the sport's only African-American driver. Officials say the noose was real. It looked like one they used for lynching. And Wallace had reason for concern.
This comes after the FBI determined that no hate crime had been committed, because the rope had been there, used as a pulley for a garage door, since last year. NASCAR says every other garage has been checked, but Wallace's was the only one with a rope tied into a noose.
Who put it there, and why, remains a mystery.
Formula One will kick off its delayed season in a little more than a week, with the Austrian Grand Prix. Coinciding with the sport's return is a new initiative, to try and improve inclusion and equality.
You'd think that would be something everyone could get behind, but former -- former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone seems to have some different takes on issues involving race. Here's our Amanda Davis.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
DAVIS: Six-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton is the sport's only black driver in its 70-year history. He's often talked about the challenges he's faced in his career because of the color of his skin.
And in the wake of the death of George Floyd, he called out other members of the motor sport community for not speaking up against racial injustice.
He's decided to take matters into his own hands, launching the Hamilton Commission, a research partnership aimed at making motorsports more diverse and multicultural.
And this week, when I spoke to the man in charge of Formula One until 2017, the man dubbed as Mr. F One because of his 40-year relationship with the sport, Bernie Ecclestone, he did praise Hamilton for his actions and talked of its importance for the sport, but he made what I think it's fair to say were some fairly controversial comments.
I began by asking him, why he thinks F1 hasn't done more to tackle the issue of diversity in the past.
ECCLESTONE: I don't think anyone was bothered about it before. They're too busy trying to win races or find sponsors or something. Really, other things are of little, if any, interest.
DAVIS: So what impact do you think what Lewis has launched, the Hamilton Commission, what impact do you think that's going to have in real terms for Formula One?
ECCLESTONE: I don't think it's going to do anything bad or good for Formula One. It will just make people think, which is more important. But I think that's the same for everybody. People ought to think a little bit, and say, Oh, what the hell. Somebody is not the same, not the same as white people. They're black. And the black people should think the same thing about white people. Because I think, in lots of cases, black people are more racist than what white people are.
DAVIS: What makes you say that?
ECCLESTONE: Well, things over the years I've noticed. And there's no need for it.
DAVIS: Is that not a case of fighting for equality and fighting against injustice for such a long time?
[00:25:07]
ECCLESTONE: Well, against injustice, for anyone, whatever color they are, it's important to do something about that, for the start. But as, I mean, I don't think you're going to easily change people's attitude. I think they need to stop being told at school, so they grow up not being able to think about these things.
And I think it's completely stupid taking all these statues down. They should have left them there, take the kids from school to look and say why they're there and why the people did, and how wrong it was what they did.
DAVIS: As somebody who was so integral to making Formula One what it is today, do you not want to see it as a sport leading the way and changing attitudes and portraying society as it is?
ECCLESTONE: Well, I suppose the people that need to do that are the viewer's. For the number of people are directly involved in sport, such a small number of people, can do very little.
I'm surprised if anyone in Formula One, certainly the teams and the people like the promoters, have any concern about this. I think it's the public at large that have to start thinking.
DAVIS: You wonder what the sport's current owners will make of those comments.
Ecclestone, of course, while still an influential figure in the F1 paddock, is no longer in charge. That's the Liberty Media Group run by Chase Carey. They, in recent days, have launched a new initiative to tackle the issues around diversity and inclusion, the We Race as One campaign, including a task force to address the issues both on and off the track.
But set against the backdrop of the issues that Bubba Wallace has faced in NASCAR in recent weeks, now, Bernie's comments, there's no doubt the scrutiny will be greater than ever on Formula One when the delayed season hits the track in Austria, next weekend.
Amanda Davis, CNN, London.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
VAUSE: Well, one reason for the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Texas, scenes like this. Bars are packed and the night life is rocking. Maybe for not much longer, though.
Also ahead, a surging virus and tanking poll numbers. Donald Trump wants to talk about anything but the pandemic, please.
[00:30:08]
VAUSE: Latin America's pandemic death toll has surged past 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. And Brazil, Peru, Chile and Mexico are the hardest hit, by far. First to Brazil and CNN's Shasta Darlington for the latest.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Brazil has reported more than 1.2 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 120,000 new cases in the past three days alone. The death toll is nearing 55,000 and no signs of peaking.
On Thursday, just the state of Sao Paulo surpassed Italy in total coronavirus cases: 248,587.
And yet, several cities in Sao Paulo and across Brazil continue to relax restrictions, reopening stores and shopping malls and heading back to offices, egged on by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly insisted hunger and unemployment could kill more people than the virus itself.
Sao Paulo has even presented its plan for students to start returning to classrooms as of September 8.

VAUSE: Peru reporting nearly 4,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday and has the second highest numbers of confirmed cases in Latin America. Nearly 270,000 have been infected and nearly 9,000 died.
And healthcare workers in one indigenous village in Peru feel like they're fighting all this alone. Deep in the Amazon rain forest, medicines, supplies and other much-needed equipment are hard to find, and nearly everyone, it seems, has fallen ill.
Journalist Guillermo Galdos takes us there.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
GUILLERMO GALDOS, JOURNALIST (voice-over): Eight hours downriver from the nearest hospital, this remote Shipibo village in Peru's central Amazon is struggling.
About 80 percent of this community has COVID-19 and no doctor to care for them. The one doctor they did have abandoned his post when the outbreak began, leaving Elias, a nurse, in charge.
He and two others are doing the best with what they have to care for the 750 people in this village. But it's getting harder every day.
ELIAS, NURSE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
GALDOS: They are so remote, Elias says he doesn't know if or when they will get additional supplies.
After checking on patients in the clinic, Elias goes out in the community to check on those too sick to walk.
(on camera): (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
ELIAS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
GALDOS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
ELIAS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
GALDOS (voice-over): And yet, Elias keeps working. He says he has to keep helping.
He has come to see Raynor (ph), a 32-year-old man who has been sick for the past two weeks.
This is the front line against COVID-19 in the remote Amazon.
ELIAS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
GALDOS: Raynor (ph) has lost around 17 pounds in the past few days, and he still has a fever.
His wife is extremely worried. She has tried to isolate him, but they still share the same hut with their four children.
Caimito is one of the hundreds of thousands in the Amazon now affected by the pandemic. Here, nobody has a bank account. So when the government gave a bonus check to Peruvians struggling to find work during the pandemic lockdown, people in Caimito had to travel eight hours to the nearest bank in Pucallpa, carrying back to the communities more than just money.
It is here in Pucallpa, the capital of Ucayali region, that you find these. People dying at the hospital doors. There are no beds left.
(on camera): This is the COVID area in one of the main hospitals of Pucallpa. Doctors here have to work 12- to 18-hour shifts under 40 degrees Celsius. The heat under these suits is practically unbearable. You feel like the mask is melting on your face.
(voice-over): The hospital is short on staff and running low on oxygen. With only four intensive care beds, the waiting list is long. But only one in 10 in the critical condition will survive.
Back in Caimito, the evangelical church has organized a service. Elias, our nurse, did not show up at the church. He did not agree with social gathering.
[00:35:02]
The next morning, he decides to make his own statement.
ELIAS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
GALDOS: He warns them that, by not respecting social distancing, they are setting themselves up for disaster.
ELIAS: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
GALDOS: And dying they are. Not just here in the remote part of the Amazon but all across Peru. Despite lockdown measures, the daily infection rate is climbing, without an end in sight.

VAUSE: Thursday say almost 6,000 new cases of the coronavirus in Texas, a record for the Lone Star state and a warning shot, says a former CDC director, for other states which have failed to follow guidelines from health experts.
CNN's Lucy Kafanov reports now from Dallas.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The coronavirus nearly killed Christopher Marshall.
CHRISTOPHER MARSHALL, CORONAVIRUS PATIENT: I got so sick that it was acute respiratory distress syndrome with septic shock.
KAFANOV: The 37-year-old University of North Texas graduate student spent weeks at Dallas area hospitals.
(on camera): Do you think you would have died?
MARSHALL: I never would have died. It got that serious.
I'm going home.
KAFANOV (voice-over): Though doctors saved him, Marshall now lives in fear of getting sick again, due to the surge in infections across Texas. He's rarely leaving his home, struggling with survivor's guilt.
MARSHALL: The hardest part for me, initially waking up and saying, how many people have died from COVID-19? Because it's like why did I live? And everybody else died.
KAFANOV: Texas, one of the first states to push an aggressive reopening, is now seeing new cases and hospitalization rates reaching record highs.
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): There is a massive outbreak of COVID-19 across the state of Texas.
KAFANOV: So many getting sick that in Houston, the Texas Children's Hospital is now admitting adult patients.
DR. PETER HOTEZ, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Our big metro areas seem to be rising very quickly. And -- and some of the models are, you know, on the verge of being apocalyptic.
KAFANOV: Minority communities are bearing the brunt of the pandemic. In Dallas, Hispanics account for more than 60 percent of cases. Among them is Dallas ISD Police Officer Vicente Ramirez (Ph), in the hospital for 82 days.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take that COVID stuff serious. I wish I never caught it. I wish I never heard of it. But I tell everybody else, you know, take it seriously.
KAFANOV: The father of six was on a ventilator for more than one month. His brother says Vicente barely survived.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The family was worried about him passing away.
KAFANOV: Bishop Greg Kelly worries most about undocumented patients, many of whom are essential workers.
BISHOP GREG KELLY, CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF DALLAS, TEXAS: They don't have any access to any kind of support, any kind of stimulus support. And so they have to work.
KAFANOV: And it's not just Latinos. Health officials say an increasing number of infections are among young adults like Chris Marshall.
MARSHALL: Stop thinking that you're solely invincible. That you're young and that this cannot happen to you. It can happen. I am 37. It happened.
KAFANOV (on camera): Meanwhile, the governor announcing that Texas is going to hit pause on any further reopening of the economy for now. This, an attempt to slow down the spread of this virus.

VAUSE: What you just saw there in Texas is the here and now reality. While the pandemic, which is only getting worse across much of this country. The virus seems to be on an unstoppable, random killing spree. The young and elderly, the healthy and ailing all have fallen victim.
And while the bodies pile up, it seems the 45th president of the United States is hoping that ignoring the crisis will make it go away.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's like a child who can't believe this has happened to him. All his whining and self-pity. This pandemic didn't happen to him. It happened to all of us. And his job isn't to whine about it. His job is to do something about it, to lead.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: But yet, the president barely mentions the pandemic these days. And when he does, he often uses racial slurs to describe the virus. An attempt, most likely, to distract from reality.
Another reality is that until a vaccine is approved, the most effective way of controlling the outbreak and safely returning to some kind of normalcy is for everyone to wear a face mask in public. And the sad reality is, the U.S. president refuses to do that. One simple act.
The president did not wear a mask during a FOX News town hall on Thursday, no mask earlier in the day at an event to mark the end of the Korean War. And he grows cantankerous when asked why.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
[00:40:05]
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Then why aren't you -- why aren't you further away? And why aren't you wearing a mask?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can take a step back if that makes you comfortable, sir.
TRUMP: You're way -- I mean, you're not social distancing, based on the question.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: Larry Sabato is the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. He is with us from Charlottesville. And it's been a while, Larry, so it's good to see you.
LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: Thank you, John.
VAUSE: This is a president who does not like to read, but he reads poll numbers obsessively. It seems likely he would know this. Pew Research found among conservative Republicans, 49 percent had worn a mask all or most of last month. Sixty percent for moderate Republicans, while 83 percent of liberal Democrats say they've done that. And 71 percent for moderate Democrats.
So surely, the president knows that his actions are one of the reasons why so many of those conservative Republicans are face mask truthers.
SABATO: You'd think so. Certainly, part of it is that Trump is really encouraging Republicans not to wear a mask. Particularly, by the way, male Republicans. Female Republicans and women generally are much more inclined to wear masks.
It's become for him a sign of strength, projecting strength. Projecting masculinity, which has absolutely nothing with proper behavior during a pandemic. But this is Donald Trump were talking about.
VAUSE: Well, the other polls which Donald Trump has no doubt seen comes from ""The New York Times,"" which gives Joe Biden, the Democrat presumptive nominee, a very big lead nationally over the president. That actually would be good if we had one big national election in November, but you know, it doesn't mean anything, because we have 50 elections.
But in those key swing states, Biden has a comfortable lead in Arizona, a big lead in Wisconsin, and not so much a big lead in Ohio but ahead nonetheless. It's probably within the margin of error.
So can these polls be trusted? Are there are secret Trump voters out there who, you know, are unwilling to show their support for the president, because maybe they're a little bit embarrassed or whatever, they just won't tell anyone, but come election day, they will vote for him?
SABATO: Well, look, there might be. Most of the studies of that particular question have indicated that, in fact, there aren't many people who aren't -- who are lying about it.
Some people won't express an opinion. They'll claim to be undecided, even though they are very decided. And I think disproportionately, they would lean toward Trump. So that part's true.
What's important to say, though, is that the Electoral College only becomes critical and can override the popular vote when the popular vote is -- is very close, a couple of points one way or the other.
The polls had better tighten, from Trump's perspective, or he won't need to worry about the Electoral College or slow mail-in ballot counting. It's going to be pretty obvious on election night, if this continues. Oh, it's June. Loads of things could happen between now and November.
VAUSE: Lots of things are happening. And we keep hearing it from the conservative side, at least, sort of mixed messages, if you like, about the masks.
Last month we heard Rush Limbaugh, when all the health experts were urging people to wear a face masks, he told his conservative audience on the radio show that -- that call from those health experts was, in fact, made by ""mask-wearing freaks,"" Democrats who hope to turn the face covers into a symbol of fear.
But then on Thursday, we saw Vice President Pence actually, look, there he is wearing a face mask on a public trip to Ohio.
Contrary to Joe Biden, the Democrat nominee, who's been wearing a public face mask in public since this pandemic began. It's not a big deal, but it sends a big message.
SABATO: I don't endorse candidates, but I certainly will endorse healthy behaviors. And what Joe Biden does is the appropriate thing to do.
Obviously. If you listen to the public health experts, if you listen to the scientists. And there's the difference. Because throughout the Trump administration, scientists and public health experts have been, for the most part, been denigrated. Democrats still put a lot of stock in what they say.
Who knows where that's going? But clearly, there are spikes in places where mask wearing is not very popular, like Texas. The governor there, who's a very conservative Republican, has come around to the view that mask wearing is essential. Now he's being criticized by the right wing of his own party in Texas for giving in to those mask- wearing freaks. Gee, I wonder where that came from?
VAUSE: Good question.
Well, the president was not wearing a face mask, as I said, during that town hall on FOX News. But what was interesting is there was a recent study which actually looked at Sean Hannity, who was the MC for this town hall, and his misleading statements, his half-truths, his lies about the impact of -- and how that impacted the pandemic.
They found greater exposure to ""Hannity"" relative to another FOX News show an hour earlier called ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" leads to a greater number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
It's very complicated the way they did the math. But in other words, there's parts of the country which were slow to act, in this case because Sean Hannity was telling them that it was not as bad as the flu, or Democrats were using it as a political point scorer. And they've seen more severe outbreak and a greater rate of death.
[00:45:11]
If Sean Hannity could have that sort of impact, it's incredible to think, you know, how different this all might be if the president had decided to set a better example from the very beginning.
SABATO: Of course that's true. And this would be a very different situation if the president had acted quicker and listened to his own experts about the pandemic and what needed to be done.
But it is what it is. Donald Trump is not going to change personalities, and he's not going to change his basic characteristics. So this is what we've got, and the voters will have to determine whether they're happy with that or whether they want a mask-wearing president in Joe Biden. It's one or the other.
VAUSE: And there was this -- sort of very quickly, a feedback loop between Hannity and Trump and the White House.
SABATO: Yes, well, they talk all the time. Both have admitted that publicly. Actually, Trump also talks to Tucker Carlson a lot. So, you know, it is a feedback loop, and that's part of the problem.
VAUSE: Yes. OK, Larry, we'll leave it there. We're out of time, but thank you so much. Good to see you.
SABATO: Thank you, John.
VAUSE: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. When we come back, the 14-year- old boy in Belgium taking on a monarch, a murderous one at that.
VAUSE: Well, in the wake of George Floyd's death, past cases of African-Americans killed by police are being reassessed, including the death of 23-year-old Elijah McClain, last August. He was walking home from the mall when he was stopped by police in Aurora, Colorado. Police body cam footage shows how this all began.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop, stop, stop.
ELIJAH MCCLAIN, KILLED BY POLICE: I have a right to walk --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Stop. I have a right to stop you, because you're being suspicious. Turn around, turn around.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAUSE: Police used a chokehold at one point, and then, the drug ketamine to sedate McClain, who later suffered a heart attack and was declared brain dead three days later.
No charges were filed at the time. The state governor, though, has ordered a new investigation after more than two million people signed an online petition.
Demands for correcting the historical record on race have spread around the world, and in Belgium, a country largely unaware of its own horrific past, a teenage boy is taking on a 19th Century king accused of killing millions in Africa. CNN's Scott McLean reports.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For decades, the ugliest chapters of Belgian history have been buried. Out of sight and out of mind. Like this century-old burial ground, just outside Brussels, containing the remains of seven Congolese. Dignity in death was not a luxury these people received in life. They were brought to Belgium to be put on display.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was basically like a human zoo. I mean, they had to do row races on the lake, and the women had to cook, and basically, Belgians came and looked at it. It was pure racism.
[00:50:02]
MCLEAN: That human zoo was commissioned by King Leopold II in 1897.
The killing of George Floyd in the U.S. has opened an old wound in Belgium. King Leopold made Congo his personal possession, sending troops to pillage the ivory and rubber by enslaving the local population. Those who fought back paid with their hands, feet, or lives. At least half a million died.
And yet, today, Leopold is memorialized in street names and statues across Belgium.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
MCLEAN: The visual legacy of a king who reigned for 44 years may will be taken down by a boy who's only been alive for 14.
Noah, born in Belgium to Congolese parents, has got more than 80,000 people to sign his petition, demanding the city of Brussels take down Leopold statues by June 30.
Pierre Kompany was born in colonial Congo, and is now Belgium's first black mayor. He thinks correcting Belgium's problems with racism start with the proper education about the past.
PIERRE KOMPANY, MAYOR: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
MCLEAN: Vandals have already torch the Leopold statue in Antwerp, taken a sledgehammer to a bust in Brussels, and dumped paint on another outside the African museum, which still houses artifacts pillaged from Congo.
Director Guido Gryseels spent half a decade scrubbing its colonial image, but he may soon have a new headache. Several cities and towns are looking to the museum, to give their Leopold-era statues a new home.
GUIDO GRYSEELS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, ROYAL MUSEUM OF CENTRAL AFRICA: We haven't really decided yet whether we want to become a memorial or shrine for Leopold II, or whether we can converted to into some sort of work of contemporary art.
MCLEAN (on camera): So here, you've tried to decolonialize this museum, and yet, you may end up with a colony of Leopold statues?
GRYSEELS: Yes, but it will be in a different context.
MCLEAN (voice-over): Last week, Parliament voted to start a truth and reconciliation commission to atone for the sins of Belgian rule in Africa.
But in response to Noah's petition, the Brussels mayor says he doesn't have authority to remove any statues.

VAUSE: Well, if Americans don't want to wear a face mask for the good of others, soon, they may have another reason. And it's coming from the Sahara.
VAUSE: Well, a massive plume of sandy dust from the Sahara Desert has crossed through the Atlantic and is now covering parts of the United States. The Caribbean has already been blanketed, and blue skies are turning a milky brown haze, like Mexico, on Thursday where the dust set off air quality warnings.
Meteorologist Derek Van Dam, who are you? I remember you. I saw you a while ago. It's good to see you.
[00:55:04]
DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It's been a while.
Yes, John, I find it fascinating that every year around hurricane time, in the Atlantic, we have hundreds of millions of tons of dust that's picked up from the deserts of Africa, blown across the Atlantic.
This occurs on an annual basis, but it's this concentration that has been astounding scientists. In fact, it has darkened skies across Mexico and into Puerto Rico, reduced visibility.
And guess what? This thing is here to stay for at least the next few days across the southeast. And it has the potential to envelop several states with that hazy, milky substance you saw on the imagery you saw just a few minutes ago.
So this is some of the forecast imagery that we see with the Saharan dust. It does peak around late June and lasts right through the middle of August. That is the Atlantic hurricane main development season.
What's happening is, along the western portions of Africa, we get these updrafts that allow for the -- the dust plumes to travel and get lofted well into the atmosphere. It takes a ride on the Jet Stream across the Atlantic, travels that 5,000-mile distance, eventually making its way into the Leeward and Windward Islands, and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it's currently located now.
And here's the latest satellite imagery. You can see that the dust across the southeastern United States, as it stands. Now, it's not going to do much more than inhibit or put a pause on our Atlantic tropical season, but it also is going to allow for hazy skies and perhaps some pretty nice looking sunrises and sunsets, just like we experienced in Houston, as well as some of the shorelines of the Gulf of Mexico.
So this will be a common scene as you scroll through your Twitter feed over the next couple of days across the United States and throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Because that is one of the brighter spots of this Saharan dust layer that is traveling towards us.
It does however, John, have the potential to degrade our air quality, so maybe just gives us another reason to use our masks these days. Right?
VAUSE: Good idea. Good idea. Put on that mask. I don't use Twitter. I think Twitter's mean at times. Anyway, thank you. Appreciate it.
VAN DAM: It's no problem.
VAUSE: It's been a while. Hope to see you again.

11,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_2501/Files (31).DOCX","States News Service",2020-12-30,"16064 words",NA,"States News Service",NA,"GRASSLEY MARKS POLICY, OVERSIGHT ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2020",FALSE,"The following information was released by Iowa Senator Charles Grassley:
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today marked a series of policy and oversight accomplishments of 2020.
""While this past year has been challenging for us all, serving the people of Iowa is my first priority and it's an honor that I take seriously. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and through my extensive oversight efforts, my work focuses on making the government more transparent, efficient and accountable to Iowans and all Americans,"" Grassley said.
Grassley holds at least one question-and-answer session in each of Iowa's 99 counties every year to hear concerns and answer questions on any subject from Iowans. In 2020, Grassley completed his annual county meetings for the 40th year in a row. Grassley holds meetings in a variety of settings to ensure that a broad cross-section of Iowans can participate, including businesses, schools, town hall meetings, hospitals and factory floors. While the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some of Grassley's meetings look a little different this year, the format remained the same: Iowans set the agenda. Grassley moved forward with his meetings in a safe and responsible way while following public health guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the state of Iowa.
In addition to his annual meetings, Grassley attended or convened a variety of events and forums, including:
In 2020, Grassley continued his annual social media series called #CornWatch and #SoybeanWatch. These give followers an inside look at farming operations and to track the progression of corn and soybean crops grown on the Grassley family farm in New Hartford, Iowa, from planting through harvest.
When the Senate is in session, Grassley sets aside at least eight 15-minute meetings every Monday through Thursday to meet with Iowans in Washington, D.C., including advocacy groups, associations, chambers of commerce and local business leaders, students and families. While there were limitations this year due to the pandemic, Grassley was able to meet with Iowans virtually. Throughout 2020, Grassley met with more than 800 groups of Iowans and discussed a variety of policy issues such as trade, tax reform, prescription drug pricing as well as the many issues that have arisen during the pandemic. Grassley also joined Iowa schools for QandAs via video conferencing and, as an avid fan of Iowa universities, cheered on dozens of student-athletes at sporting events.
This year, Grassley became the 10th longest-serving U.S. Senator in history and continued his constitutional duty serving as the Senate president pro tempore, a position historically bestowed upon the most senior member of the majority party in the upper chamber of Congress. Upon his swearing in, Grassley became third in the line of presidential succession following the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives. An Iowan has not held this position since Senator Albert B. Cummins in 1919. In his capacity as president pro tempore, Grassley aided in the selection process of the new Architect of the Capitol and nominated an Iowan to the U.S. Senate Curatorial Advisory board. He also played a role in many historic events this year including welcoming President Donald Trump into the chamber of the House of Representatives for the 68th annual State of the Union address and signing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
Highlights of Grassley's legislative and oversight work follow here:
Agriculture:
This year was particularly tough on the farming industry due to commodity prices taking a hit from the novel coronavirus, drought across West Central Iowa and an intense windstorm known as a derecho that caused widespread damage across central Iowa. However, through it all, farmers continued to plow ahead and support their communities. As the senior senator of one of the top agricultural states in the country and a family farmer, Grassley has been an outspoken advocate for farmers and Rural America.
Throughout the various spending negotiations in Congress, Grassley was a staunch defender of family farms. He led the Iowa Congressional delegation in urging Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to ensure funds for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were replenished in the next government funding bill. He exposed Democrats for blocking crucial coronavirus relief, which included billions of dollars in assistance for farmers and agribusiness employees.
When COVID-19 began affecting our meat supply chain, Grassley immediately raised concerns with his colleagues. Grassley has long focused on consolidation in the meatpacking industry and pressed USDA to protect independent producers. In May, Grassley introduced bipartisan legislation that would foster efficient markets and improve competition and transparency among packers that purchase cattle. Grassley first introduced this bill in 2002. The bill will require a minimum of 50 percent of a packer's weekly volume of beef slaughter to come as a result of purchases made on the open or spot market.
While many around the country noticed higher prices at the grocery store due to these market disruptions, many cattle producers across the country could not get a bid on their animals. Grassley was one of the first lawmakers to seek an investigation to bring more transparency to the cattle industry. He called on the Departments of Justice and Agriculture to investigate potential market manipulation and other illegal activity by large meat packing companies in the cattle industry. President Trump echoed this call for an investigation into possible anticompetitive behavior in the beef industry.
In June, Grassley sent a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue relaying the frustration of farmers about the lack of enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, and called for the report on the Holcomb, Kansas, fire to be released by August 9, 2020, or he would seek an audit of the USDA's enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Division. USDA took this issue seriously and released its report echoing the need for more transparency in the industry. Additionally, he partnered with Sen. Tester in sending a letter to Secretary Perdue recommending the department clarify an ambiguous proposed rule regarding the undue and reasonable preferences provision of the Packers and Stockyards Act.
This year, Grassley also joined Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Securing All Livestock Equitably (SALE) Act. Quick turnaround between the purchase and resale of cattle by a dealer often leaves the rancher who originally owned the cattle with little recourse if a dealer defaults on a purchase because the livestock has often already been resold. The SALE Act would establish dealer statutory trusts, mimicking existing packer statutory trusts, for the purpose of ensuring that cattle sellers receive payment should a livestock dealer become insolvent.
Grassley joined 30 members of Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral letter urging USDA Secretary Perdue to take immediate action to assist pork producers and maintain the pork food supply chain. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, Grassley led his colleagues in sending an additional letter to USDA to recommend additional funding for farmers being forced to depopulate their livestock herds. Farmers faced an animal welfare crisis due to overcrowding and the challenge of providing enough feed and water available to each animal. Grassley also joined Iowa leaders, Sen. Joni Ernst, Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig in sending a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and requested additional support from the Administration for the state's pork producers.
In addition to livestock farmers, Grassley urged his colleagues to support dairy farmers around the country. Additionally, he joined Sen. Ernst, Gov. Reynolds, and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Naig in requesting the USDA to include egg producers and turkey producers in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). In the second round of CFAP payments, both egg and turkey producers were eligible.
To make sure tax dollars are spent as intended to benefit the farmers who actually work the land instead of managers or corporations, Grassley has been a longtime advocate for farm payment limitations. This year, USDA initially announced a final rule on the implementation of payment limitations and the definition of ""actively engaged"" in farming as part of the 2018 Farm Bill, which would have required additional family members to provide either 25 percent of the total management hours required by the operation on an annual basis or perform at least 500 hours of management annually. Unfortunately, USDA recently reversed this rule. Prior to this reversal, Grassley requested an additional GAO review of the program. The GAO report concluded that while USDA has improved its completion of eligibility compliance review, additional oversight is needed. Grassley will continue his fight to close loopholes that have allowed some operations to exploit federal farm payments at taxpayer expense.
Grassley joined the only other farmer in the U.S. Senate, Jon Tester (D-Montana), to address farmer mental health. Grassley and Tester authored the Seeding Rural Resilience Act which aims to curb growing rates of suicide in Rural America by implementing a voluntary stress management training program, creating a public service announcement campaign to raise awareness and directing the Secretary of Agriculture to work with state and local groups to identify best practices when responding to farm mental stress. This bill was successfully voted out of the Senate this summer and later became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.
Diseases like African swine fever have the potential to devastate entire sectors of U.S. agriculture. With that in mind, Grassley cosponsored the Protecting America's Food and Agriculture Act of 2019 to address the shortage of agricultural inspectors who protect the nation's food supply and agricultural industries at the border. This legislation was signed into law by President Trump earlier this year.
This year, the Trump administration kept its promise and successfully rolled back the harmful Obama-era ""Waters of the United States"" or ""WOTUS"" rule and replaced it with a workable rule that clearly defines what waters fall under federal jurisdiction. Grassley was a steadfast opponent of the original rule, which would have regulated 97 percent of Iowa farmland as a navigable waterway. This regulatory certainty will continue to help spur economic growth in Iowa and around the country while also ensuring individual property rights are protected.
Enhancing water quality is critical to meeting the goals of Iowa's Nutrient Reduction Strategy and making improvements to Iowa's river and stream health. With that in mind, Grassley joined Sen. Ernst and a bipartisan group of senators to urge the USDA to make several changes to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to maximize the program's ability for producers to use the program to enhance both soil health and water quality.
Antitrust:
Grassley joined Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to introduce the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules (SMARTER) Act. This bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to go through the same procedures that the Department of Justice (DOJ) must go through when enforcing antitrust law, and would require the Federal Communications Commission to issue merger review decisions expeditiously.
Grassley also partnered with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in introducing the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act which extends whistleblower protections for employees who provide information to DOJ related to criminal antitrust violations. The Senate unanimously passed a similar version of the legislation in 2013, 2015 and 2017. This year, the legislation passed in both the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Trump in December.
In February, when the world was just learning about COVID-19, oversight and investigations staff for Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), received a classified briefing from the HHS Office of National Security (ONS) regarding the coronavirus threat and the status of U.S. government efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus.
Grassley also was named to the bipartisan task force focused on safely re-opening America following the public health crisis. The task force includes Democrat and Republican members of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
Grassley was an original proponent of an emergency supplemental appropriations bill providing funding to combat the spread of COVID-19. The funding package amounts to an $8.3 billion surge in resources to combat COVID-19 and provides comprehensive funding for efforts on the local, state, national and international levels.
In March, Governor Reynolds declared a State of Public Health Emergency as confirmed COVID-19 cases rose. Grassley sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking that he promptly grant the Governor's request for an expedited review of the major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa as a result of multiple cases of COVID-19 detected in the state.
Small businesses across the country were hit particularly hard by associated COVID-19 restrictions. To address this, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act to help keep workers on the payroll by providing small businesses forgivable loans to cover payroll expenses. As the pandemic worsened, Grassley worked with his colleagues to provide additional funding to this program. While the Senate Democrats originally tried to block it, the additional funding later successfully went through. Grassley also worked with the Department of Treasury and the Small Business Administration on clarifying terms and eligibility of the program for Iowa businesses and bankers.
For example, Grassley partnered with Finance Committee Ranking Member, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) urging the Department of Treasury to allow small businesses to deduct expenses associated with PPP loans that are ultimately forgiven. Ultimately, Grassley and many of his colleagues disagreed with Treasury's final guidance.
Grassley worked with his colleagues to ensure the rural economy reaped the benefits of the CARES Act including additional funding for rural health centers, providers, programs, telehealth services and related infrastructure. Grassley also worked to secure relief for American agriculture. He worked to include $23.5 billion in the CARES Act to send emergency temporary relief to farm country to help survive the fall-out caused by the pandemic. Specifically, it set aside $9.5 billion for the USDA to directly support farmers and ranchers. The CARES Act also replenishes the Commodity Credit Corporation with $14 billion. Grassley called upon USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to use some of these additional funds to help support the biofuels industry, including resources for higher blends infrastructure at filling stations and to leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to buy excess farm commodities and replenish food pantries and nutrition programs across the nation. He then introduced legislation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar to make this a requirement.
On December 21, the Senate passed an additional large legislative package including COVID-19 relief and economic stimulus, tax and health care policy extensions and government funding. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley championed several provisions including expanding unemployment insurance benefits, additional economic impact payments for individuals and families and extension of certain expiring provisions for families as well as small- and medium-sized businesses around the country. Additionally, under the Senate Finance Committee's jurisdiction, this package extends a number of important Medicare, Medicaid and other health policies, including boosting payments to doctors in Iowa and other rural areas. It also provides permanent coverage for mental health telehealth visits, which are helpful during the pandemic and will remain critical for many Americans afterward. And, it extends the period over which state and local governments can use money from the Coronavirus Relief Fund provided under the CARES Act by one year, giving more flexibility to state and local governments as they face spending challenges caused by the pandemic. It also provides additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Grassley's full statement on the legislative package and further details on what is included can be found HERE.
Grassley joined Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) to introduce the bipartisan State and Local Coronavirus Relief Fund Extension Act to extend the year-end deadline for states to use federal CARES Act assistance, as well as any future funding to state and local governments, through 2021. The goal of this bill is to provide flexibility in uses of Coronavirus Relief Fund resources by allowing spending by states, localities, territories, and tribes on coronavirus responses to be covered over a longer period of time.
Throughout the funding negotiations, Grassley worked to ensure the COVID-19 relief funds would go to those who actually needed it. With that in mind, Grassley introduced the COVID-19 Funding Accountability Act. This legislation would impose strict congressional oversight over the implementation of various funding in the CARES Act as well as create bipartisan oversight boards.
Grassley criticized his Democratic colleagues when they wanted to impose a quarter of a trillion dollar retroactive tax increase on businesses in need of cash to restart their operations as states began to lift shut-down orders.
Grassley also worked with Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) in introducing a bill to protect recovery payments provided in the recent CARES Act pandemic response legislation from garnishment by private debt collectors.
Grassley has been a longtime watchdog of waste, fraud and abuse. Unfortunately, throughout this pandemic, fraudsters have taken advantage of the American public through a variety of scams. Grassley wrote to the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) encouraging the IRS watchdog to engage in a public awareness and education campaign informing Americans of scams and frauds related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's response.
Grassley also partnered with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to call on DOJ to take vigorous action to protect consumers from price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic and help prevent the hoarding of essential medical supplies.
Although Grassley took all of the appropriate and recommended precautions, the senator tested positive for COVID-19 after learning of an earlier exposure. Grassley quarantined per CDC and local public health guidelines and at the recommendation of his doctors. Due to his quarantine, Grassley was unable to cast votes on the Senate floor for the first time in 27 years. Grassley has cast 8,927 consecutive votes and continues to hold the record for longest length of time without missing a vote in the history of the Senate. Ultimately, Grassley was asymptomatic throughout his quarantine and was cleared to return to work by his doctors.
Crime and Criminal Justice:
All Americans have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including inmates in the state and federal prison system. Grassley and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the lead authors of the bipartisan First Step Act (FSA), led 12 of their colleagues in a bipartisan letter pressing DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to take necessary steps to protect the health and wellbeing of federal prison staff and inmates in Federal custody. They urged the release or transfer of the most vulnerable inmates to home confinement as permitted under the FSA. The senators called on BOP and DOJ to review and expedite current cases where the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program would allow for an early transfer where appropriate of terminally ill and eligible elderly inmates to home confinement. In April, Grassley and Durbin sent a follow up letter to the DOJ Inspector General's (IG) regarding its decision to assess whether facilities housing BOP inmates are complying with available guidance and best practices regarding preventing, managing, and containing potential COVID-19 outbreaks and asked them to expand the probe.
As a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley also participated in a hearing titled, ""Examining Best Practices for Incarceration and Detention During COVID-19,"" where he pressed DOJ and BOP officials on the use of home confinement and adherence to CDC guidelines on social distancing, use of personal protective equipment, and other risk mitigation efforts in correctional facilities.
Also, in an effort to protect the most vulnerable inmates in our society, Grassley and Durbin introduced the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act. This bill expands eligibility for and provides judicial review of the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program, and also provides for the compassionate release of federal prisoners based on COVID-19 vulnerability and shortens the waiting period of judicial review during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Senator Grassley also led a letter to the Justice Department about its handling of COVID-19 in juvenile detention facilities. Along with Sens. Whitehouse and Ernst, Grassley urged the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to equip the juvenile justice system with consistent, reliable, and transparent information to help mitigate the impact of the virus on vulnerable youth.
Grassley continued his work to protect children from predators online through his co-sponsorship of the EARN IT Act. This bill creates incentives for the tech industry to address online child sexual exploitation, by removing blanket immunity in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It also establishes a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention that will be responsible for developing voluntary best practices.
Defense Oversight:
Grassley's extensive oversight work throughout his career has included a dogged pursuit for answers from the Pentagon over decades of wasteful spending and its inability to produce a clean financial audit.
Grassley has conducted oversight to hold the DoD accountable for over four decades. He continued to press the Department on the new Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program, alleged conflicts of interest pertaining to those charged with creating its bid and reported disputes between bidders and the Department. This comes after the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed a review and provided recommendations in response to Grassley and members of Congress raising concerns about the JEDI program. Last year, Grassley sent a letter to then Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, seeking information on Department policies intended to mitigate conflicts of interest and prevent the tailoring of procurement requests to match a specific vendor, as alleged in the JEDI program procurement process.
Grassley and several of his colleagues sent a letter to GAO in July 2018 requesting the agency conduct an independent review of the reasons behind the DoD's failure to acquire modern financial information technology systems capable of generating reliable information and supporting credible financial statements. The report was released in September and reaffirmed Grassley's longtime concerns about financial mismanagement and waste at the DoD. The Department is working towards a clean audit and updating its financial management systems. However, it's clear from this report the Pentagon has a long way to go.
Grassley, along with the other requestors of the GAO report and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), also sent a letter earlier this year to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, urging them to include in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2021 certain provisions that would make progress towards a clean audit, including more detailed reporting to Congress on DoD financial management systems. Both of the provisions were ultimately included in the final version of the NDAA.
Earlier this year, Grassley renewed inquiries into potential wasteful and inappropriate travel spending at the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), specifically seeking full and complete answers to prior questions about multiple trips to Hawaii.
Grassley joined Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to reintroduce the Military Justice Improvement Act in response to reports of mishandling military sexual assaults.
Grassley and Gillibrand also introduced bipartisan legislation to require the military to establish a ""Safe to Report"" policy. According to a Department of Defense report, in fiscal year 2018, only 30% of sexual assaults in the military were reported. Studies show more survivors are empowered to come forward without the threat of retaliation, and the Safe to Report Act empowers survivors of sexual violence to report these incidents without fear of collateral misconduct charges for minor offenses. This legislation was included in the final version of the NDAA.
Also included in the NDAA was a provision that Grassley championed along with other members of the Iowa and Illinois delegation that seeks to improve Army real-estate management. The provision establishes a pilot program to create an online real-estate management system at several Army installations, with the goal of helping the military and federal government use existing resources more efficiently.
Additionally, Grassley expanded his probe into the Department's Office of Net Assessment's (ONA) contract compliance after reviewing troubling documents related to contracts awarded to Professor Stefan Halper. Those documents call into question ONA's stewardship of taxpayer dollars as well as its contract management and internal controls. In early 2019, Grassley requested the DoD Inspector General (IG) review allegations of mismanagement by ONA contracts for political, improper or wasteful activities. Grassley later sought information about ONA contracting processes following a DoD IG audit of the program, which found ONA could not provide sufficient documentation that Halper conducted all of his work in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Pentagon issued a corrective action plan for ONA in August.
On January 23, 2020, Grassley sought an inspector general investigation into the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martin's C-130J aircraft after whistleblower reports alleged a lack of oversight by the DoD has resulted in significant health and safety concerns. On October 8, 2020, Grassley sought additional information from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martin's C-130J after learning of discrepancies in the initial investigation.
Derecho Recovery:
From year to year, natural disasters take place across the country. In August, many Iowans experienced a historic derecho. Immediately after the storm hit, Grassley visited Cedar Rapids to survey damage, meet with residents affected by the storm and visit a local nonprofit assisting in relief efforts. Grassley and Ernst also participated in a roundtable discussion with 20 nonprofit leaders and the Cedar Rapids Community Foundation. The local nonprofits assisted with housing, case management, mental health, volunteer coordination, food access and legal assistance.
Iowa's agricultural community faced significant damage and new challenges resulting from the storm. Grassley led the Iowa congressional delegation in sending a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue urging a prompt approval of Gov. Reynolds Secretarial Disaster Designation request for 57 Iowa counties that suffered losses as a result of the derecho. Following this request, Grassley and Ernst sent an additional letter to USDA requesting it provide additional support for Iowa farmers impacted by the derecho and severe drought. They also sent a letter requesting additional funding for Iowa agricultural cooperatives.
In addition to tens of millions of acres of damaged crops, grain bins across the state were destroyed. Grassley and Ernst requested the U.S. Department of Commerce lift Section 232 tariffs on steel that will be used in Iowa's derecho recovery, especially on steel used for rebuilding grain bins and machine sheds.
Grassley worked with Ernst to file legislation to provide tax relief to Iowans affected by the derecho. The legislation would provide certain employers a tax credit for retaining employees, enhance the tax deduction for disaster-related personal casualty losses, and facilitate enhanced access to tax-exempt retirement plans, among other benefits.
Additionally, Grassley and Ernst worked to ensure Iowans affected by the derecho weren't victims of fraud. They sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate price-gouging scams.
Grassley and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) continued their investigation into the fatal shooting of Bijan Ghaisar by U.S. Park Police in 2017. Grassley first contacted the FBI in December 2018 about its investigation into the shooting, and the FBI responded in March with little information, prompting a follow-up letter from Grassley. Since then the senators also have pressed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide details on specific reforms being implemented to avoid a repeat of its drawn-out and opaque investigation of U.S. Park Police's fatal shooting of Bijan Ghaisar.
This legislative session, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, persistently contacted U.S. Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray to investigate the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane, to bring transparency to FBI mismanagement. Grassley has long been skeptical of the FBI's justification to spy on Carter Page, including its reliance on the debunked anti-Trump dossier, which was compiled by a former British spy, sub-sourced to Russian officials and paid for by then-candidate Trump's Democrat political opponents. The DOJ inspector general determined the dossier to be central and essential to the FBI's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application. The inspector general also determined the FBI's applications included at least 17 errors and omissions and over 50 errors and omissions in the Woods File. After further reviewing the DOJ OIG report on Crossfire Hurricane, Grassley and Johnson sent Barr a follow up letter requesting the declassification of four footnotes in the report on FISA abuses in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Those footnotes were later declassified and showed how Russian disinformation infected the Steele Dossier.
On April 25, 2019, Grassley and Johnson wrote to the DOJ regarding the FBI and how it may have used a counterintelligence briefing to conduct surveillance on the Trump transition team during Crossfire Hurricane.
In April, Grassley and Johnson requested additional Crossfire Hurricane records after the declassified footnotes revealed the Steele Dossier contained reported Russian disinformation.
On May 12, 2020, Grassley and Johnson requested a list of Obama-era officials that unmasked Lt. Gen. Flynn. In response, the Intelligence Community provided a list that included then-Vice President Biden as one of the Obama-era officials that requested to unmask Flynn.
In November, Grassley and Johnson also sent a letter to Barr requesting the full declassification of briefing notes for then-Director James Comey summarizing the FBI's investigative efforts regarding Crossfire Hurricane.
On October 13, 2020, Grassley and Johnson also sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray warning the bureau's recent production of limited text messages from former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was unacceptable and the FBI must produce all records in compliance with previous requests.
On October 15, 2020, Grassley and Johnson sent another letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe seeking an unredacted version of a spreadsheet created to attempt to corroborate allegations made in the discredited Steele Dossier.
Grassley and Johnson also released a majority staff report detailing how the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Office secretly sought and received access to the private records of Donald J. Trump's presidential transition team, Trump for America, Inc., despite an agreement between the Trump transition team and the General Services Administration that those records were the transition team's private property that would not be retained at the conclusion of the transition. Grassley also pressed DOJ for details on steps taken to recover material deleted from mobile devices assigned to Mueller's team, and investigate potential violations of federal record keeping laws. Many of those deletions occurred after the agency watchdog discovered anti-Trump texts on then-FBI agent Peter Strzok's government-issued phone, and after the DOJ IG began reviewing the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.
On December 1, 2020, news broke that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to be special counsel in his ongoing review of the origins of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Grassley praised this decision.
On December 3, 2020, Grassley and Johnson released over 400 pages of records acquired from the DOJ, FBI and State Department during their investigation into the FBI's mishandling of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The production includes recently declassified material that illustrate the flawed decision-making process by federal officials during Crossfire Hurricane.
As part of Grassley's ongoing FARA oversight, he called on the Justice Department to evaluate whether Hunter and James Biden should have registered as foreign agents for their business arrangements with the Chinese government-back energy company CEFC, in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The company was actively seeking to build influence in the United States when it partnered with the Bidens.
Drug Prices:
Grassley has long raised concerns about lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry and the prescription drug supply chain. This year, he also highlighted high prescription drug prices and the concerning trend that the price of many medications are increasing faster than inflation.
As researchers around the world are racing to find a vaccine to combat COVID-19, Grassley welcomed news from Pfizer and Operation Warp Speed accelerating the response to end the pandemic.
As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley and Wyden also partnered on a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices. They sent letters to leading insulin manufacturers, seeking information regarding recent price increases of up to 500% or more for insulin, a treatment available for diabetes for nearly 100 years. This year, they expanded that investigation and warned those companies that were not cooperating.
Grassley also joined several of his colleagues in introducing the PRICE Transparency Act. This legislation would codify the two health care price transparency rules that came out of President Trump's Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare Executive Order which requires hospitals and insurers to reveal their low, discounted cash prices and negotiated rates to consumers before they receive medical care.
On June 2, 2020, Grassley chaired a hearing titled, ""COVID-19 and Beyond: Oversight of the FDA's Foreign Drug Manufacturing Inspection Process."" The hearing was based on Grassley's oversight work on the FDA's foreign drug manufacturing facility inspection process and highlighted the risks associated with drugs manufactured in foreign countries, especially China, and imported to the United States. At the hearing, Grassley introduced into the Committee record thousands of pages of records that he acquired during his FDA investigation relating to China- and India-based drug manufacturing facilities.
Over the years, Grassley has called on pharmaceutical companies to list prices of their prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertisements. In 2019, HHS made good on the promise and finalized a rule requiring price disclosure on TV ads for prescription drugs. However, that rule was challenged by pharmaceutical companies in court and recently overturned. Grassley will continue working to increase transparency from pharmaceutical companies.
Education:
Grassley continued to confront the issue of academic freedom this year. In 2019, he sent letters to the presidents of Duke University, Harvard University, Sarah Lawrence College and Villanova University, seeking information on the current culture of academic freedom on campus. This fall, Grassley followed up on that issue by sending a letter to his colleagues discussing the responses of those colleges and universities. In that letter, he stated the mission of colleges and universities should be to develop the character of young adults by challenging them with new ideas rather than making them feel ""safe."" Grassley concluded his letter by stating, ""[O]ur colleges and universities must ensure that their professors can freely teach their students and that students are free to learn, without retribution.""
While working in Washington, Grassley highlighted Iowa's academic excellence for his colleagues. He praised the state's highest four-year graduation rate in Iowa's history, at 91.6 percent. He also applauded the University of Iowa's independent newspaper, The Daily Iowan, which was named the Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.
Election Integrity:
With another presidential election in 2020, the spotlight was once again on Iowa and the first in the nation caucuses. The Iowa caucuses are an example of grassroots democracy. While not every part of the caucus went according to plan this year, Grassley joined Ernst and Gov. Reynolds in supporting the integrity of the process and demonstrated the seriousness Iowans take in their civic duty.
The COVID-19 pandemic presented many unique challenges in 2020. However, election officials around the country worked diligently to ensure a safe and secure election this November. In Iowa, Secretary of State Paul Pate mailed an absentee ballot request form to every registered Iowa voter for the November election and the state saw a record turnout.
Grassley urged his colleagues not to play political games with election security. He also commended the Treasury Department's announced sanctions on Russian-aligned actors seeking to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Congress in March unanimously approved a $10 billion loan for the U.S. Postal Service to respond to pandemic-related uncertainties. However, the USPS assured lawmakers that it had enough cash on hand to maintain operations through next year even without that loan. In fact, the USPS reported a record amount of cash on hand due to the increase in package deliveries during the pandemic. Even with this additional bipartisan funding, many Democrats continued to undermine faith in the electoral process. Grassley strongly condemned such statements on the Senate floor.
As a champion of renewable fuels and an all-of-the-above American energy policy, Grassley continued his extensive work to enact responsible energy policies throughout 2020. Grassley was a leader in the effort to allow the sale of year-round E15.
Grassley has continued to lead the fight to maintain a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). He led efforts to pressure the EPA to stop issuing ""hardship waivers"" to obligated refiners as well as make the waiver process more transparent and highlighted the importance of the RFS to President Trump. Grassley joined Ernst in voting against Mark Menezes, nominated to be Deputy Secretary of Energy due to lack of transparency among the agencies.
Much of Grassley's energy agenda focused on the RFS. Grassley worked extensively with Senate colleagues, President Trump and the EPA to expand renewable energy and fulfill congressional intent on the RFS. This year, Grassley slammed the proposed Zero-Emission Vehicles Act which would require 50 percent of sales for new passenger vehicles to be all electric by 2025 and mandate 100 percent of new sales for the U.S. passenger transportation fleet by 2035.
Grassley joined his partner in the Senate, Ernst, in sending a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting clarification on its temporary policy for the manufacture of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than wait for the economy to rebound, biofuel producers across Iowa shifted production to manufacture hand sanitizer to help meet the needs of their communities across the state.
Last year, Grassley and Ernst fought hard to include the biodiesel tax credit in the year-end funding package. In February, the two Iowa senators called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to promptly process 2018-2019 biodiesel tax credit claims.
In addition to ethanol and biodiesel, Grassley highlighted the importance of wind energy in Iowa and around the country.
Federal Judiciary:
As a former chairman and senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley rigorously vetted and reviewed judicial nominations to ensure our federal judges will interpret and apply the law as written, not legislate from the bench based on policy preferences.
President Trump has made an effort to nominate constitutionalist and textualist judges who understand the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system. Under Grassley's leadership, the Judiciary Committee oversaw the confirmation of a record 30 circuit court judges, which is the most circuit court confirmations in the first two years of any presidency in history, and in 2020, the Senate has confirmed a record number of circuit court nominees. These confirmations will have an important impact on our country for decades to come.
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away in September, leaving behind a historic legacy that will live on for generations. With an opening on the highest court in the land, Grassley supported Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in moving forward to fill the vacancy. In 2016, citing a divided government, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and his committee colleagues exercised their constitutional authority to withhold consent on any nominee prior to the completion of the election. The circumstances were different in 2020, where the American people elected a Republican President and Senate in 2016 and expanded the Republican Senate majority in 2018.
Later that month, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Grassley met with Judge Barrett and vetted her credentials. Grassley strongly supported Judge Barrett in the hearings and urged his colleagues to support her in the final vote before the full senate. In late October, the Senate approved Judge Barrett's nomination by a vote of 52-48. As Senate President pro tempore, Grassley presided over the vote.
Throughout Justice Barrett's confirmation process, he admonished Democrats who were threatening to pack the courts with partisan judges.
Throughout the pandemic, the Supreme Court allowed live audio streams of oral arguments conducted via teleconference following pandemic-induced lockdowns. The unprecedented live audio feed broadened access to real-time proceedings far beyond the Court's limited seating capacity even in normal times. The move sparked widespread praise from transparency advocates and the general public. Grassley and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) renewed their push to allow live video coverage of court proceedings even after the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
Foster youth, adoption, families and elder care:
Throughout his congressional career, Grassley has advocated for children and families. He continued his work on these issues in 2020 by developing policies aimed at protecting special needs children, preventing elder abuse, encouraging elder independence and promoting funding for programs to improve family health.
Grassley has long been a leader in the effort to protect older Americans, especially those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Grassley has helped lead congressional oversight of nursing homes and their response to the deadly pandemic.
In April, Grassley wrote to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma regarding several issues related to the outbreak of COVID-19 at long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the country. Grassley expressed concerns about testing capacity, inconsistencies in data tracking, a lack of PPE and transparency in federal spending. Following Grassley's call on CMS to require nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to report all cases of COVID-19 to the federal government, the agency took such steps to ensure transparency and usable data.
In July, Grassley and Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) introduced the Emergency Support for Nursing Homes and Elder Justice Reform Act of 2020, which would improve existing programs to protect older Americans and provide help to nursing homes and their staff providing care for vulnerable residents. The legislation includes several provisions to help nursing homes manage COVID-19 outbreaks, including the establishment of specialty regional ""strike teams"" and extends COVID-19 related reporting requirements through the end of 2020. The bill calls on states receiving federal relief assistance to devote some funding to tele-visitation programs so nursing home residents aren't isolated from family throughout the pandemic. It also renews and reauthorizes funding for several programs enacted in the Elder Justice Act of 2009 and boosts transparency and accountability measures for underperforming nursing homes.
Following the Trump administration's announcement that it would require weekly testing of nursing home staffers and the disbursement of an additional $5 billion in funding to these facilities, Grassley praised the action as a big step in the right direction, which will help further protect the lives and health of both the residents of nursing facilities and the dedicated staff who care for them.
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley continued his oversight work and released a comprehensive report on care in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in the United States during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The report, titled ""COVID-19 and Nursing Homes: What Went Wrong and Next Steps,"" reviews U.S. nursing home performance during the first eight months of the pandemic.
He also sent a letter to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at HHS requesting the OIG initiate an investigation into whether or not five states California, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania violated federal guidance in pressuring nursing home facilities to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19.
Grassley partnered with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), to protect seniors with dementia from harm and exploitation. The Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act successfully passed out of the Senate and would ensure the Department of Justice's elder abuse training materials take into account individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
Grassley has spent decades advocating on behalf of older Americans and families of children with special needs and complex medical conditions and authored key provisions in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that was enacted 30 years ago.
Grassley, in his capacity as Senate Finance Committee Chairman, convened a bipartisan working group to address federal paid family leave policies. The working group considered ideas and principles relating to the issue of paid family leave and reviewed existing legislation introduced by several senators on and off the committee and from both parties.
In the year-end COVID-19 economic relief and funding legislative package, Grassley advocated for additional support for the elder community. This legislation included $100 million to support elder justice initiatives, including 50 million for state adult protective service agencies as they cope with unique challenges of serving vulnerable populations during the pandemic.
Good Government and Transparency:
Grassley has been a longtime advocate for inspectors general and government oversight regardless of political party and administration. On April 8, 2020, Grassley led a bipartisan group of lawmakers in calling on President Trump to provide a detailed written explanation for his decision to remove an inspector general. In the letter, the lawmakers underscore the important role inspectors general play in holding agencies accountable and outline the removal procedures, which are designed to prevent political interference. This comes after two inspectors generals were terminated this spring.
On April 14, 2020, Grassley and Wyden wrote to Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, in his role as chair of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), regarding CIGIE's role in the inspector general nominating process. They inquired about the CIGIE recommendation process, the consistency of its advice to the White House, the rate at which its advice is taken by the White House and how often CIGIE has expressed concerns about IG vacancies.
Following complaints from dozens of whistleblowers, Grassley and his colleagues also continued their investigation into whistleblower allegations of low morale and low productivity at the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General.
On October 6, 2020, Grassley led a bipartisan letter to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Conference urging the protection of the work of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). The Senate-passed version of the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included language that would have limited SIGAR's jurisdiction to just six reconstruction funds and severely restricted SIGAR's oversight of reconstruction spending, to exclude oversight authority over internationally monitored trust funds like the World-Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, military construction, human rights and anti-corruption assistance, and certain counternarcotics programs. This section was removed from the House and Senate Conference NDAA, preserving SIGAR's oversight authority over crucial overseas funds.
Grassley joined his colleagues, Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to change the authority of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to conduct a thorough and rigorous review of independent agencies' regulations. Currently, independent agencies are not required to undergo a review by OIRA. They wrote, in part, ""Although these agencies have been created with certain protections designed to insulate them from the political process, they are not a fourth branch of government that is exempt from Congressional and Executive oversight.""
On February 5, 2020 Grassley and Johnson sought records of Hunter Biden's travel while he was under U.S. Secret Service protection as part of their investigation into potential conflicts of interest among the Biden family when Joe Biden was Vice President.
Grassley and Johnson faced unhelpful challenges from their Democratic colleagues regarding their oversight work. In February they rebuked their colleagues who attempted to undermine legitimate oversight by selectively leaking information from their Biden investigation. In August, they urged their colleagues to stop falsely claiming the Ukraine/Biden investigation was subject to Russian disinformation.
On September 23, 2020, Grassley and Johnson released a report that revealed millions of dollars in questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals, including individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. They later released a supplemental report with new information which confirmed connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese government, as well as the links between Hunter Biden's business associates and the Russian government.
In October, news broke referencing an alleged Hunter Biden laptop with additional pertinent information relating to Grassley and Johnson's investigation. They immediately sent a letter to United States Secret Service Director James Murray highlighting references to Hunter Biden's travel from recently published emails that appear to align with Secret Service records previously produced to the committees. The chairmen also requested records to verify whether the Secret Service traveled with Hunter Biden after he apparently discontinued his protective detail.
Grassley joined Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) in introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal financial management by updating the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. The CFO Act created a new foundation for federal financial management and established a fiscal management reporting and leadership structure.
Additionally, Grassley partnered with Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) to introduce bipartisan legislation to increase transparency and accountability within the federal government. The Oversight.gov Authorization Act would formally authorize the establishment and maintenance of a website to help the public more easily access reports that have been generated by the independent work of Inspectors General.
Grassley, and Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) requested information about the federal government's ability to timely respond to public records requests in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Justice Department's Office of Information Policy (OIP), the senators, all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted reports of decreased capability to process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and other concerning developments, including the FBI's decision to stop accepting electronic requests altogether. The senators also released the findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report titled ""Freedom of Information Act: Federal Agencies' Recent Implementation Efforts.""
Grassley continued his work to ensure Social Security remains strong for generations to come. Along with House Ways and Means Ranking Member Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Grassley wrote to the Chief Actuary of Social Security regarding the use of his office for political purposes and pushed for public clarifications to recently published analysis that has allowed for partisan misinformation to be spread by Democrats. As the leading Republican tax writers, Grassley and Brady argued that Social Security's actuaries should not be used for political purposes. The Chief Actuary of Social Security promptly responded with a letter and affirmed that he was ""not aware that anyone has proposed"" legislation like Senate Democrats outlined in a recent request, which they subsequently used to spread false and misleading partisan messaging. Grassley took to the Senate floor to set the record straight and urged his Democratic colleagues to stop spreading misinformation to scare Social Security beneficiaries.
In October, Grassley and Brady again reached out to request more information on how the Office of the Chief Actuary functions, particularly in responding to requests from outside groups, using taxpayer dollars. ""Given the finite resources available and the important services the SSA provides to Americans, it is essential that the agency's budget is used wisely. For that reason, we are seeking additional information regarding practices of the Office of the Chief Actuary for information, analysis, and/or technical assistance requested by non-government individuals and organizations,"" the members wrote.
In December, Grassley and Brady requested that the Chief Actuary of Social Security explain misleading testimony that the actuary presented before a congressional committee in July. In that testimony, the Chief Actuary appeared to have been attempting to provide justification for lack of prior action on an important issue in Social Security by Congress. As the letter from Grassley and Brady to the Chief Actuary identified: ""It is not the job of anyone at the Social Security Administration to justify decisions made by Congress and we are concerned by your recent attempt to do so.
Health Care:
With the COVID-19 pandemic, families faced unique challenges accessing health care services. Recognizing this, Grassley introduced the bipartisan Accelerating Kids' Access to Care Act to help families access life-saving care for children with complex medical conditions. The legislation aims to facilitate access to care while retaining program safeguards and reducing regulatory burdens on providers. This legislation builds off the Grassley-sponsored Advancing Care for Exceptional (ACE) Kids Act, which was signed into law in 2019, which makes it easier for the many providers who treat children with complex conditions to coordinate care and improve outcomes.
In September, Grassley fought to include the Medicare Part B Premium Adjustment provision in the Senate appropriations bill. This will protect Medicare beneficiaries from an expected spike in the Part B premium for 2021 caused by economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grassley also authored a provision to address concerns with the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. This provision delays the date on which hospitals and other providers must start to repay Medicare Accelerated and Advance payment loans and makes other changes to relax repayment terms, while protecting the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund.
Throughout the pandemic, Grassley worked with the Trump administration on a variety of health care policies. He praised the Administration's reforms to the Medicaid program which will allow more flexibility for states while they continue to care for and protect individual Americans and communities at most risk.
Grassley also followed up with the FDA this year to ensure Americans can access over-the-counter hearing aids without delay. Grassley's Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, which was signed into law in 2017 to remove outdated regulations blocking consumer access to affordable hearing aids, required the FDA to issue these proposed regulations no later than August 18, 2020, but the FDA has yet to do so.
Grassley partnered with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to introduce a bipartisan resolution designating the week of October 5 through October 9 2020, as ""Malnutrition Awareness Week."" The resolution recognizes the impact the pandemic has had on vulnerable populations and supports emergency funding for federal nutrition programs to combat malnutrition. Grassley also highlighted mental health awareness month and the services available to Iowans during this difficult time.
Over the years, Congress has considered a number of initiatives aimed at addressing maternal health. Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden asked stakeholders to submit data and findings on factors contributing to poor maternal health outcomes in the United States. The Senate Finance Committee leaders also requested specific, evidence-based solutions to address those factors and improve maternal health. In addition, in June 2020, Grassley wrote a letter to every member of the Senate Finance Committee soliciting ideas for how to address racial and ethnic health disparities.
Grassley also continued his oversight work into the nation's organ donation and procurement system. In October, he sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This probe comes after numerous inspector general audits and news reports raised questions about the adequacy of patient safety standards, suggested thousands of available organs are not being used and highlighted questionable financial practices of some organ procurement organizations (OPOs). This letter is part of the ongoing investigation into the conduct of the nation's organ procurement organizations, and the oversight gaps present in the U.S. organ donation and procurement system. In February, Grassley and Wyden jointly initiated this bipartisan investigation with Senators Young and Cardin when they sent an expansive request for information and data to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which was contracted by Congress nearly four decades ago to oversee the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). This investigation is ongoing.
In April 2019, Grassley and Wyden jointly began investigations of organizations in their home states that provide services to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). This December, they released two investigative reports regarding the performance and efficacy of providers REM Iowa and MENTOR Oregon, which receive significant federal funding through Medicaid to provide care for individuals with I/DD. Grassley's review of REM Iowa found that the company has had and continues to face problems, including failures to report abuse or neglect, failures to follow an individual's particular care plan and failures to adhere to clients' medication schedules. Grassley's report makes three specific recommendations to REM Iowa: improve training practices for employees, improve access to data and establish a process to track and monitor critical incidents using electronic databases. Grassley's report also recommends that the federal and state governments improve oversight, outreach and support for facilities facing systemic issues.
On December 2, 2020, Grassley wrote a letter to every member of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees about the need for new attention to the tax laws governing non-profit hospitals. In late 2019, Grassley announced he was renewing his probe of non-profit, tax-exempt hospitals. ""It's time for Americans to have more financial information available to them when going to the hospital and working with their insurance companies. It's time for Congress to empower Americans to shop for healthcare in a competitive, functional market so as to reduce the costs of care and coverage, and save individuals and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars,"" Grassley wrote.
Grassley joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce legislation to protect property owners whose assets are seized by the federal government. An earlier version of the bill was introduced in 2016, following a Judiciary Committee hearing that examined several concerns associated with law enforcement asset seizure policies and practices. The hearing identified gaps in procedural protections for property owners whose assets were seized despite the absence of criminal charges or convictions. Additionally, many individuals whose assets are seized don't know their rights and don't know how to proceed to challenge the seizure.
Illegal, illicit drugs, and opioids:
In 2020, Grassley continued his longtime work addressing illegal and illicit drug manufacturing and addiction in the U.S. He joined Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in introducing the Methamphetamine Response Act, a bill declaring methamphetamine an emerging drug threat which would require the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to develop, implement and make public a national plan to prevent methamphetamine addiction and overdoses from becoming a crisis. This bill passed the Senate on November 16, 2020 but wasn't considered for final passage in the House of Representatives.
Grassley also cosponsored the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. President Trump signed this bill into law in February, which extends a Drug Enforcement Administration temporary scheduling order to proactively control deadly fentanyl analogues. Fentanyl-related overdose deaths continue to rise and sophisticated drug trafficking organizations manipulate dangerous substances to skirt the law, so this critical law placed fentanyl substances in Schedule I so that they can be better detected and criminals can be held accountable for their actions. This Grassley supported law sunsets in May of 2021.
Grassley and Ernst once again urged Iowans to participate in National Drug Take-Back Day. Unused, unneeded and expired prescription medicines present risk for misuse and theft. Responsible disposal can help prevent accidental poisoning, addiction and overdose deaths.
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Finance Committee, Grassley initiated a bipartisan investigation with Ranking Member Ron Wyden, and sent letters to 10 tax-exempt organizations requesting information about their financial relationship with opioid manufacturers. This is a continuation of the investigation Grassley started in 2012, when he was Ranking Member of Judiciary. This investigation requested payment data, IRS Form 990s, and copies of comments and written materials that the tax-exempt organization sent to Federal task forces, committees, and other advisory groups from 2012 to the present. The purpose of this request was to discover whether these tax-exempt advocacy groups echoed or amplified the messages of pharmaceutical donors to sway public and Federal opinion about opioid prescribing practices. Grassley and Wyden expect to release the findings of their investigation before the end of the year.
Immigration and Visas:
Grassley has been a longtime supporter of the E-verify program and reintroduced the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act this Congress, which would permanently authorize and require employers to use the E-Verify program. E-Verify is an internet-based system that assists employers in determining the eligibility of employees to work in the United States.
Grassley and a bipartisan group of Senators renewed calls for significant regulatory or legislative reforms to the H-2B visa program before increasing the annual visa cap. They raised concerns that the flawed non-agriculture guest worker visa program displaces American workers and can incentivize the exploitation of both foreign and American workers.
Additionally, Grassley sent a letter to Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner Andrew Saul and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Chad Wolf seeking information on why SSA was not providing the statutorily required information to DHS regarding noncitizens working on and reporting wage earnings to non-work Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Grassley's letter follows a concerning SSA Inspector General report that discussed the issue last year. The use of non-work SSNs to obtain employment and work illegally is not an insignificant problem. The OIG report stated that approximately 364,000 people with non-work SSNs reported billions of dollars in wages over a 3-year tax period from 2014-2016.
Grassley joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to introduce legislation to reform and close loopholes in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act would prioritize American workers and restore fairness in visa programs for skilled foreign workers. The legislation reinstates Congress' original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders. Grassley also praised the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security this year as they worked to address abuses in the high-skilled guest worker program that has been used to displace American workers with low-paid foreign labor.
Grassley sought information on a number of cases in which a crime was carried out by someone who was in the United States illegally. Grassley and Ernst requested answers regarding a suspected al Qaeda leader wanted for murdering two Iraqi police officers who was able to receive refugee status in the United States and later become a U.S. citizen. He also joined a group of Republican senators to investigate how a Mexican national illegally in the country was never removed despite having a history of violent and illegal behavior that culminated in the deaths of four law enforcement motorcycle club members. Ivan Robles Navejas is charged with causing a head-on collision with members of the Thin Blue Line Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club in July, killing four riders and injuring several others. He was allegedly intoxicated at the time of the collision, and had previously faced assault, drunk driving and resisting arrest charges dating back to 2013.
In the past, Grassley has raised concerns about visa mills that masquerade as educational institutions but actually function as de facto employment agencies that help aliens fraudulently enter the United States under F-1 student visas. Grassley continued his oversight of F-1 visa fraud in 2020 by pressing DHS about the steps it is taking to crack down on fraudulent companies providing fake employment offers to foreign students seeking to extend their F-1 visas and remain in the U.S. after graduation.
Impeachment:
At the beginning of the year, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced she would transmit articles of impeachment to the United States Senate. As president pro tempore of the Senate, Grassley presided over the opening of the impeachment trial of President Trump. Throughout the trial, Grassley fulfilled his duty to thoughtfully consider all the facts.
Following the proceedings, he criticized the House's flawed process and evolving arguments, and expressed the importance of respecting precedent. Removing a president for legal actions based on a flawed and partisan process, especially in the midst of an election year, would set a dangerous standard for future impeachments. He ultimately rejected the articles of impeachment on constitutional, legal and prudential grounds.
Infrastructure:
Grassley continued to address the increased need for rural broadband in 2020. Grassley has a long history of working to close the digital divide in Iowa. He is a strong advocate for rural broadband deployment and providing the tools necessary to make sure rural America is not left behind. Grassley supported the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act that requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue new rules to require the collection and dissemination of granular broadband availability data and to establish a process to verify the accuracy of such data. President Trump signed this bill into law in March. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 fully funds the Broadband DATA Act.
He also highlighted the Federal Highway Administration's proposed new rule to advance broadband technology in rural America. The proposed rule would help improve coordination and utilize construction projects for installation of broadband infrastructure.
In 2019, Iowa faced devastating and historic flooding across the state. Grassley and Ernst held a hearing in Southwest Iowa that focused on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) management of the Missouri River. They closely monitored the situation along the western border and sent a letter urging the USACE to provide additional funding for projects to improve safety and navigation on the lower Missouri River. Grassley praised the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) for helping fund critical projects to help with flood recovery, including the announcement awarding a $7.9 million grant to the city of Hamburg, Iowa, to make critical infrastructure improvements needed to protect businesses along the Missouri River from flooding. This EDA grant, to be matched with $1.9 million in local investment, is expected to create or retain 349 jobs.
Grassley also joined Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to introduce new legislation to overhaul the USACE process for managing water resource projects along the lower Missouri River system. The Lower Missouri River Flood Prevention Program Act would require the USACE to implement a new system-wide approach to water development projects to reduce flood risk and improve flood protection along the lower Missouri River.
On the other side of the state, Grassley praised the Corps' decision to approve three Port Statistical Areas (PSAs) on the Mississippi River. This federal recognition as a multi-modal port region will be leveraged by local governments and businesses for marketing and economic development that will improve regional, national and global competitiveness.
Grassley praised the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (WRDA) which was included in the year-end funding bill. WRDA addresses the civil works program of the Army Corps of Engineers. Grassley advocated for a number of provisions that were incorporated in the final bill including the Inland Waterway Trust Fund Cost Share Program. This provision modifies the cost share for construction or major rehabilitation of a project on the inland waterways to 65 percent from the general fund of the Treasury and 35 percent from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund.
Grassley also worked to include a provision that would make temporary flood control structures permanent. This provision creates a new authority for the Corps to review whether temporary flood control structures it has constructed should be made permanent, and allows the local cost-share for making them permanent to be waived for communities that are small, financially disadvantaged or at risk of recurring flooding.
Additionally, Grassley was vocal to include a provision to update the Des Moines Birdland Levee. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorized the Des Moines and Raccoon River project which was completed in 2012. However, due to design deficiencies by the Corps, approximately 1.7 miles of this levee does not meet the Corps' design criteria for under-seepage. This additional authorized funding will bring the deficient portion of the levee up to Corps standards.
The final bill also contains important provisions for Iowans including expanding work on a Lower Missouri River Basin Flood Risk Resiliency Plan, expedited completion of maintenance and repair activities for federally operated and maintained levees systems in the Lower Missouri River basin, expedited processing of permits and approvals of repairs of flood control infrastructure caused by flood in 2019, changes to the PL 84-99 non-federal levee program to enhance flood protections, further prohibitions of Interception-Rearing Complex's (IRc's), continuation of work on the Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan along with several other provisions critical to flood control and navigation.
Grassley partnered with Ernst and went to bat for Iowa Minor League Baseball this year. They joined a bipartisan resolution and urged support for preserving Minor League Baseball clubs across the country, including those in Davenport, Burlington and Clinton, in response to Major League Baseball's (MLB) proposal to eliminate 42 teams nationwide. The Des Moines Iowa Cubs, Cedar Rapids Kernels, and the Quad Cities River Bandits are all retaining affiliation with MLB teams in the region. The Clinton LumberKings and Burlington Bees will have opportunities to join other leagues.
Law Enforcement:
To honor the service and sacrifice made by the men and women in law enforcement, Grassley supported a resolution designating the week of May 11 through May 17, 2020, as ""National Police Week.""
During Police Week, a bipartisan package of law enforcement bills championed by Grassley sailed through the Senate, including the Confidentiality Opportunities for Peer Support (COPS) Counseling Act. Senator Grassley is the lead Republican on this bill, which provides mental health support to law enforcement by encouraging the adoption of peer counselling programs, while protecting the privacy of federal officers who participate.
The Judiciary Committee also advanced the Grassley supported Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act, which requires the FBI to collect voluntarily submitted, anonymous data on police suicides and attempted suicides from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Collecting this data will help inform policy solutions to promote prevention of law enforcement suicides.
Grassley also supported legislation to help the nation's first responders. Without skipping a beat, first responders adapted to the ever-changing demands of the pandemic. Grassley and a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation to ensure families of public safety officers lost to COVID-19 can quickly access survivor benefits. The Safeguarding America's First Responders Act (SAFR) clarifies the certification requirements for survivor benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program to account for the unique challenges presented by the pandemic. In August, President Trump signed this bill into law.
These three bills - along with the resolution commemorating National Police Week - won unanimous approval in the Senate.
This year, many Americans called for Congress to enact police reforms. Grassley supported Sen. Tim Scott's (R-S.C.) proposal. The JUSTICE Act included bipartisan provisions to improve accountability and transparency in policing. It also designated lynching as a federal hate crime and penalized states for allowing police to use chokeholds. However, this legislation did not move forward on the Senate floor because Senate Democrats refused to even debate the legislation or work with Scott or other senators on police reform legislation.
National Security:
This year, President Trump made a historic breakthrough for peace in the Middle East with the signing of the Abraham Accords. This is the first tangible progress in a quarter century. Grassley met Anwar Sadat at the time of the Camp David Accords in 1978 and witnessed the handshake between Rabin and Arafat in 1993.
An Iowan, Mr. Christopher Miller, was nominated to be Director of the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Grassley had the honor to introduce him at his confirmation hearing. Christopher Miller is currently serving as the Acting Secretary of Defense.
Grassley joined 42 Senate colleagues in supporting a resolution honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who carried out the successful mission that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and a designated terrorist.
Grassley also joined his Senate colleagues in commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998. The senators called on the Trump administration and Congress ""to deliver justice to the victims and their families and appropriately and equitably address terrorism-related claims against Sudan.""
On June 5, 2020, Grassley chaired a hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research titled, ""Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-Funded Research: Oversight Opportunities and Policy Solutions."" That same day, Grassley held a classified member-level briefing on the same subject. Grassley is a leading voice in the effort to protect the integrity of taxpayer-funded research. In addition to his inquiries to DoD, Grassley also pressed the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Health and Human Services Inspector General, Justice Department, and Government Accountability Office on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research.
Presidential Nominations:
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley carried out the Senate's constitutionally mandated ""advice and consent"" responsibilities respecting presidential nominations to many key departments and agencies. During the 116th Congress, the Finance Committee reported 21 individual nominations to the full Senate and 19 of those have been confirmed, including: Andrew M. Saul to be Commissioner of Social Security, Brent James McIntosh to be an Under Secretary of the Treasury, and Michael J. Desmond to be Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service.
Reform to Victims' Rights Laws:
In 2020, Grassley continued his work to prevent abuse of young athletes. He introduced legislation, the Stopping Abuse From Entering Sports, Promoting Oversight, Responsibility And Transparency (SAFESPORT) Act. It builds on an earlier measure Grassley cosponsored and shepherded through the Judiciary Committee in 2018, during his tenure as that committee's chairman. His latest proposal includes funding accountability measures, anti-retaliation protections, child abuse reporting requirements, and other reforms. The Senate passed this landmark legislation in August.
Grassley also joined his colleagues in introducing several bipartisan Senate resolutions to support victims of sexual and domestic violence. One expresses support for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month and another honors those who have worked to help crime victims during the pandemic. These measures passed the Senate by unanimous consent.
Religious Freedoms:
The Declaration of Independence recognizes each individual is endowed with unalienable rights. However, countries around the world still have blasphemy laws with religious persecution still taking place. In October 2018, Grassley sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing concerns about the ongoing religious persecution of religious minorities by the communist regime in China. The State Department placed visa restrictions last fall on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention or abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs or other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China. Grassley has continued to monitor this situation and hold world organizations accountable for their complicit support of China.
Second Amendment:
Grassley and his colleagues encouraged the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to continue protecting public safety while respecting the Second Amendment and federal law during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
They wrote, ""As our country continues to respond to the pandemic, we are seeking additional information on the impact the coronavirus has had on your agencies and the firearm transfer process so that we have a clearer picture on where things stand and how we can better assist through the legislative and appropriations process.""
Grassley also joined a letter with Senator Braun and other colleagues to Attorney General Barr and ATF Acting Director Lombardo to share their concern about the ATF practice of relying on non-public standards in its regulation of the importation of pistol stabilizing braces. The letter requests that ATF clearly articulate its position on the regulation of pistol braces, as a ""know it when you see it"" approach to firearms by the ATF can quickly become a slippery slope for all legal American gun owners as well as government firearm regulation enforcement.
After assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee in January, 2019, Grassley worked closely with the Treasury Department as it issued regulations and other guidance related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provided clarity to families, farmers, cooperatives, and businesses small to large on changes to the business tax rules including the 20-percent deduction for pass-through businesses, the opportunity zones initiative, and international tax laws.
Following this work, Grassley raised concerns about Joe Biden's tax proposals. Biden vowed to raise taxes immediately on U.S. businesses, undo the 2017 tax law and impose trillions of dollars in tax hikes on individuals and businesses.
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley convened a hearing on the 2020 tax filing season and the IRS' handling of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Throughout this hearing, Grassley questioned how the IRS was managing its standard responsibilities during the pandemic while also implementing a number of tax measures enacted by Congress to provide relief to individuals and businesses.
Grassley also joined Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) who chairs the Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee, in releasing a comprehensive reform package to address the financial crisis in the multiemployer pension plan system. The Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and Reform Plan would provide targeted financial assistance to a number of large severely underfunded multiemployer plans and reform the overall system to protect workers and retirees from financial hardships resulting from the failure of their multiemployer pension plan. Since the release of the plan, Grassley has pursued bipartisan discussions to develop a consensus agreement to reform the multiemployer system for the long-term.
In August, Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden concluded their investigation into syndicated conservation-easement transactions and released a report on that investigation. The report found those transactions ""to be nothing more than retail tax shelters that let taxpayers buy tax deductions at the end of any given year, ... which thousands of taxpayers used to game the tax code and deprive the federal government of billions of dollars in revenue."" It concluded that ""the IRS has strong reason for taking enforcement action against syndicated conservation-easement transactions as it has to date"" and called on Congress, the IRS, and the Department of the Treasury to take further action to preserve the integrity of the conservation-easement tax deduction.
Grassley also continued to advocate for clean energy tax policies in Congress. In January, he joined his colleagues in sending a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig requesting information to better understand how the IRS enforces the electric vehicle tax credit in light of a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration audit report that detailed what appear to be systemic problems with the tax-credit program. And in February, he called out Senate Democrats' on their misleading and baseless letter regarding energy tax policies that ignore recent and longer-term history on how to successfully enact bipartisan green energy policies.
Grassley worked with Wyden to support the Treasury Department's participation in the multilateral process at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is intended to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. In letters and other communications throughout this legislative session, Grassley and Wyden expressed their strong bipartisan opposition to unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs) that target and discriminate against U.S.-based companies operating around the world. Earlier this year, Grassley and Wyden supported an agreement between the United States and France postponing the imposition of the French digital services tax in favor of reaching a multilateral agreement at the OECD. Grassley and Wyden also opposed a U.K. digital service tax that took effect in July. With additional DSTs being introduced or considered by U.S. trading partners, Grassley and Wyden voiced support for USTR's investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act of foreign DSTs. Grassley and Wyden also supported USTR's decision to impose additional tariffs on French goods after a 180-day deferral period.
The state of trade policy took center stage in 2020. Grassley was a central figure in the debate, advocating vigorously on behalf of Iowa's interests.
In the last three years, Grassley provided extensive support to the President's efforts to renegotiate NAFTA. The updated trade pact reached by the President is called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and provides a host of new benefits for America's farmers, workers, and manufacturers. The nonpartisan International Trade Commission estimates that USMCA will add more than $68 billion to U.S. gross domestic product and generate 176,000 jobs.
As part of ensuring that USMCA was passed, Grassley made clear the Administration's national security steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico would have to be dropped as would those countries' retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. All sides' tariffs came down and Iowa's farmers regained access to two of their most important markets.
As President pro tempore of the Senate, Grassley led an enrollment ceremony to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act. Grassley's signing of the legislation was the final step before it went to the president for his signature to become law. Grassley then attended the USMCA signing ceremony at the White House.
Grassley has long recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) can be a powerful tool to remove foreign trade barriers. However, the WTO needs significant reform particularly in light of its failure to address China's abusive trade practices. Grassley held a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the road ahead for the WTO.
Grassley also supported the President in confronting China on its abusive trade practices. Grassley welcomed the Phase 1 deal the President reached with China. Iowans, especially hog, corn and soybean farmers, will benefit from provisions in the deal that remove trade barriers, and commit China to increasing purchases of agricultural products. Grassley also attended the Phase 1 deal signing ceremony at the White House.
The U.S. continued to expand its market this year with ethanol in Brazil. Grassley praised the new agreement which will allow 198 million gallons of ethanol into the country duty-free with imported gallons beyond that subject to the 20 percent tariff. Brazil was the largest U.S. ethanol export market last year, purchasing 332 million gallons of U.S.-produced ethanol worth $493 million.
To address the disruptions and deficient supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Grassley and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) called for an expedited investigation to identify the products that may be needed to respond to the pandemic. The lawmakers requested the Commission produce a report by April 30 detailing the tariff classifications and applicable rates of duty associated with the products to assist the Committees in their work to combat the coronavirus emergency. Following the initial report, Grassley and his colleagues again wrote to the Commission to conduct a follow-on investigation and prepare a report as there were persistent challenges in meeting supply for these critical products.
Over the summer, Grassley held a series of hearings titled, ""Protecting the Reliability of the U.S. Medical Supply Chain During the COVID-19 Pandemic."" Grassley highlighted the pandemic brings greater urgency to efforts to build resiliencies into our essential supply chains required to avoid shortages and protect American lives.
In 2020, Grassley continued hosting Iowa veterans to participate in the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project. Established by Congress in 2000, the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress collects, preserves and makes accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. To date, more than 1,200 stories from Iowans have been recorded for the project. In November of 2018, Grassley's office interviewed Iowa veterans at the Iowa Gold Star Museum at Camp Dodge in Des Moines to document their service to the nation. In May, he delivered 20 veterans' recorded interviews and documents. In November of 2019, Grassley's office interviewed Iowa veterans at Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown. In December, he delivered 11 veterans' recorded interviews and documents. This year, Grassley's staff interviewed Iowa veterans at the Waverly Area Veterans Post.
The Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act, authored by Sen. Ernst and cosponsored by Sens. Grassley, John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) unanimously passed the Senate in July. This bill requires that every health care provider hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with a revoked license must undergo a third party review of that provider's care. If the review determines that a competent practitioner would have managed the veteran's care differently, the veteran will be notified.
The U.S. Secretary of Interior announced at the Iowa Gold Star Military Museum in Johnston that starting on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2020, all U.S. veterans and Gold Star families will be given free entry into national parks, federal lands and wildlife refuges managed by the U.S. Department of Interior. This new, lifetime benefit provides free admission for millions of veterans and their families. Grassley praised this announcement and honored all the nation's veterans for their dedication and sacrifice.
Additionally, Grassley urged his colleagues to join him in his decades-long effort to establish a memorial on the National Mall to those Black Revolutionary War patriots who fought for the founding of our country.
Whistleblowers:
As a staunch proponent of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government and as a founding member of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, Grassley has long championed the cause of whistleblowers.
In March, Grassley introduced an amendment to the American Energy Innovation Act. This amendment addresses a critical shortcoming with the whistleblower protections currently available to the power sector employees responsible for maintaining and securing our nation's electric grid. It also makes it clear that power sector employees who report threats to our electric grid are protected from retaliation.
Grassley also introduced the CFTC Fund Management Act. This legislation includes important updates to the Commodity Future Trading Commission's highly successful whistleblower program, including an increase to the statutory cap for the fund used to pay whistleblower awards and new audit requirements designed to increase transparency.
The federal government recovered more than $3 billion in taxpayer dollars lost to fraud in 2019, using a law championed by Grassley. Whistleblower claims account for more than two-thirds of those recoveries. Since its enactment in 1986, the False Claims Act is responsible for more than $62 billion in recoveries, with Grassley's whistleblower provision saving taxpayers more than $44.7 billion.
To honor the critical role played by whistleblowers in promoting good governance, Grassley introduced a resolution designating July 30, 2020, as ""National Whistleblower Appreciation Day."" It passed the Senate by unanimous consent.
This year, our country faced down a worldwide pandemic that produced a prolonged economic crisis. Although these are clearly divisive times, Grassley continued his work as one of the most bipartisan legislators in the Senate, working with his colleagues across the aisle to find solutions to the pressing problems we faced in 2020. Grassley looks forward to continuing that work in 2021, when he will once again assume Republican leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee even as he continues his important work on behalf of Iowans on the Finance, Budget, and Agriculture Committees."

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today marked a series of policy and oversight accomplishments of 2020.“While this past year has been challenging for us all, serving the people of Iowa is my first priority and it’s an honor that I take seriously. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and through my extensive oversight efforts, my work focuses on making the government more transparent, efficient and accountable to Iowans and all Americans,” Grassley said.Grassley holds at least one question-and-answer session in each of Iowa’s 99 counties every year to hear concerns and answer questions on any subject from Iowans. In 2020, Grassley completed his annual county meetings for the 40th year in a row. Grassley holds meetings in a variety of settings to ensure that a broad cross-section of Iowans can participate, including businesses, schools, town hall meetings, hospitals and factory floors. While the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some of Grassley’s meetings look a little different this year, the format remained the same: Iowans set the agenda. Grassley moved forward with his meetings in a safe and responsible way while following public health guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the state of Iowa.In addition to his annual meetings, Grassley attended or convened a variety of events and forums, including:
Agriculture Discussion with State and Federal Leaders Veterans History Project Survey of Derecho Damage
In 2020, Grassley continued his annual social media series called #CornWatch and #SoybeanWatch. These give followers an inside look at farming operations and to track the progression of corn and soybean crops grown on the Grassley family farm in New Hartford, Iowa, from planting through harvest.When the Senate is in session, Grassley sets aside at least eight 15-minute meetings every Monday through Thursday to meet with Iowans in Washington, D.C , including advocacy groups, associations, chambers of commerce and local business leaders, students and families. While there were limitations this year due to the pandemic, Grassley was able to meet with Iowans virtually. Throughout 2020, Grassley met with more than 800 groups of Iowans and discussed a variety of policy issues such as trade, tax reform, prescription drug pricing as well as the many issues that have arisen during the pandemic. Grassley also joined Iowa schools for Q&As via video conferencing and, as an avid fan of Iowa universities, cheered on dozens of student-athletes at sporting events.This year, Grassley became the 10th longest-serving U.S Senator in history and continued his constitutional duty serving as the Senate president pro tempore, a position historically bestowed upon the most senior member of the majority party in the upper chamber of Congress. Upon his swearing in, Grassley became third in the line of presidential succession following the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives. An Iowan has not held this position since Senator Albert B. Cummins in 1919. In his capacity as president pro tempore, Grassley aided in the selection process of the new Architect of the Capitol and nominated an Iowan to the U.S Senate Curatorial Advisory board. He also played a role in many historic events this year including welcoming President Donald Trump into the chamber of the House of Representatives for the 68th annual State of the Union address and signing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.Highlights of Grassley’s legislative and oversight work follow here:Agriculture:This year was particularly tough on the farming industry due to commodity prices taking a hit from the novel coronavirus, drought across West Central Iowa and an intense windstorm known as a derecho that caused widespread damage across central Iowa. However, through it all, farmers continued to plow ahead and support their communities. As the senior senator of one of the top agricultural states in the country and a family farmer, Grassley has been an outspoken advocate for farmers and Rural America.Throughout the various spending negotiations in Congress, Grassley was a staunch defender of family farms. He led the Iowa Congressional delegation in urging Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to ensure funds for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were replenished in the next government funding bill. He exposed Democrats for blocking crucial coronavirus relief, which included billions of dollars in assistance for farmers and agribusiness employees.When COVID-19 began affecting our meat supply chain, Grassley immediately raised concerns with his colleagues. Grassley has long focused on consolidation in the meatpacking industry and pressed USDA to protect independent producers. In May, Grassley introduced bipartisan legislation that would foster efficient markets and improve competition and transparency among packers that purchase cattle. Grassley first introduced this bill in 2002. The bill will require a minimum of 50 percent of a packer's weekly volume of beef slaughter to come as a result of purchases made on the open or spot market.While many around the country noticed higher prices at the grocery store due to these market disruptions, many cattle producers across the country could not get a bid on their animals. Grassley was one of the first lawmakers to seek an investigation to bring more transparency to the cattle industry. He called on the Departments of Justice and Agriculture to investigate potential market manipulation and other illegal activity by large meat packing companies in the cattle industry. President Trump echoed this call for an investigation into possible anticompetitive behavior in the beef industry.In June, Grassley sent a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue relaying the frustration of farmers about the lack of enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, and called for the report on the Holcomb, Kansas, fire to be released by August 9, 2020, or he would seek an audit of the USDA’s enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Division. USDA took this issue seriously and released its report echoing the need for more transparency in the industry. Additionally, he partnered with Sen. Tester in sending a letter to Secretary Perdue recommending the department clarify an ambiguous proposed rule regarding the undue and reasonable preferences provision of the Packers and Stockyards Act.This year, Grassley also joined Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Securing All Livestock Equitably (SALE) Act. Quick turnaround between the purchase and resale of cattle by a dealer often leaves the rancher who originally owned the cattle with little recourse if a dealer defaults on a purchase because the livestock has often already been resold. The SALE Act would establish dealer statutory trusts, mimicking existing packer statutory trusts, for the purpose of ensuring that cattle sellers receive payment should a livestock dealer become insolvent.Pork producers around the country faced significant challenges this year due to pork processing plant closures. Grassley joined his colleagues Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C ) and Richard Burr (R-N.C ) in introducing the Responding to Epidemic Losses and Investing in the Economic Future (RELIEF) for Producers Act of 2020, legislation that would provide relief to livestock and poultry producers amidst the coronavirus pandemic.Grassley joined 30 members of Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral letter urging USDA Secretary Perdue to take immediate action to assist pork producers and maintain the pork food supply chain. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, Grassley led his colleagues in sending an additional letter to USDA to recommend additional funding for farmers being forced to depopulate their livestock herds. Farmers faced an animal welfare crisis due to overcrowding and the challenge of providing enough feed and water available to each animal. Grassley also joined Iowa leaders, Sen. Joni Ernst, Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig in sending a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and requested additional support from the Administration for the state’s pork producers.In addition to livestock farmers, Grassley urged his colleagues to support dairy farmers around the country. Additionally, he joined Sen. Ernst, Gov. Reynolds, and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Naig in requesting the USDA to include egg producers and turkey producers in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). In the second round of CFAP payments, both egg and turkey producers were eligible.To make sure tax dollars are spent as intended to benefit the farmers who actually work the land instead of managers or corporations, Grassley has been a longtime advocate for farm payment limitations. This year, USDA initially announced a final rule on the implementation of payment limitations and the definition of “actively engaged” in farming as part of the 2018 Farm Bill, which would have required additional family members to provide either 25 percent of the total management hours required by the operation on an annual basis or perform at least 500 hours of management annually. Unfortunately, USDA recently reversed this rule. Prior to this reversal, Grassley requested an additional GAO review of the program. The GAO report concluded that while USDA has improved its completion of eligibility compliance review, additional oversight is needed. Grassley will continue his fight to close loopholes that have allowed some operations to exploit federal farm payments at taxpayer expense.Grassley joined the only other farmer in the U.S Senate, Jon Tester (D-Montana), to address farmer mental health. Grassley and Tester authored the Seeding Rural Resilience Act which aims to curb growing rates of suicide in Rural America by implementing a voluntary stress management training program, creating a public service announcement campaign to raise awareness and directing the Secretary of Agriculture to work with state and local groups to identify best practices when responding to farm mental stress. This bill was successfully voted out of the Senate this summer and later became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.Diseases like African swine fever have the potential to devastate entire sectors of U.S agriculture. With that in mind, Grassley cosponsored the Protecting America’s Food & Agriculture Act of 2019 to address the shortage of agricultural inspectors who protect the nation’s food supply and agricultural industries at the border. This legislation was signed into law by President Trump earlier this year.This year, the Trump administration kept its promise and successfully rolled back the harmful Obama-era “Waters of the United States” or “WOTUS” rule and replaced it with a workable rule that clearly defines what waters fall under federal jurisdiction. Grassley was a steadfast opponent of the original rule, which would have regulated 97 percent of Iowa farmland as a navigable waterway. This regulatory certainty will continue to help spur economic growth in Iowa and around the country while also ensuring individual property rights are protected.Enhancing water quality is critical to meeting the goals of Iowa’s Nutrient Reduction Strategy and making improvements to Iowa’s river and stream health. With that in mind, Grassley joined Sen. Ernst and a bipartisan group of senators to urge the USDA to make several changes to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to maximize the program’s ability for producers to use the program to enhance both soil health and water quality.Grassley also celebrated Thanksgiving this year by praising an Iowa family whose turkeys were chosen for the National Thanksgiving Turkey Pardoning Ceremony at the White House.Antitrust:Grassley joined Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C ) to introduce the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules (SMARTER) Act. This bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to go through the same procedures that the Department of Justice (DOJ) must go through when enforcing antitrust law, and would require the Federal Communications Commission to issue merger review decisions expeditiously.Grassley also partnered with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in introducing the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act which extends whistleblower protections for employees who provide information to DOJ related to criminal antitrust violations. The Senate unanimously passed a similar version of the legislation in 2013, 2015 and 2017. This year, the legislation passed in both the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Trump in December.COVID-19:In February, when the world was just learning about COVID-19, oversight and investigations staff for Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), received a classified briefing from the HHS Office of National Security (ONS) regarding the coronavirus threat and the status of U.S government efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus.In the early stages of the pandemic, Grassley urged further information sharing between federal health and intelligence agencies to strengthen the governmental response to the COVID-19 public health crisis and future health concerns. In April, he also joined colleagues in urging the executive branch to make relief assistance to long-term care facilities a top priority.Grassley also was named to the bipartisan task force focused on safely re-opening America following the public health crisis. The task force includes Democrat and Republican members of both the U.S Senate and House of Representatives.Grassley was an original proponent of an emergency supplemental appropriations bill providing funding to combat the spread of COVID-19. The funding package amounts to an $8.3 billion surge in resources to combat COVID-19 and provides comprehensive funding for efforts on the local, state, national and international levels.In March, Governor Reynolds declared a State of Public Health Emergency as confirmed COVID-19 cases rose. Grassley sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking that he promptly grant the Governor’s request for an expedited review of the major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa as a result of multiple cases of COVID-19 detected in the state.As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Grassley authored several provisions that would eventually be included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This bill passed out of the Senate 96-0 and provided direct economic relief to American families, workers, employers and health care providers coping with the coronavirus pandemic.Along with direct payments to individuals and families, the CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance benefit benefits for jobless workers, and lending programs for businesses of all sizes. The bipartisan package developed targeted, temporary tax relief to help businesses and hospitals continue operations. One-size-fits-all is not the way the U.S economy operates, and yet nearly every sector is bearing the burden of social distancing and stay-at-home orders across the country.Small businesses across the country were hit particularly hard by associated COVID-19 restrictions. To address this, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act to help keep workers on the payroll by providing small businesses forgivable loans to cover payroll expenses. As the pandemic worsened, Grassley worked with his colleagues to provide additional funding to this program. While the Senate Democrats originally tried to block it, the additional funding later successfully went through. Grassley also worked with the Department of Treasury and the Small Business Administration on clarifying terms and eligibility of the program for Iowa businesses and bankers.For example, Grassley partnered with Finance Committee Ranking Member, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) urging the Department of Treasury to allow small businesses to deduct expenses associated with PPP loans that are ultimately forgiven. Ultimately, Grassley and many of his colleagues disagreed with Treasury’s final guidance.Grassley worked with his colleagues to ensure the rural economy reaped the benefits of the CARES Act including additional funding for rural health centers, providers, programs, telehealth services and related infrastructure. Grassley also worked to secure relief for American agriculture. He worked to include $23.5 billion in the CARES Act to send emergency temporary relief to farm country to help survive the fall-out caused by the pandemic. Specifically, it set aside $9.5 billion for the USDA to directly support farmers and ranchers. The CARES Act also replenishes the Commodity Credit Corporation with $14 billion. Grassley called upon USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to use some of these additional funds to help support the biofuels industry, including resources for higher blends infrastructure at filling stations and to leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to buy excess farm commodities and replenish food pantries and nutrition programs across the nation. He then introduced legislation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar to make this a requirement.Overall, the CARES Act provided much-needed relief to help Americans, including workers, seniors and student borrowers.On December 21, the Senate passed an additional large legislative package including COVID-19 relief and economic stimulus, tax and health care policy extensions and government funding. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley championed several provisions including expanding unemployment insurance benefits, additional economic impact payments for individuals and families and extension of certain expiring provisions for families as well as small- and medium-sized businesses around the country. Additionally, under the Senate Finance Committee’s jurisdiction, this package extends a number of important Medicare, Medicaid and other health policies, including boosting payments to doctors in Iowa and other rural areas. It also provides permanent coverage for mental health telehealth visits, which are helpful during the pandemic and will remain critical for many Americans afterward. And, it extends the period over which state and local governments can use money from the Coronavirus Relief Fund provided under the CARES Act by one year, giving more flexibility to state and local governments as they face spending challenges caused by the pandemic. It also provides additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Grassley’s full statement on the legislative package and further details on what is included can be found HERE.Grassley joined Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H ) to introduce the bipartisan State and Local Coronavirus Relief Fund Extension Act to extend the year-end deadline for states to use federal CARES Act assistance, as well as any future funding to state and local governments, through 2021. The goal of this bill is to provide flexibility in uses of Coronavirus Relief Fund resources by allowing spending by states, localities, territories, and tribes on coronavirus responses to be covered over a longer period of time.Following implementation of the CARES Act, Grassley worked with his colleagues to craft an additional targeted relief package known as the HEALS Act. Unfortunately, both Senate and House Democrats refused to move forward with this legislation. Senate Democrats voted twice to block the legislation in the Senate. The HEALS Act would have provided relief measures supported on a bipartisan basis, such as providing additional funds for unemployment benefits, the Paycheck Protection Program, education, voting, state and local governments, recovery checks, and hiring and employee retention incentives.Throughout the funding negotiations, Grassley worked to ensure the COVID-19 relief funds would go to those who actually needed it. With that in mind, Grassley introduced the COVID-19 Funding Accountability Act. This legislation would impose strict congressional oversight over the implementation of various funding in the CARES Act as well as create bipartisan oversight boards.Grassley criticized his Democratic colleagues when they wanted to impose a quarter of a trillion dollar retroactive tax increase on businesses in need of cash to restart their operations as states began to lift shut-down orders.Grassley also worked with Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C ) in introducing a bill to protect recovery payments provided in the recent CARES Act pandemic response legislation from garnishment by private debt collectors.Grassley has been a longtime watchdog of waste, fraud and abuse. Unfortunately, throughout this pandemic, fraudsters have taken advantage of the American public through a variety of scams. Grassley wrote to the U.S Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) encouraging the IRS watchdog to engage in a public awareness and education campaign informing Americans of scams and frauds related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the federal government’s response.Grassley also partnered with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to call on DOJ to take vigorous action to protect consumers from price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic and help prevent the hoarding of essential medical supplies.As COVID-19 affected areas of the country in different ways and at different times, Grassley applauded Gov. Reynolds’ work to combat the virus. As hardship hit more Iowans and events were canceled, he urged Iowans to stay at home and do their part to slow the spread.Although Grassley took all of the appropriate and recommended precautions, the senator tested positive for COVID-19 after learning of an earlier exposure. Grassley quarantined per CDC and local public health guidelines and at the recommendation of his doctors. Due to his quarantine, Grassley was unable to cast votes on the Senate floor for the first time in 27 years. Grassley has cast 8,927 consecutive votes and continues to hold the record for longest length of time without missing a vote in the history of the Senate. Ultimately, Grassley was asymptomatic throughout his quarantine and was cleared to return to work by his doctors.Crime and Criminal Justice:All Americans have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including inmates in the state and federal prison system. Grassley and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the lead authors of the bipartisan First Step Act (FSA), led 12 of their colleagues in a bipartisan letter pressing DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to take necessary steps to protect the health and wellbeing of federal prison staff and inmates in Federal custody. They urged the release or transfer of the most vulnerable inmates to home confinement as permitted under the FSA. The senators called on BOP and DOJ to review and expedite current cases where the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program would allow for an early transfer – where appropriate – of terminally ill and eligible elderly inmates to home confinement. In April, Grassley and Durbin sent a follow up letter to the DOJ Inspector General’s (IG) regarding its decision to assess whether facilities housing BOP inmates are complying with available guidance and best practices regarding preventing, managing, and containing potential COVID-19 outbreaks and asked them to expand the probe.As a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley also participated in a hearing titled, “Examining Best Practices for Incarceration and Detention During COVID-19,” where he pressed DOJ and BOP officials on the use of home confinement and adherence to CDC guidelines on social distancing, use of personal protective equipment, and other risk mitigation efforts in correctional facilities.Also, in an effort to protect the most vulnerable inmates in our society, Grassley and Durbin introduced the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act. This bill expands eligibility for and provides judicial review of the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program, and also provides for the compassionate release of federal prisoners based on COVID-19 vulnerability and shortens the waiting period of judicial review during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Senator Grassley also led a letter to the Justice Department about its handling of COVID-19 in juvenile detention facilities. Along with Sens. Whitehouse and Ernst, Grassley urged the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to equip the juvenile justice system with consistent, reliable, and transparent information to help mitigate the impact of the virus on vulnerable youth.Grassley continued his work to protect children from predators online through his co-sponsorship of the EARN IT Act. This bill creates incentives for the tech industry to address online child sexual exploitation, by removing blanket immunity in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It also establishes a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention that will be responsible for developing voluntary best practices.Lastly, Grassley reintroduced the Deterring Undue Enforcement by Protecting Rights of Citizens from Excessive Searches and Seizures Act of 2020, or the DUE PROCESS Act. This bipartisan bill seeks to protect property owners whose assets are seized by the federal government by increasing transparency and accountability in asset forfeiture proceedings.Defense Oversight:Grassley’s extensive oversight work throughout his career has included a dogged pursuit for answers from the Pentagon over decades of wasteful spending and its inability to produce a clean financial audit.Grassley has conducted oversight to hold the DoD accountable for over four decades. He continued to press the Department on the new Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program, alleged conflicts of interest pertaining to those charged with creating its bid and reported disputes between bidders and the Department. This comes after the Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed a review and provided recommendations in response to Grassley and members of Congress raising concerns about the JEDI program. Last year, Grassley sent a letter to then Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, seeking information on Department policies intended to mitigate conflicts of interest and prevent the tailoring of procurement requests to match a specific vendor, as alleged in the JEDI program procurement process.Grassley and several of his colleagues sent a letter to GAO in July 2018 requesting the agency conduct an independent review of the reasons behind the DoD’s failure to acquire modern financial information technology systems capable of generating reliable information and supporting credible financial statements. The report was released in September and reaffirmed Grassley’s longtime concerns about financial mismanagement and waste at the DoD. The Department is working towards a clean audit and updating its financial management systems. However, it’s clear from this report the Pentagon has a long way to go.Grassley, along with the other requestors of the GAO report and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), also sent a letter earlier this year to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, urging them to include in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2021 certain provisions that would make progress towards a clean audit, including more detailed reporting to Congress on DoD financial management systems. Both of the provisions were ultimately included in the final version of the NDAA.Earlier this year, Grassley renewed inquiries into potential wasteful and inappropriate travel spending at the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), specifically seeking full and complete answers to prior questions about multiple trips to Hawaii.Grassley joined Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y ) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to reintroduce the Military Justice Improvement Act in response to reports of mishandling military sexual assaults.Grassley and Gillibrand also introduced bipartisan legislation to require the military to establish a “Safe to Report” policy. According to a Department of Defense report, in fiscal year 2018, only 30% of sexual assaults in the military were reported. Studies show more survivors are empowered to come forward without the threat of retaliation, and the Safe to Report Act empowers survivors of sexual violence to report these incidents without fear of collateral misconduct charges for minor offenses. This legislation was included in the final version of the NDAA.Also included in the NDAA was a provision that Grassley championed along with other members of the Iowa and Illinois delegation that seeks to improve Army real-estate management. The provision establishes a pilot program to create an online real-estate management system at several Army installations, with the goal of helping the military and federal government use existing resources more efficiently.Additionally, Grassley expanded his probe into the Department’s Office of Net Assessment’s (ONA) contract compliance after reviewing troubling documents related to contracts awarded to Professor Stefan Halper. Those documents call into question ONA’s stewardship of taxpayer dollars as well as its contract management and internal controls. In early 2019, Grassley requested the DoD Inspector General (IG) review allegations of mismanagement by ONA contracts for political, improper or wasteful activities. Grassley later sought information about ONA contracting processes following a DoD IG audit of the program, which found ONA could not provide sufficient documentation that Halper conducted all of his work in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Pentagon issued a corrective action plan for ONA in August.On January 23, 2020, Grassley sought an inspector general investigation into the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martin’s C-130J aircraft after whistleblower reports alleged a lack of oversight by the DoD has resulted in significant health and safety concerns. On October 8, 2020, Grassley sought additional information from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martin’s C-130J after learning of discrepancies in the initial investigation.Derecho Recovery:From year to year, natural disasters take place across the country. In August, many Iowans experienced a historic derecho. Immediately after the storm hit, Grassley visited Cedar Rapids to survey damage, meet with residents affected by the storm and visit a local nonprofit assisting in relief efforts. Grassley and Ernst also participated in a roundtable discussion with 20 nonprofit leaders and the Cedar Rapids Community Foundation. The local nonprofits assisted with housing, case management, mental health, volunteer coordination, food access and legal assistance.Grassley and Ernst worked with Gov. Reynolds to ensure Iowans would be eligible for federal support including a major disaster declaration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Individual Assistance Program.Iowa’s agricultural community faced significant damage and new challenges resulting from the storm. Grassley led the Iowa congressional delegation in sending a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue urging a prompt approval of Gov. Reynolds Secretarial Disaster Designation request for 57 Iowa counties that suffered losses as a result of the derecho. Following this request, Grassley and Ernst sent an additional letter to USDA requesting it provide additional support for Iowa farmers impacted by the derecho and severe drought. They also sent a letter requesting additional funding for Iowa agricultural cooperatives.In addition to tens of millions of acres of damaged crops, grain bins across the state were destroyed. Grassley and Ernst requested the U.S Department of Commerce lift Section 232 tariffs on steel that will be used in Iowa’s derecho recovery, especially on steel used for rebuilding grain bins and machine sheds.Grassley worked with Ernst to file legislation to provide tax relief to Iowans affected by the derecho. The legislation would provide certain employers a tax credit for retaining employees, enhance the tax deduction for disaster-related personal casualty losses, and facilitate enhanced access to tax-exempt retirement plans, among other benefits.Additionally, Grassley and Ernst worked to ensure Iowans affected by the derecho weren’t victims of fraud. They sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate price-gouging scams.DOJ/FBI:Grassley and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) continued their investigation into the fatal shooting of Bijan Ghaisar by U.S Park Police in 2017. Grassley first contacted the FBI in December 2018 about its investigation into the shooting, and the FBI responded in March with little information, prompting a follow-up letter from Grassley. Since then the senators also have pressed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide details on specific reforms being implemented to avoid a repeat of its drawn-out and opaque investigation of U.S Park Police’s fatal shooting of Bijan Ghaisar.This legislative session, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, persistently contacted U.S Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray to investigate the origins of the FBI’s Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane, to bring transparency to FBI mismanagement. Grassley has long been skeptical of the FBI’s justification to spy on Carter Page, including its reliance on the debunked anti-Trump dossier, which was compiled by a former British spy, sub-sourced to Russian officials and paid for by then-candidate Trump’s Democrat political opponents. The DOJ inspector general determined the dossier to be central and essential to the FBI’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application. The inspector general also determined the FBI’s applications included at least 17 errors and omissions and over 50 errors and omissions in the Woods File. After further reviewing the DOJ OIG report on Crossfire Hurricane, Grassley and Johnson sent Barr a follow up letter requesting the declassification of four footnotes in the report on FISA abuses in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Those footnotes were later declassified and showed how Russian disinformation infected the Steele Dossier.On April 25, 2019, Grassley and Johnson wrote to the DOJ regarding the FBI and how it may have used a counterintelligence briefing to conduct surveillance on the Trump transition team during Crossfire Hurricane.In April, Grassley and Johnson requested additional Crossfire Hurricane records after the declassified footnotes revealed the Steele Dossier contained reported Russian disinformation.On May 12, 2020, Grassley and Johnson requested a list of Obama-era officials that unmasked Lt. Gen. Flynn. In response, the Intelligence Community provided a list that included then-Vice President Biden as one of the Obama-era officials that requested to unmask Flynn.In November, Grassley and Johnson also sent a letter to Barr requesting the full declassification of briefing notes for then-Director James Comey summarizing the FBI’s investigative efforts regarding Crossfire Hurricane.On October 13, 2020, Grassley and Johnson also sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray warning the bureau’s recent production of limited text messages from former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was unacceptable and the FBI must produce all records in compliance with previous requests.On October 15, 2020, Grassley and Johnson sent another letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe seeking an unredacted version of a spreadsheet created to attempt to corroborate allegations made in the discredited Steele Dossier.Grassley and Johnson also released a majority staff report detailing how the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Office secretly sought and received access to the private records of Donald J. Trump’s presidential transition team, Trump for America, Inc., despite an agreement between the Trump transition team and the General Services Administration that those records were the transition team’s private property that would not be retained at the conclusion of the transition. Grassley also pressed DOJ for details on steps taken to recover material deleted from mobile devices assigned to Mueller’s team, and investigate potential violations of federal record keeping laws. Many of those deletions occurred after the agency watchdog discovered anti-Trump texts on then-FBI agent Peter Strzok’s government-issued phone, and after the DOJ IG began reviewing the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.On December 1, 2020, news broke that Barr had appointed U.S Attorney John Durham to be special counsel in his ongoing review of the origins of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Grassley praised this decision.On December 3, 2020, Grassley and Johnson released over 400 pages of records acquired from the DOJ, FBI and State Department during their investigation into the FBI’s mishandling of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The production includes recently declassified material that illustrate the flawed decision-making process by federal officials during Crossfire Hurricane.As part of Grassley’s ongoing FARA oversight, he called on the Justice Department to evaluate whether Hunter and James Biden should have registered as foreign agents for their business arrangements with the Chinese government-back energy company CEFC, in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The company was actively seeking to build influence in the United States when it partnered with the Bidens.Drug Prices:Grassley has long raised concerns about lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry and the prescription drug supply chain. This year, he also highlighted high prescription drug prices and the concerning trend that the price of many medications are increasing faster than inflation.One of Grassley’s top priorities has been to address the rising costs of prescription drugs. Last year, with Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.) he introduced the bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act (PDPRA). According to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, PDPRA would save taxpayers $95 billion, reduce out-of-pocket spending by $72 billion and reduce premiums by $1 billion. It would also provide peace of mind to millions of seniors and make common, everyday prescriptions, like insulin, more affordable. Unfortunately, Democrats changed their minds and walked away from the negotiating table. Grassley moved forward with his efforts and introduced an updated bill that had growing support from many Republicans including Ernst. President Trump also highlighted this legislation at the annual State of the Union Address and has supported efforts to address prescription drug pricing.The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for prescription drug pricing reform. As new treatments and therapies enter the marketplace, the American people will want the best medical cures at prices they can afford to pay. PDPRA would help reduce drug prices and secure scientific innovation in a post-pandemic world for generations to come.As the Senate crafted COVID-19 relief funding, Grassley again urged his colleagues to address prescription drug pricing and include PDPRA in any future relief legislation.As researchers around the world are racing to find a vaccine to combat COVID-19, Grassley welcomed news from Pfizer and Operation Warp Speed accelerating the response to end the pandemic.As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley and Wyden also partnered on a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices. They sent letters to leading insulin manufacturers, seeking information regarding recent price increases of up to 500% or more for insulin, a treatment available for diabetes for nearly 100 years. This year, they expanded that investigation and warned those companies that were not cooperating.Grassley also joined several of his colleagues in introducing the PRICE Transparency Act. This legislation would codify the two health care price transparency rules that came out of President Trump’s Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare Executive Order which requires hospitals and insurers to reveal their low, discounted cash prices and negotiated rates to consumers before they receive medical care.President Trump made prescription drug affordability one of his top priorities. He announced executive orders encouraging domestic manufacturing of drugs and other medical goods critical to public health. Additionally, President Trump worked to address the rising costs of insulin and announced a new Medicare Part D initiative to lower out of pocket insulin expenses for seniors.On June 2, 2020, Grassley chaired a hearing titled, “COVID-19 and Beyond: Oversight of the FDA’s Foreign Drug Manufacturing Inspection Process. ” The hearing was based on Grassley’s oversight work on the FDA’s foreign drug manufacturing facility inspection process and highlighted the risks associated with drugs manufactured in foreign countries, especially China, and imported to the United States. At the hearing, Grassley introduced into the Committee record thousands of pages of records that he acquired during his FDA investigation relating to China- and India-based drug manufacturing facilities.Over the years, Grassley has called on pharmaceutical companies to list prices of their prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertisements. In 2019, HHS made good on the promise and finalized a rule requiring price disclosure on TV ads for prescription drugs. However, that rule was challenged by pharmaceutical companies in court and recently overturned. Grassley will continue working to increase transparency from pharmaceutical companies.Education:Grassley continued to confront the issue of academic freedom this year. In 2019, he sent letters to the presidents of Duke University, Harvard University, Sarah Lawrence College and Villanova University, seeking information on the current culture of academic freedom on campus. This fall, Grassley followed up on that issue by sending a letter to his colleagues discussing the responses of those colleges and universities. In that letter, he stated the mission of colleges and universities should be to develop the character of young adults by challenging them with new ideas rather than making them feel “safe. ” Grassley concluded his letter by stating, “[O]ur colleges and universities must ensure that their professors can freely teach their students and that students are free to learn, without retribution. ”Grassley also continued his oversight work relating to Confucius Institutes and urged colleges and universities around the country to request an FBI briefing to fully understand the academic research and national security threats posed by the Chinese government-backed organizations operating on campus. In addition to this letter, Grassley supported the Concerns Over Nations Funding University Campus Institutes in the United States (CONFUCIUS) Act which passed the Senate in July. Grassley has long warned that China leverages its presence in American colleges and universities to spread pro-China propaganda and steal intellectual property.While working in Washington, Grassley highlighted Iowa’s academic excellence for his colleagues. He praised the state’s highest four-year graduation rate in Iowa’s history, at 91.6 percent. He also applauded the University of Iowa’s independent newspaper, The Daily Iowan, which was named the Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.Election Integrity:With another presidential election in 2020, the spotlight was once again on Iowa and the first in the nation caucuses. The Iowa caucuses are an example of grassroots democracy. While not every part of the caucus went according to plan this year, Grassley joined Ernst and Gov. Reynolds in supporting the integrity of the process and demonstrated the seriousness Iowans take in their civic duty.The COVID-19 pandemic presented many unique challenges in 2020. However, election officials around the country worked diligently to ensure a safe and secure election this November. In Iowa, Secretary of State Paul Pate mailed an absentee ballot request form to every registered Iowa voter for the November election and the state saw a record turnout.Grassley urged his colleagues not to play political games with election security. He also commended the Treasury Department’s announced sanctions on Russian-aligned actors seeking to influence the 2020 U.S presidential election.Congress in March unanimously approved a $10 billion loan for the U.S Postal Service to respond to pandemic-related uncertainties. However, the USPS assured lawmakers that it had enough cash on hand to maintain operations through next year even without that loan. In fact, the USPS reported a record amount of cash on hand due to the increase in package deliveries during the pandemic. Even with this additional bipartisan funding, many Democrats continued to undermine faith in the electoral process. Grassley strongly condemned such statements on the Senate floor.Energy:As a champion of renewable fuels and an all-of-the-above American energy policy, Grassley continued his extensive work to enact responsible energy policies throughout 2020. Grassley was a leader in the effort to allow the sale of year-round E15.Grassley has continued to lead the fight to maintain a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). He led efforts to pressure the EPA to stop issuing “hardship waivers” to obligated refiners as well as make the waiver process more transparent and highlighted the importance of the RFS to President Trump. Grassley joined Ernst in voting against Mark Menezes, nominated to be Deputy Secretary of Energy due to lack of transparency among the agencies.Much of Grassley’s energy agenda focused on the RFS. Grassley worked extensively with Senate colleagues, President Trump and the EPA to expand renewable energy and fulfill congressional intent on the RFS. This year, Grassley slammed the proposed Zero-Emission Vehicles Act which would require 50 percent of sales for new passenger vehicles to be all electric by 2025 and mandate 100 percent of new sales for the U.S passenger transportation fleet by 2035.Grassley also joined his colleagues in sending a letter to urge the EPA to modernize its rulemaking for biogenic carbon emissions.Grassley joined his partner in the Senate, Ernst, in sending a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting clarification on its temporary policy for the manufacture of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than wait for the economy to rebound, biofuel producers across Iowa shifted production to manufacture hand sanitizer to help meet the needs of their communities across the state.Last year, Grassley and Ernst fought hard to include the biodiesel tax credit in the year-end funding package. In February, the two Iowa senators called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to promptly process 2018-2019 biodiesel tax credit claims.In addition to ethanol and biodiesel, Grassley highlighted the importance of wind energy in Iowa and around the country.Grassley also worked to hold Big Oil accountable this year. He joined Sen. Udall (D-N.M ) in introducing the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act of 2020 to modernize the country’s antiquated public lands royalty system and increase return to federal and state taxpayers by $200 million in the next decade.Federal Judiciary:As a former chairman and senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley rigorously vetted and reviewed judicial nominations to ensure our federal judges will interpret and apply the law as written, not legislate from the bench based on policy preferences.President Trump has made an effort to nominate constitutionalist and textualist judges who understand the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system. Under Grassley’s leadership, the Judiciary Committee oversaw the confirmation of a record 30 circuit court judges, which is the most circuit court confirmations in the first two years of any presidency in history, and in 2020, the Senate has confirmed a record number of circuit court nominees. These confirmations will have an important impact on our country for decades to come.Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away in September, leaving behind a historic legacy that will live on for generations. With an opening on the highest court in the land, Grassley supported Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C ) in moving forward to fill the vacancy. In 2016, citing a divided government, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and his committee colleagues exercised their constitutional authority to withhold consent on any nominee prior to the completion of the election. The circumstances were different in 2020, where the American people elected a Republican President and Senate in 2016 and expanded the Republican Senate majority in 2018.Later that month, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Grassley met with Judge Barrett and vetted her credentials. Grassley strongly supported Judge Barrett in the hearings and urged his colleagues to support her in the final vote before the full senate. In late October, the Senate approved Judge Barrett’s nomination by a vote of 52-48. As Senate President pro tempore, Grassley presided over the vote.Throughout Justice Barrett’s confirmation process, he admonished Democrats who were threatening to pack the courts with partisan judges.Throughout the pandemic, the Supreme Court allowed live audio streams of oral arguments conducted via teleconference following pandemic-induced lockdowns. The unprecedented live audio feed broadened access to real-time proceedings far beyond the Court’s limited seating capacity even in normal times. The move sparked widespread praise from transparency advocates and the general public. Grassley and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) renewed their push to allow live video coverage of court proceedings even after the pandemic restrictions are lifted.Foster youth, adoption, families and elder care:Throughout his congressional career, Grassley has advocated for children and families. He continued his work on these issues in 2020 by developing policies aimed at protecting special needs children, preventing elder abuse, encouraging elder independence and promoting funding for programs to improve family health.Grassley has long been a leader in the effort to protect older Americans, especially those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Grassley has helped lead congressional oversight of nursing homes and their response to the deadly pandemic.In April, Grassley wrote to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma regarding several issues related to the outbreak of COVID-19 at long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the country. Grassley expressed concerns about testing capacity, inconsistencies in data tracking, a lack of PPE and transparency in federal spending. Following Grassley’s call on CMS to require nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to report all cases of COVID-19 to the federal government, the agency took such steps to ensure transparency and usable data.In July, Grassley and Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) introduced the Emergency Support for Nursing Homes and Elder Justice Reform Act of 2020, which would improve existing programs to protect older Americans and provide help to nursing homes and their staff providing care for vulnerable residents. The legislation includes several provisions to help nursing homes manage COVID-19 outbreaks, including the establishment of specialty regional “strike teams” and extends COVID-19 related reporting requirements through the end of 2020. The bill calls on states receiving federal relief assistance to devote some funding to tele-visitation programs so nursing home residents aren’t isolated from family throughout the pandemic. It also renews and reauthorizes funding for several programs enacted in the Elder Justice Act of 2009 and boosts transparency and accountability measures for underperforming nursing homes.Following the Trump administration’s announcement that it would require weekly testing of nursing home staffers and the disbursement of an additional $5 billion in funding to these facilities, Grassley praised the action as a big step in the right direction, which will help further protect the lives and health of both the residents of nursing facilities and the dedicated staff who care for them.As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley continued his oversight work and released a comprehensive report on care in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in the United States during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The report, titled “COVID-19 and Nursing Homes: What Went Wrong and Next Steps,” reviews U.S nursing home performance during the first eight months of the pandemic.He also sent a letter to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at HHS requesting the OIG initiate an investigation into whether or not five states – California, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania – violated federal guidance in pressuring nursing home facilities to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19.This year, Grassley also joined a bipartisan resolution designating May 15, 2020 as “National Senior Fraud Awareness Day,” to draw attention to the issues of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. He also authored a resolution recognizing National Foster Care Month, to boost awareness of challenges faced by children in the foster care system. Both passed the Senate unanimously.Grassley also celebrated National Adoption Month in 2020 and highlighted the unique challenges families have faced throughout the pandemic.Grassley partnered with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J ), to protect seniors with dementia from harm and exploitation. The Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act successfully passed out of the Senate and would ensure the Department of Justice’s elder abuse training materials take into account individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.Grassley has spent decades advocating on behalf of older Americans and families of children with special needs and complex medical conditions and authored key provisions in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that was enacted 30 years ago.Grassley, in his capacity as Senate Finance Committee Chairman, convened a bipartisan working group to address federal paid family leave policies. The working group considered ideas and principles relating to the issue of paid family leave and reviewed existing legislation introduced by several senators on and off the committee and from both parties.In the year-end COVID-19 economic relief and funding legislative package, Grassley advocated for additional support for the elder community. This legislation included $100 million to support elder justice initiatives, including 50 million for state adult protective service agencies as they cope with unique challenges of serving vulnerable populations during the pandemic.Good Government and Transparency:Grassley has been a longtime advocate for inspectors general and government oversight regardless of political party and administration. On April 8, 2020, Grassley led a bipartisan group of lawmakers in calling on President Trump to provide a detailed written explanation for his decision to remove an inspector general. In the letter, the lawmakers underscore the important role inspectors general play in holding agencies accountable and outline the removal procedures, which are designed to prevent political interference. This comes after two inspectors generals were terminated this spring.On April 14, 2020, Grassley and Wyden wrote to Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, in his role as chair of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), regarding CIGIE’s role in the inspector general nominating process. They inquired about the CIGIE recommendation process, the consistency of its advice to the White House, the rate at which its advice is taken by the White House and how often CIGIE has expressed concerns about IG vacancies.Following complaints from dozens of whistleblowers, Grassley and his colleagues also continued their investigation into whistleblower allegations of low morale and low productivity at the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General.Additionally, Grassley led a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to boost oversight of trillions in taxpayer funded pandemic relief by helping the special watchdog quickly onboard critical oversight staff. The Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery Expedited Hiring Authority Act allows the office to bypass the lengthy government hiring process so it can quickly ramp up oversight operations. On December 15, Grassley called on his colleagues to get down to business and pass this bill.On October 6, 2020, Grassley led a bipartisan letter to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Conference urging the protection of the work of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). The Senate-passed version of the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included language that would have limited SIGAR’s jurisdiction to just six reconstruction funds and severely restricted SIGAR’s oversight of reconstruction spending, to exclude oversight authority over internationally monitored trust funds like the World-Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, military construction, human rights and anti-corruption assistance, and certain counternarcotics programs. This section was removed from the House and Senate Conference NDAA, preserving SIGAR’s oversight authority over crucial overseas funds.Grassley joined his colleagues, Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to change the authority of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to conduct a thorough and rigorous review of independent agencies’ regulations. Currently, independent agencies are not required to undergo a review by OIRA. They wrote, in part, “Although these agencies have been created with certain protections designed to insulate them from the political process, they are not a fourth branch of government that is exempt from Congressional and Executive oversight. ”On February 5, 2020 Grassley and Johnson sought records of Hunter Biden’s travel while he was under U.S Secret Service protection as part of their investigation into potential conflicts of interest among the Biden family when Joe Biden was Vice President.Grassley and Johnson faced unhelpful challenges from their Democratic colleagues regarding their oversight work. In February they rebuked their colleagues who attempted to undermine legitimate oversight by selectively leaking information from their Biden investigation. In August, they urged their colleagues to stop falsely claiming the Ukraine/Biden investigation was subject to Russian disinformation.On September 23, 2020, Grassley and Johnson released a report that revealed millions of dollars in questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals, including individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. They later released a supplemental report with new information which confirmed connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese government, as well as the links between Hunter Biden’s business associates and the Russian government.In October, news broke referencing an alleged Hunter Biden laptop with additional pertinent information relating to Grassley and Johnson’s investigation. They immediately sent a letter to United States Secret Service Director James Murray highlighting references to Hunter Biden’s travel from recently published emails that appear to align with Secret Service records previously produced to the committees. The chairmen also requested records to verify whether the Secret Service traveled with Hunter Biden after he apparently discontinued his protective detail.Grassley joined Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) in introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal financial management by updating the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. The CFO Act created a new foundation for federal financial management and established a fiscal management reporting and leadership structure.Additionally, Grassley partnered with Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H ) to introduce bipartisan legislation to increase transparency and accountability within the federal government. The Oversight.gov Authorization Act would formally authorize the establishment and maintenance of a website to help the public more easily access reports that have been generated by the independent work of Inspectors General.Grassley, and Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) requested information about the federal government’s ability to timely respond to public records requests in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Justice Department’s Office of Information Policy (OIP), the senators, all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted reports of decreased capability to process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and other concerning developments, including the FBI’s decision to stop accepting electronic requests altogether. The senators also released the findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report titled “Freedom of Information Act: Federal Agencies’ Recent Implementation Efforts. ”Grassley continued his work to ensure Social Security remains strong for generations to come. Along with House Ways and Means Ranking Member Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Grassley wrote to the Chief Actuary of Social Security regarding the use of his office for political purposes and pushed for public clarifications to recently published analysis that has allowed for partisan misinformation to be spread by Democrats. As the leading Republican tax writers, Grassley and Brady argued that Social Security’s actuaries should not be used for political purposes. The Chief Actuary of Social Security promptly responded with a letter and affirmed that he was “not aware that anyone has proposed” legislation like Senate Democrats outlined in a recent request, which they subsequently used to spread false and misleading partisan messaging. Grassley took to the Senate floor to set the record straight and urged his Democratic colleagues to stop spreading misinformation to scare Social Security beneficiaries.In October, Grassley and Brady again reached out to request more information on how the Office of the Chief Actuary functions, particularly in responding to requests from outside groups, using taxpayer dollars. “Given the finite resources available and the important services the SSA provides to Americans, it is essential that the agency’s budget is used wisely. For that reason, we are seeking additional information regarding practices of the Office of the Chief Actuary for information, analysis, and/or technical assistance requested by non-government individuals and organizations,” the members wrote.In December, Grassley and Brady requested that the Chief Actuary of Social Security explain misleading testimony that the actuary presented before a congressional committee in July. In that testimony, the Chief Actuary appeared to have been attempting to provide justification for lack of prior action on an important issue in Social Security by Congress. As the letter from Grassley and Brady to the Chief Actuary identified: “It is not the job of anyone at the Social Security Administration to justify decisions made by Congress and we are concerned by your recent attempt to do so.Health Care:With the COVID-19 pandemic, families faced unique challenges accessing health care services. Recognizing this, Grassley introduced the bipartisan Accelerating Kids’ Access to Care Act to help families access life-saving care for children with complex medical conditions. The legislation aims to facilitate access to care while retaining program safeguards and reducing regulatory burdens on providers. This legislation builds off the Grassley-sponsored Advancing Care for Exceptional (ACE) Kids Act, which was signed into law in 2019, which makes it easier for the many providers who treat children with complex conditions to coordinate care and improve outcomes.In September, Grassley fought to include the Medicare Part B Premium Adjustment provision in the Senate appropriations bill. This will protect Medicare beneficiaries from an expected spike in the Part B premium for 2021 caused by economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grassley also authored a provision to address concerns with the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. This provision delays the date on which hospitals and other providers must start to repay Medicare Accelerated and Advance payment loans and makes other changes to relax repayment terms, while protecting the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund.The Senate voted by unanimous consent to pass the Emergency Aid for Returning Americans Affected by Coronavirus Act authored by Grassley and Wyden. This bill would ensure adequate funding be available to help Americans recently brought back to U.S because of COVID-19.Throughout the pandemic, Grassley worked with the Trump administration on a variety of health care policies. He praised the Administration’s reforms to the Medicaid program which will allow more flexibility for states while they continue to care for and protect individual Americans and communities at most risk.Grassley also followed up with the FDA this year to ensure Americans can access over-the-counter hearing aids without delay. Grassley’s Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, which was signed into law in 2017 to remove outdated regulations blocking consumer access to affordable hearing aids, required the FDA to issue these proposed regulations no later than August 18, 2020, but the FDA has yet to do so.Grassley partnered with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to introduce a bipartisan resolution designating the week of October 5 through October 9 2020, as “Malnutrition Awareness Week. ” The resolution recognizes the impact the pandemic has had on vulnerable populations and supports emergency funding for federal nutrition programs to combat malnutrition. Grassley also highlighted mental health awareness month and the services available to Iowans during this difficult time.Over the years, Congress has considered a number of initiatives aimed at addressing maternal health. Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden asked stakeholders to submit data and findings on factors contributing to poor maternal health outcomes in the United States. The Senate Finance Committee leaders also requested specific, evidence-based solutions to address those factors and improve maternal health. In addition, in June 2020, Grassley wrote a letter to every member of the Senate Finance Committee soliciting ideas for how to address racial and ethnic health disparities.Grassley also continued his oversight work into the nation’s organ donation and procurement system. In October, he sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This probe comes after numerous inspector general audits and news reports raised questions about the adequacy of patient safety standards, suggested thousands of available organs are not being used and highlighted questionable financial practices of some organ procurement organizations (OPOs). This letter is part of the ongoing investigation into the conduct of the nation’s organ procurement organizations, and the oversight gaps present in the U.S organ donation and procurement system. In February, Grassley and Wyden jointly initiated this bipartisan investigation with Senators Young and Cardin when they sent an expansive request for information and data to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which was contracted by Congress nearly four decades ago to oversee the U.S Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). This investigation is ongoing.In April 2019, Grassley and Wyden jointly began investigations of organizations in their home states that provide services to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). This December, they released two investigative reports regarding the performance and efficacy of providers REM Iowa and MENTOR Oregon, which receive significant federal funding through Medicaid to provide care for individuals with I/DD. Grassley’s review of REM Iowa found that the company has had and continues to face problems, including failures to report abuse or neglect, failures to follow an individual’s particular care plan and failures to adhere to clients’ medication schedules. Grassley’s report makes three specific recommendations to REM Iowa: improve training practices for employees, improve access to data and establish a process to track and monitor critical incidents using electronic databases. Grassley’s report also recommends that the federal and state governments improve oversight, outreach and support for facilities facing systemic issues.On December 2, 2020, Grassley wrote a letter to every member of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees about the need for new attention to the tax laws governing non-profit hospitals. In late 2019, Grassley announced he was renewing his probe of non-profit, tax-exempt hospitals. “It’s time for Americans to have more financial information available to them when going to the hospital and working with their insurance companies. It’s time for Congress to empower Americans to shop for healthcare in a competitive, functional market so as to reduce the costs of care and coverage, and save individuals and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars,” Grassley wrote.Housing:Grassley joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce legislation to protect property owners whose assets are seized by the federal government. An earlier version of the bill was introduced in 2016, following a Judiciary Committee hearing that examined several concerns associated with law enforcement asset seizure policies and practices. The hearing identified gaps in procedural protections for property owners whose assets were seized despite the absence of criminal charges or convictions. Additionally, many individuals whose assets are seized don’t know their rights and don’t know how to proceed to challenge the seizure.Illegal, illicit drugs, and opioids:In 2020, Grassley continued his longtime work addressing illegal and illicit drug manufacturing and addiction in the U.S He joined Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in introducing the Methamphetamine Response Act, a bill declaring methamphetamine an emerging drug threat which would require the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to develop, implement and make public a national plan to prevent methamphetamine addiction and overdoses from becoming a crisis. This bill passed the Senate on November 16, 2020 but wasn’t considered for final passage in the House of Representatives.Grassley also cosponsored the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. President Trump signed this bill into law in February, which extends a Drug Enforcement Administration temporary scheduling order to proactively control deadly fentanyl analogues. Fentanyl-related overdose deaths continue to rise and sophisticated drug trafficking organizations manipulate dangerous substances to skirt the law, so this critical law placed fentanyl substances in Schedule I so that they can be better detected and criminals can be held accountable for their actions. This Grassley supported law sunsets in May of 2021.He also joined Feinstein in authoring a resolution designating October as “National Substance Abuse Prevention Month,” to help raise awareness about substance use and misuse in the United States.Grassley and Ernst once again urged Iowans to participate in National Drug Take-Back Day. Unused, unneeded and expired prescription medicines present risk for misuse and theft. Responsible disposal can help prevent accidental poisoning, addiction and overdose deaths.As Chairman of the Senate Finance Finance Committee, Grassley initiated a bipartisan investigation with Ranking Member Ron Wyden, and sent letters to 10 tax-exempt organizations requesting information about their financial relationship with opioid manufacturers. This is a continuation of the investigation Grassley started in 2012, when he was Ranking Member of Judiciary. This investigation requested payment data, IRS Form 990s, and copies of comments and written materials that the tax-exempt organization sent to Federal task forces, committees, and other advisory groups from 2012 to the present. The purpose of this request was to discover whether these tax-exempt advocacy groups echoed or amplified the messages of pharmaceutical donors to sway public and Federal opinion about opioid prescribing practices. Grassley and Wyden expect to release the findings of their investigation before the end of the year.Immigration and Visas:Grassley has been a longtime supporter of the E-verify program and reintroduced the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act this Congress, which would permanently authorize and require employers to use the E-Verify program. E-Verify is an internet-based system that assists employers in determining the eligibility of employees to work in the United States.Grassley and a bipartisan group of Senators renewed calls for significant regulatory or legislative reforms to the H-2B visa program before increasing the annual visa cap. They raised concerns that the flawed non-agriculture guest worker visa program displaces American workers and can incentivize the exploitation of both foreign and American workers.Additionally, Grassley sent a letter to Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner Andrew Saul and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Chad Wolf seeking information on why SSA was not providing the statutorily required information to DHS regarding noncitizens working on and reporting wage earnings to non-work Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Grassley’s letter follows a concerning SSA Inspector General report that discussed the issue last year. The use of non-work SSNs to obtain employment and work illegally is not an insignificant problem. The OIG report stated that approximately 364,000 people with non-work SSNs reported billions of dollars in wages over a 3-year tax period from 2014-2016.Grassley joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to introduce legislation to reform and close loopholes in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act would prioritize American workers and restore fairness in visa programs for skilled foreign workers. The legislation reinstates Congress’ original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders. Grassley also praised the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security this year as they worked to address abuses in the high-skilled guest worker program that has been used to displace American workers with low-paid foreign labor.Grassley sought information on a number of cases in which a crime was carried out by someone who was in the United States illegally. Grassley and Ernst requested answers regarding a suspected al Qaeda leader wanted for murdering two Iraqi police officers who was able to receive refugee status in the United States and later become a U.S citizen. He also joined a group of Republican senators to investigate how a Mexican national illegally in the country was never removed despite having a history of violent and illegal behavior that culminated in the deaths of four law enforcement motorcycle club members. Ivan Robles Navejas is charged with causing a head-on collision with members of the Thin Blue Line Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club in July, killing four riders and injuring several others. He was allegedly intoxicated at the time of the collision, and had previously faced assault, drunk driving and resisting arrest charges dating back to 2013.In the past, Grassley has raised concerns about visa mills that masquerade as educational institutions but actually function as de facto employment agencies that help aliens fraudulently enter the United States under F-1 student visas. Grassley continued his oversight of F-1 visa fraud in 2020 by pressing DHS about the steps it is taking to crack down on fraudulent companies providing fake employment offers to foreign students seeking to extend their F-1 visas and remain in the U.S after graduation.Impeachment:At the beginning of the year, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced she would transmit articles of impeachment to the United States Senate. As president pro tempore of the Senate, Grassley presided over the opening of the impeachment trial of President Trump. Throughout the trial, Grassley fulfilled his duty to thoughtfully consider all the facts.Following the proceedings, he criticized the House’s flawed process and evolving arguments, and expressed the importance of respecting precedent. Removing a president for legal actions based on a flawed and partisan process, especially in the midst of an election year, would set a dangerous standard for future impeachments. He ultimately rejected the articles of impeachment on constitutional, legal and prudential grounds.Infrastructure:Grassley continued to address the increased need for rural broadband in 2020. Grassley has a long history of working to close the digital divide in Iowa. He is a strong advocate for rural broadband deployment and providing the tools necessary to make sure rural America is not left behind. Grassley supported the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act that requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue new rules to require the collection and dissemination of granular broadband availability data and to establish a process to verify the accuracy of such data. President Trump signed this bill into law in March. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 fully funds the Broadband DATA Act.He also highlighted the Federal Highway Administration’s proposed new rule to advance broadband technology in rural America. The proposed rule would help improve coordination and utilize construction projects for installation of broadband infrastructure.In 2019, Iowa faced devastating and historic flooding across the state. Grassley and Ernst held a hearing in Southwest Iowa that focused on the U.S Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) management of the Missouri River. They closely monitored the situation along the western border and sent a letter urging the USACE to provide additional funding for projects to improve safety and navigation on the lower Missouri River. Grassley praised the U.S Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) for helping fund critical projects to help with flood recovery, including the announcement awarding a $7.9 million grant to the city of Hamburg, Iowa, to make critical infrastructure improvements needed to protect businesses along the Missouri River from flooding. This EDA grant, to be matched with $1.9 million in local investment, is expected to create or retain 349 jobs.Grassley also joined Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to introduce new legislation to overhaul the USACE process for managing water resource projects along the lower Missouri River system. The Lower Missouri River Flood Prevention Program Act would require the USACE to implement a new system-wide approach to water development projects to reduce flood risk and improve flood protection along the lower Missouri River.On the other side of the state, Grassley praised the Corps’ decision to approve three Port Statistical Areas (PSAs) on the Mississippi River. This federal recognition as a multi-modal port region will be leveraged by local governments and businesses for marketing and economic development that will improve regional, national and global competitiveness.Grassley praised the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (WRDA) which was included in the year-end funding bill. WRDA addresses the civil works program of the Army Corps of Engineers. Grassley advocated for a number of provisions that were incorporated in the final bill including the Inland Waterway Trust Fund Cost Share Program. This provision modifies the cost share for construction or major rehabilitation of a project on the inland waterways to 65 percent from the general fund of the Treasury and 35 percent from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund.Grassley also worked to include a provision that would make temporary flood control structures permanent. This provision creates a new authority for the Corps to review whether temporary flood control structures it has constructed should be made permanent, and allows the local cost-share for making them permanent to be waived for communities that are small, financially disadvantaged or at risk of recurring flooding.Additionally, Grassley was vocal to include a provision to update the Des Moines Birdland Levee. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorized the Des Moines and Raccoon River project which was completed in 2012. However, due to design deficiencies by the Corps, approximately 1.7 miles of this levee does not meet the Corps’ design criteria for under-seepage. This additional authorized funding will bring the deficient portion of the levee up to Corps standards.The final bill also contains important provisions for Iowans including expanding work on a Lower Missouri River Basin Flood Risk Resiliency Plan, expedited completion of maintenance and repair activities for federally operated and maintained levees systems in the Lower Missouri River basin, expedited processing of permits and approvals of repairs of flood control infrastructure caused by flood in 2019, changes to the PL 84-99 non-federal levee program to enhance flood protections, further prohibitions of Interception-Rearing Complex’s (IRc’s), continuation of work on the Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan along with several other provisions critical to flood control and navigation.Grassley partnered with Ernst and went to bat for Iowa Minor League Baseball this year. They joined a bipartisan resolution and urged support for preserving Minor League Baseball clubs across the country, including those in Davenport, Burlington and Clinton, in response to Major League Baseball’s (MLB) proposal to eliminate 42 teams nationwide. The Des Moines Iowa Cubs, Cedar Rapids Kernels, and the Quad Cities River Bandits are all retaining affiliation with MLB teams in the region. The Clinton LumberKings and Burlington Bees will have opportunities to join other leagues.Law Enforcement:To honor the service and sacrifice made by the men and women in law enforcement, Grassley supported a resolution designating the week of May 11 through May 17, 2020, as 'National Police Week.'During Police Week, a bipartisan package of law enforcement bills championed by Grassley sailed through the Senate, including the Confidentiality Opportunities for Peer Support (COPS) Counseling Act. Senator Grassley is the lead Republican on this bill, which provides mental health support to law enforcement by encouraging the adoption of peer counselling programs, while protecting the privacy of federal officers who participate.The Judiciary Committee also advanced the Grassley supported Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act, which requires the FBI to collect voluntarily submitted, anonymous data on police suicides and attempted suicides from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Collecting this data will help inform policy solutions to promote prevention of law enforcement suicides.Grassley also supported legislation to help the nation’s first responders. Without skipping a beat, first responders adapted to the ever-changing demands of the pandemic. Grassley and a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation to ensure families of public safety officers lost to COVID-19 can quickly access survivor benefits. The Safeguarding America’s First Responders Act (SAFR) clarifies the certification requirements for survivor benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program to account for the unique challenges presented by the pandemic. In August, President Trump signed this bill into law.These three bills - along with the resolution commemorating National Police Week - won unanimous approval in the Senate.This year, many Americans called for Congress to enact police reforms. Grassley supported Sen. Tim Scott’s (R-S.C ) proposal. The JUSTICE Act included bipartisan provisions to improve accountability and transparency in policing. It also designated lynching as a federal hate crime and penalized states for allowing police to use chokeholds. However, this legislation did not move forward on the Senate floor because Senate Democrats refused to even debate the legislation or work with Scott or other senators on police reform legislation.National Security:This year, President Trump made a historic breakthrough for peace in the Middle East with the signing of the Abraham Accords. This is the first tangible progress in a quarter century. Grassley met Anwar Sadat at the time of the Camp David Accords in 1978 and witnessed the handshake between Rabin and Arafat in 1993.An Iowan, Mr. Christopher Miller, was nominated to be Director of the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Grassley had the honor to introduce him at his confirmation hearing. Christopher Miller is currently serving as the Acting Secretary of Defense.Grassley joined 42 Senate colleagues in supporting a resolution honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who carried out the successful mission that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and a designated terrorist.Grassley also joined his Senate colleagues in commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the bombings of the U.S Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998. The senators called on the Trump administration and Congress “to deliver justice to the victims and their families and appropriately and equitably address terrorism-related claims against Sudan. ”On June 5, 2020, Grassley chaired a hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research titled, “Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-Funded Research: Oversight Opportunities and Policy Solutions. ” That same day, Grassley held a classified member-level briefing on the same subject. Grassley is a leading voice in the effort to protect the integrity of taxpayer-funded research. In addition to his inquiries to DoD, Grassley also pressed the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Health and Human Services Inspector General, Justice Department, and Government Accountability Office on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research.Presidential Nominations:As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley carried out the Senate’s constitutionally mandated “advice and consent” responsibilities respecting presidential nominations to many key departments and agencies. During the 116th Congress, the Finance Committee reported 21 individual nominations to the full Senate and 19 of those have been confirmed, including: Andrew M. Saul to be Commissioner of Social Security, Brent James McIntosh to be an Under Secretary of the Treasury, and Michael J. Desmond to be Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service.Reform to Victims’ Rights Laws:Grassley continued to stand up for victims of human trafficking. Grassley joined his colleagues in supporting a resolution observing National Trafficking, Modern Slavery Prevention Month. He was also a recipient of the 2020 Outstanding Anti-Human Trafficking Service Award from Gov. Reynolds.In 2020, Grassley continued his work to prevent abuse of young athletes. He introduced legislation, the Stopping Abuse From Entering Sports, Promoting Oversight, Responsibility And Transparency (SAFESPORT) Act. It builds on an earlier measure Grassley cosponsored and shepherded through the Judiciary Committee in 2018, during his tenure as that committee’s chairman. His latest proposal includes funding accountability measures, anti-retaliation protections, child abuse reporting requirements, and other reforms. The Senate passed this landmark legislation in August.Grassley also joined his colleagues in introducing several bipartisan Senate resolutions to support victims of sexual and domestic violence. One expresses support for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month and another honors those who have worked to help crime victims during the pandemic. These measures passed the Senate by unanimous consent.Grassley also joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in introducing the Improving Social Security’s Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act to provide more efficient help to Americans whose social security numbers have been stolen and misused.Grassley praised the U.S House of Representatives broad bipartisan approval of anti-lynching legislation this year. The bill is similar to bipartisan legislation Grassley led through the Judiciary Committee in 2018, and which passed unanimously in the Senate last year.Religious Freedoms:The Declaration of Independence recognizes each individual is endowed with unalienable rights. However, countries around the world still have blasphemy laws with religious persecution still taking place. In October 2018, Grassley sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing concerns about the ongoing religious persecution of religious minorities by the communist regime in China. The State Department placed visa restrictions last fall on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention or abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs or other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China. Grassley has continued to monitor this situation and hold world organizations accountable for their complicit support of China.Second Amendment:Grassley and his colleagues encouraged the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to continue protecting public safety while respecting the Second Amendment and federal law during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.They wrote, “As our country continues to respond to the pandemic, we are seeking additional information on the impact the coronavirus has had on your agencies and the firearm transfer process so that we have a clearer picture on where things stand and how we can better assist through the legislative and appropriations process. ”Grassley also joined a letter with Senator Braun and other colleagues to Attorney General Barr and ATF Acting Director Lombardo to share their concern about the ATF practice of relying on non-public standards in its regulation of the importation of pistol stabilizing braces. The letter requests that ATF clearly articulate its position on the regulation of pistol braces, as a “know it when you see it” approach to firearms by the ATF can quickly become a slippery slope for all legal American gun owners as well as government firearm regulation enforcement.Taxes:Grassley was instrumental in the crafting and passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Trump. Throughout 2020, taxpayers across the country saw the benefits of these important tax reforms.After assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee in January, 2019, Grassley worked closely with the Treasury Department as it issued regulations and other guidance related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provided clarity to families, farmers, cooperatives, and businesses – small to large – on changes to the business tax rules including the 20-percent deduction for pass-through businesses, the opportunity zones initiative, and international tax laws.Following this work, Grassley raised concerns about Joe Biden’s tax proposals. Biden vowed to raise taxes immediately on U.S businesses, undo the 2017 tax law and impose trillions of dollars in tax hikes on individuals and businesses.As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley convened a hearing on the 2020 tax filing season and the IRS’ handling of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Throughout this hearing, Grassley questioned how the IRS was managing its standard responsibilities during the pandemic while also implementing a number of tax measures enacted by Congress to provide relief to individuals and businesses.During this legislative session, Grassley continued to advocate for retirement savings reform. He authored the Retirement Enhancement and Savings (RESA) Act of 2019, which formed the basis of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019 that was included in the 2019 year-end appropriations package. This legislation will help more Americans save for their retirement and allow more American businesses to invest in their employees’ future financial security by improving access to retirement savings plans through the creation of multiple employer plan retirement programs.Grassley also joined Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) who chairs the Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee, in releasing a comprehensive reform package to address the financial crisis in the multiemployer pension plan system. The Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and Reform Plan would provide targeted financial assistance to a number of large severely underfunded multiemployer plans and reform the overall system to protect workers and retirees from financial hardships resulting from the failure of their multiemployer pension plan. Since the release of the plan, Grassley has pursued bipartisan discussions to develop a consensus agreement to reform the multiemployer system for the long-term.In August, Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden concluded their investigation into syndicated conservation-easement transactions and released a report on that investigation. The report found those transactions “to be nothing more than retail tax shelters that let taxpayers buy tax deductions at the end of any given year, ... which thousands of taxpayers used to game the tax code and deprive the federal government of billions of dollars in revenue. ” It concluded that “the IRS has strong reason for taking enforcement action against syndicated conservation-easement transactions as it has to date” and called on Congress, the IRS, and the Department of the Treasury to take further action to preserve the integrity of the conservation-easement tax deduction.To that end, Grassley joined Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) in reintroducing the Charitable Conservation Easement Program Integrity Act, which would protect conservation easements from abuse, save taxpayers billions of dollars and promote conservation around the country.Grassley also continued to advocate for clean energy tax policies in Congress. In January, he joined his colleagues in sending a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig requesting information to better understand how the IRS enforces the electric vehicle tax credit in light of a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration audit report that detailed what appear to be systemic problems with the tax-credit program. And in February, he called out Senate Democrats’ on their misleading and baseless letter regarding energy tax policies that ignore recent and longer-term history on how to successfully enact bipartisan green energy policies.Grassley worked with Wyden to support the Treasury Department’s participation in the multilateral process at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is intended to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. In letters and other communications throughout this legislative session, Grassley and Wyden expressed their strong bipartisan opposition to unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs) that target and discriminate against U.S -based companies operating around the world. Earlier this year, Grassley and Wyden supported an agreement between the United States and France postponing the imposition of the French digital services tax in favor of reaching a multilateral agreement at the OECD. Grassley and Wyden also opposed a U.K digital service tax that took effect in July. With additional DSTs being introduced or considered by U.S trading partners, Grassley and Wyden voiced support for USTR’s investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act of foreign DSTs. Grassley and Wyden also supported USTR’s decision to impose additional tariffs on French goods after a 180-day deferral period.Trade:The state of trade policy took center stage in 2020. Grassley was a central figure in the debate, advocating vigorously on behalf of Iowa’s interests.In the last three years, Grassley provided extensive support to the President’s efforts to renegotiate NAFTA. The updated trade pact reached by the President is called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) – and provides a host of new benefits for America’s farmers, workers, and manufacturers. The nonpartisan International Trade Commission estimates that USMCA will add more than $68 billion to U.S gross domestic product and generate 176,000 jobs.As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley worked closely with committee members and the Administration to guide USMCA through Congress. Democrats in the House of Representatives unreasonably delayed passage of USMCA last year. However, in January, USMCA finally passed with broad bipartisan support.As part of ensuring that USMCA was passed, Grassley made clear the Administration’s national security steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico would have to be dropped – as would those countries’ retaliatory tariffs on U.S agricultural products. All sides’ tariffs came down – and Iowa’s farmers regained access to two of their most important markets.As President pro tempore of the Senate, Grassley led an enrollment ceremony to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act. Grassley’s signing of the legislation was the final step before it went to the president for his signature to become law. Grassley then attended the USMCA signing ceremony at the White House.Grassley has long recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) can be a powerful tool to remove foreign trade barriers. However, the WTO needs significant reform – particularly in light of its failure to address China’s abusive trade practices. Grassley held a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the road ahead for the WTO.Grassley also supported the President in confronting China on its abusive trade practices. Grassley welcomed the Phase 1 deal the President reached with China. Iowans, especially hog, corn and soybean farmers, will benefit from provisions in the deal that remove trade barriers, and commit China to increasing purchases of agricultural products. Grassley also attended the Phase 1 deal signing ceremony at the White House.The U.S continued to expand its market this year with ethanol in Brazil. Grassley praised the new agreement which will allow 198 million gallons of ethanol into the country duty-free with imported gallons beyond that subject to the 20 percent tariff. Brazil was the largest U.S ethanol export market last year, purchasing 332 million gallons of U.S -produced ethanol worth $493 million.To address the disruptions and deficient supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Grassley and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) called for an expedited investigation to identify the products that may be needed to respond to the pandemic. The lawmakers requested the Commission produce a report by April 30 detailing the tariff classifications and applicable rates of duty associated with the products to assist the Committees in their work to combat the coronavirus emergency. Following the initial report, Grassley and his colleagues again wrote to the Commission to conduct a follow-on investigation and prepare a report as there were persistent challenges in meeting supply for these critical products.Over the summer, Grassley held a series of hearings titled, “Protecting the Reliability of the U.S Medical Supply Chain During the COVID-19 Pandemic. ” Grassley highlighted the pandemic brings greater urgency to efforts to build resiliencies into our essential supply chains required to avoid shortages and protect American lives.Veterans:In 2020, Grassley continued hosting Iowa veterans to participate in the Library of Congress’s Veterans History Project. Established by Congress in 2000, the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress collects, preserves and makes accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. To date, more than 1,200 stories from Iowans have been recorded for the project. In November of 2018, Grassley’s office interviewed Iowa veterans at the Iowa Gold Star Museum at Camp Dodge in Des Moines to document their service to the nation. In May, he delivered 20 veterans’ recorded interviews and documents. In November of 2019, Grassley’s office interviewed Iowa veterans at Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown. In December, he delivered 11 veterans’ recorded interviews and documents. This year, Grassley’s staff interviewed Iowa veterans at the Waverly Area Veterans Post.The Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act, authored by Sen. Ernst and cosponsored by Sens. Grassley, John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) unanimously passed the Senate in July. This bill requires that every health care provider hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with a revoked license must undergo a third party review of that provider’s care. If the review determines that a competent practitioner would have managed the veteran’s care differently, the veteran will be notified.The U.S Secretary of Interior announced at the Iowa Gold Star Military Museum in Johnston that starting on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2020, all U.S veterans and Gold Star families will be given free entry into national parks, federal lands and wildlife refuges managed by the U.S Department of Interior. This new, lifetime benefit provides free admission for millions of veterans and their families. Grassley praised this announcement and honored all the nation’s veterans for their dedication and sacrifice.Additionally, Grassley urged his colleagues to join him in his decades-long effort to establish a memorial on the National Mall to those Black Revolutionary War patriots who fought for the founding of our country.Whistleblowers:As a staunch proponent of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government and as a founding member of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, Grassley has long championed the cause of whistleblowers.In March, Grassley introduced an amendment to the American Energy Innovation Act. This amendment addresses a critical shortcoming with the whistleblower protections currently available to the power sector employees responsible for maintaining and securing our nation’s electric grid. It also makes it clear that power sector employees who report threats to our electric grid are protected from retaliation.Grassley also introduced the CFTC Fund Management Act. This legislation includes important updates to the Commodity Future Trading Commission’s highly successful whistleblower program, including an increase to the statutory cap for the fund used to pay whistleblower awards and new audit requirements designed to increase transparency.The federal government recovered more than $3 billion in taxpayer dollars lost to fraud in 2019, using a law championed by Grassley. Whistleblower claims account for more than two-thirds of those recoveries. Since its enactment in 1986, the False Claims Act is responsible for more than $62 billion in recoveries, with Grassley’s whistleblower provision saving taxpayers more than $44.7 billion.To honor the critical role played by whistleblowers in promoting good governance, Grassley introduced a resolution designating July 30, 2020, as 'National Whistleblower Appreciation Day.' It passed the Senate by unanimous consent.This year, our country faced down a worldwide pandemic that produced a prolonged economic crisis. Although these are clearly divisive times, Grassley continued his work as one of the most bipartisan legislators in the Senate, working with his colleagues across the aisle to find solutions to the pressing problems we faced in 2020. Grassley looks forward to continuing that work in 2021, when he will once again assume Republican leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee even as he continues his important work on behalf of Iowans on the Finance, Budget, and Agriculture Committees."

Chuck Grassley (R-IA) News Release",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today marked a series of policy and oversight accomplishments of 2020.
""While this past year has been challenging for us all, serving the people of Iowa is my first priority and it's an honor that I take seriously. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and through my extensive oversight efforts, my work focuses on making the government more transparent, efficient and accountable to Iowans and all Americans,"" Grassley said.
Grassley holds at least one question-and-answer session in each of Iowa's 99 counties every year to hear concerns and answer questions on any subject from Iowans. In 2020, Grassley completed his annual county meetings for the 40th year in a row. Grassley holds meetings in a variety of settings to ensure that a broad cross-section of Iowans can participate, including businesses, schools, town hall meetings, hospitals and factory floors. While the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some of Grassley's meetings look a little different this year, the format remained the same: Iowans set the agenda. Grassley moved forward with his meetings in a safe and responsible way while following public health guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the state of Iowa.
In addition to his annual meetings, Grassley attended or convened a variety of events and forums, including:
* Agriculture Discussion with State and Federal Leaders
* Veterans History Project
* Survey of Derecho Damage
In 2020, Grassley continued his annual social media series called #CornWatch and #SoybeanWatch. These give followers an inside look at farming operations and to track the progression of corn and soybean crops grown on the Grassley family farm in New Hartford, Iowa, from planting through harvest.
When the Senate is in session, Grassley sets aside at least eight 15-minute meetings every Monday through Thursday to meet with Iowans in Washington, D.C., including advocacy groups, associations, chambers of commerce and local business leaders, students and families. While there were limitations this year due to the pandemic, Grassley was able to meet with Iowans virtually. Throughout 2020, Grassley met with more than 800 groups of Iowans and discussed a variety of policy issues such as trade, tax reform, prescription drug pricing as well as the many issues that have arisen during the pandemic. Grassley also joined Iowa schools for QandAs via video conferencing and, as an avid fan of Iowa universities, cheered on dozens of student-athletes at sporting events.
This year, Grassley became the 10th longest-serving U.S. Senator in history and continued his constitutional duty serving as the Senate president pro tempore, a position historically bestowed upon the most senior member of the majority party in the upper chamber of Congress. Upon his swearing in, Grassley became third in the line of presidential succession following the vice president and the speaker of the House of Representatives. An Iowan has not held this position since Senator Albert B. Cummins in 1919. In his capacity as president pro tempore, Grassley aided in the selection process of the new Architect of the Capitol and nominated an Iowan to the U.S. Senate Curatorial Advisory board. He also played a role in many historic events this year including welcoming President Donald Trump into the chamber of the House of Representatives for the 68th annual State of the Union address and signing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
Highlights of Grassley's legislative and oversight work follow here:
Agriculture:
This year was particularly tough on the farming industry due to commodity prices taking a hit from the novel coronavirus, drought across West Central Iowa and an intense windstorm known as a derecho that caused widespread damage across central Iowa. However, through it all, farmers continued to plow ahead and support their communities. As the senior senator of one of the top agricultural states in the country and a family farmer, Grassley has been an outspoken advocate for farmers and Rural America.
Throughout the various spending negotiations in Congress, Grassley was a staunch defender of family farms. He led the Iowa Congressional delegation in urging Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to ensure funds for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) were replenished in the next government funding bill. He exposed Democrats for blocking crucial coronavirus relief, which included billions of dollars in assistance for farmers and agribusiness employees.
When COVID-19 began affecting our meat supply chain, Grassley immediately raised concerns with his colleagues. Grassley has long focused on consolidation in the meatpacking industry and pressed USDA to protect independent producers. In May, Grassley introduced bipartisan legislation that would foster efficient markets and improve competition and transparency among packers that purchase cattle. Grassley first introduced this bill in 2002. The bill will require a minimum of 50 percent of a packer's weekly volume of beef slaughter to come as a result of purchases made on the open or spot market.
While many around the country noticed higher prices at the grocery store due to these market disruptions, many cattle producers across the country could not get a bid on their animals. Grassley was one of the first lawmakers to seek an investigation to bring more transparency to the cattle industry. He called on the Departments of Justice and Agriculture to investigate potential market manipulation and other illegal activity by large meat packing companies in the cattle industry. President Trump echoed this call for an investigation into possible anticompetitive behavior in the beef industry.
In June, Grassley sent a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue relaying the frustration of farmers about the lack of enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act, and called for the report on the Holcomb, Kansas, fire to be released by August 9, 2020, or he would seek an audit of the USDA's enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Division. USDA took this issue seriously and released its report echoing the need for more transparency in the industry. Additionally, he partnered with Sen. Tester in sending a letter to Secretary Perdue recommending the department clarify an ambiguous proposed rule regarding the undue and reasonable preferences provision of the Packers and Stockyards Act.
This year, Grassley also joined Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Securing All Livestock Equitably (SALE) Act. Quick turnaround between the purchase and resale of cattle by a dealer often leaves the rancher who originally owned the cattle with little recourse if a dealer defaults on a purchase because the livestock has often already been resold. The SALE Act would establish dealer statutory trusts, mimicking existing packer statutory trusts, for the purpose of ensuring that cattle sellers receive payment should a livestock dealer become insolvent.
Pork producers around the country faced significant challenges this year due to pork processing plant closures. Grassley joined his colleagues Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) in introducing the Responding to Epidemic Losses and Investing in the Economic Future (RELIEF) for Producers Act of 2020, legislation that would provide relief to livestock and poultry producers amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
Grassley joined 30 members of Congress on a bipartisan, bicameral letter urging USDA Secretary Perdue to take immediate action to assist pork producers and maintain the pork food supply chain. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, Grassley led his colleagues in sending an additional letter to USDA to recommend additional funding for farmers being forced to depopulate their livestock herds. Farmers faced an animal welfare crisis due to overcrowding and the challenge of providing enough feed and water available to each animal. Grassley also joined Iowa leaders, Sen. Joni Ernst, Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig in sending a letter to Vice President Mike Pence and requested additional support from the Administration for the state's pork producers.
In addition to livestock farmers, Grassley urged his colleagues to support dairy farmers around the country. Additionally, he joined Sen. Ernst, Gov. Reynolds, and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Naig in requesting the USDA to include egg producers and turkey producers in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). In the second round of CFAP payments, both egg and turkey producers were eligible.
To make sure tax dollars are spent as intended to benefit the farmers who actually work the land instead of managers or corporations, Grassley has been a longtime advocate for farm payment limitations. This year, USDA initially announced a final rule on the implementation of payment limitations and the definition of ""actively engaged"" in farming as part of the 2018 Farm Bill, which would have required additional family members to provide either 25 percent of the total management hours required by the operation on an annual basis or perform at least 500 hours of management annually. Unfortunately, USDA recently reversed this rule. Prior to this reversal, Grassley requested an additional GAO review of the program. The GAO report concluded that while USDA has improved its completion of eligibility compliance review, additional oversight is needed. Grassley will continue his fight to close loopholes that have allowed some operations to exploit federal farm payments at taxpayer expense.
Grassley joined the only other farmer in the U.S. Senate, Jon Tester (D-Montana), to address farmer mental health. Grassley and Tester authored the Seeding Rural Resilience Act which aims to curb growing rates of suicide in Rural America by implementing a voluntary stress management training program, creating a public service announcement campaign to raise awareness and directing the Secretary of Agriculture to work with state and local groups to identify best practices when responding to farm mental stress. This bill was successfully voted out of the Senate this summer and later became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.
Diseases like African swine fever have the potential to devastate entire sectors of U.S. agriculture. With that in mind, Grassley cosponsored the Protecting America's Food and Agriculture Act of 2019 to address the shortage of agricultural inspectors who protect the nation's food supply and agricultural industries at the border. This legislation was signed into law by President Trump earlier this year.
This year, the Trump administration kept its promise and successfully rolled back the harmful Obama-era ""Waters of the United States"" or ""WOTUS"" rule and replaced it with a workable rule that clearly defines what waters fall under federal jurisdiction. Grassley was a steadfast opponent of the original rule, which would have regulated 97 percent of Iowa farmland as a navigable waterway. This regulatory certainty will continue to help spur economic growth in Iowa and around the country while also ensuring individual property rights are protected.
Enhancing water quality is critical to meeting the goals of Iowa's Nutrient Reduction Strategy and making improvements to Iowa's river and stream health. With that in mind, Grassley joined Sen. Ernst and a bipartisan group of senators to urge the USDA to make several changes to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to maximize the program's ability for producers to use the program to enhance both soil health and water quality.
Grassley also celebrated Thanksgiving this year by praising an Iowa family whose turkeys were chosen for the National Thanksgiving Turkey Pardoning Ceremony at the White House.
Antitrust:
Grassley joined Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to introduce the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules (SMARTER) Act. This bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to go through the same procedures that the Department of Justice (DOJ) must go through when enforcing antitrust law, and would require the Federal Communications Commission to issue merger review decisions expeditiously.
Grassley also partnered with Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) in introducing the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act which extends whistleblower protections for employees who provide information to DOJ related to criminal antitrust violations. The Senate unanimously passed a similar version of the legislation in 2013, 2015 and 2017. This year, the legislation passed in both the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Trump in December.
COVID-19:
In February, when the world was just learning about COVID-19, oversight and investigations staff for Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), received a classified briefing from the HHS Office of National Security (ONS) regarding the coronavirus threat and the status of U.S. government efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus.
In the early stages of the pandemic, Grassley urged further information sharing between federal health and intelligence agencies to strengthen the governmental response to the COVID-19 public health crisis and future health concerns. In April, he also joined colleagues in urging the executive branch to make relief assistance to long-term care facilities a top priority.
Grassley also was named to the bipartisan task force focused on safely re-opening America following the public health crisis. The task force includes Democrat and Republican members of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
Grassley was an original proponent of an emergency supplemental appropriations bill providing funding to combat the spread of COVID-19. The funding package amounts to an $8.3 billion surge in resources to combat COVID-19 and provides comprehensive funding for efforts on the local, state, national and international levels.
In March, Governor Reynolds declared a State of Public Health Emergency as confirmed COVID-19 cases rose. Grassley sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking that he promptly grant the Governor's request for an expedited review of the major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa as a result of multiple cases of COVID-19 detected in the state.
As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Grassley authored several provisions that would eventually be included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This bill passed out of the Senate 96-0 and provided direct economic relief to American families, workers, employers and health care providers coping with the coronavirus pandemic.
Along with direct payments to individuals and families, the CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance benefit benefits for jobless workers, and lending programs for businesses of all sizes. The bipartisan package developed targeted, temporary tax relief to help businesses and hospitals continue operations. One-size-fits-all is not the way the U.S. economy operates, and yet nearly every sector is bearing the burden of social distancing and stay-at-home orders across the country.
Small businesses across the country were hit particularly hard by associated COVID-19 restrictions. To address this, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act to help keep workers on the payroll by providing small businesses forgivable loans to cover payroll expenses. As the pandemic worsened, Grassley worked with his colleagues to provide additional funding to this program. While the Senate Democrats originally tried to block it, the additional funding later successfully went through. Grassley also worked with the Department of Treasury and the Small Business Administration on clarifying terms and eligibility of the program for Iowa businesses and bankers.
For example, Grassley partnered with Finance Committee Ranking Member, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) urging the Department of Treasury to allow small businesses to deduct expenses associated with PPP loans that are ultimately forgiven. Ultimately, Grassley and many of his colleagues disagreed with Treasury's final guidance.
Grassley worked with his colleagues to ensure the rural economy reaped the benefits of the CARES Act including additional funding for rural health centers, providers, programs, telehealth services and related infrastructure. Grassley also worked to secure relief for American agriculture. He worked to include $23.5 billion in the CARES Act to send emergency temporary relief to farm country to help survive the fall-out caused by the pandemic. Specifically, it set aside $9.5 billion for the USDA to directly support farmers and ranchers. The CARES Act also replenishes the Commodity Credit Corporation with $14 billion. Grassley called upon USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to use some of these additional funds to help support the biofuels industry, including resources for higher blends infrastructure at filling stations and to leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to buy excess farm commodities and replenish food pantries and nutrition programs across the nation. He then introduced legislation with Sen. Amy Klobuchar to make this a requirement.
Overall, the CARES Act provided much-needed relief to help Americans, including workers, seniors and student borrowers.
On December 21, the Senate passed an additional large legislative package including COVID-19 relief and economic stimulus, tax and health care policy extensions and government funding. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley championed several provisions including expanding unemployment insurance benefits, additional economic impact payments for individuals and families and extension of certain expiring provisions for families as well as small- and medium-sized businesses around the country. Additionally, under the Senate Finance Committee's jurisdiction, this package extends a number of important Medicare, Medicaid and other health policies, including boosting payments to doctors in Iowa and other rural areas. It also provides permanent coverage for mental health telehealth visits, which are helpful during the pandemic and will remain critical for many Americans afterward. And, it extends the period over which state and local governments can use money from the Coronavirus Relief Fund provided under the CARES Act by one year, giving more flexibility to state and local governments as they face spending challenges caused by the pandemic. It also provides additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Grassley's full statement on the legislative package and further details on what is included can be found HERE https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-statement-year-end-funding-and-pandemic-relief-legislation.
Grassley joined Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) to introduce the bipartisan State and Local Coronavirus Relief Fund Extension Act to extend the year-end deadline for states to use federal CARES Act assistance, as well as any future funding to state and local governments, through 2021. The goal of this bill is to provide flexibility in uses of Coronavirus Relief Fund resources by allowing spending by states, localities, territories, and tribes on coronavirus responses to be covered over a longer period of time.
Following implementation of the CARES Act, Grassley worked with his colleagues to craft an additional targeted relief package known as the HEALS Act. Unfortunately, both Senate and House Democrats refused to move forward with this legislation. Senate Democrats voted twice to block the legislation in the Senate. The HEALS Act would have provided relief measures supported on a bipartisan basis, such as providing additional funds for unemployment benefits, the Paycheck Protection Program, education, voting, state and local governments, recovery checks, and hiring and employee retention incentives.
Throughout the funding negotiations, Grassley worked to ensure the COVID-19 relief funds would go to those who actually needed it. With that in mind, Grassley introduced the COVID-19 Funding Accountability Act. This legislation would impose strict congressional oversight over the implementation of various funding in the CARES Act as well as create bipartisan oversight boards.
Grassley criticized his Democratic colleagues when they wanted to impose a quarter of a trillion dollar retroactive tax increase on businesses in need of cash to restart their operations as states began to lift shut-down orders.
Grassley also worked with Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) in introducing a bill to protect recovery payments provided in the recent CARES Act pandemic response legislation from garnishment by private debt collectors.
Grassley has been a longtime watchdog of waste, fraud and abuse. Unfortunately, throughout this pandemic, fraudsters have taken advantage of the American public through a variety of scams. Grassley wrote to the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) encouraging the IRS watchdog to engage in a public awareness and education campaign informing Americans of scams and frauds related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's response.
Grassley also partnered with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to call on DOJ to take vigorous action to protect consumers from price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic and help prevent the hoarding of essential medical supplies.
As COVID-19 affected areas of the country in different ways and at different times, Grassley applauded Gov. Reynolds' work to combat the virus. As hardship hit more Iowans and events were canceled, he urged Iowans to stay at home and do their part to slow the spread.
Although Grassley took all of the appropriate and recommended precautions, the senator tested positive for COVID-19 after learning of an earlier exposure. Grassley quarantined per CDC and local public health guidelines and at the recommendation of his doctors. Due to his quarantine, Grassley was unable to cast votes on the Senate floor for the first time in 27 years. Grassley has cast 8,927 consecutive votes and continues to hold the record for longest length of time without missing a vote in the history of the Senate. Ultimately, Grassley was asymptomatic throughout his quarantine and was cleared to return to work by his doctors.
Crime and Criminal Justice:
All Americans have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including inmates in the state and federal prison system. Grassley and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the lead authors of the bipartisan First Step Act (FSA), led 12 of their colleagues in a bipartisan letter pressing DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to take necessary steps to protect the health and wellbeing of federal prison staff and inmates in Federal custody. They urged the release or transfer of the most vulnerable inmates to home confinement as permitted under the FSA. The senators called on BOP and DOJ to review and expedite current cases where the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program would allow for an early transfer - where appropriate - of terminally ill and eligible elderly inmates to home confinement. In April, Grassley and Durbin sent a follow up letter to the DOJ Inspector General's (IG) regarding its decision to assess whether facilities housing BOP inmates are complying with available guidance and best practices regarding preventing, managing, and containing potential COVID-19 outbreaks and asked them to expand the probe.
As a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley also participated in a hearing titled, ""Examining Best Practices for Incarceration and Detention During COVID-19,"" where he pressed DOJ and BOP officials on the use of home confinement and adherence to CDC guidelines on social distancing, use of personal protective equipment, and other risk mitigation efforts in correctional facilities.
Also, in an effort to protect the most vulnerable inmates in our society, Grassley and Durbin introduced the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act. This bill expands eligibility for and provides judicial review of the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program, and also provides for the compassionate release of federal prisoners based on COVID-19 vulnerability and shortens the waiting period of judicial review during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Senator Grassley also led a letter to the Justice Department about its handling of COVID-19 in juvenile detention facilities. Along with Sens. Whitehouse and Ernst, Grassley urged the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to equip the juvenile justice system with consistent, reliable, and transparent information to help mitigate the impact of the virus on vulnerable youth.
Grassley continued his work to protect children from predators online through his co-sponsorship of the EARN IT Act. This bill creates incentives for the tech industry to address online child sexual exploitation, by removing blanket immunity in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. It also establishes a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention that will be responsible for developing voluntary best practices.
Lastly, Grassley reintroduced the Deterring Undue Enforcement by Protecting Rights of Citizens from Excessive Searches and Seizures Act of 2020, or the DUE PROCESS Act. This bipartisan bill seeks to protect property owners whose assets are seized by the federal government by increasing transparency and accountability in asset forfeiture proceedings.
Defense Oversight:
Grassley's extensive oversight work throughout his career has included a dogged pursuit for answers from the Pentagon over decades of wasteful spending and its inability to produce a clean financial audit.
Grassley has conducted oversight to hold the DoD accountable for over four decades. He continued to press the Department on the new Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program, alleged conflicts of interest pertaining to those charged with creating its bid and reported disputes between bidders and the Department. This comes after the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed a review and provided recommendations in response to Grassley and members of Congress raising concerns about the JEDI program. Last year, Grassley sent a letter to then Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, seeking information on Department policies intended to mitigate conflicts of interest and prevent the tailoring of procurement requests to match a specific vendor, as alleged in the JEDI program procurement process.
Grassley and several of his colleagues sent a letter to GAO in July 2018 requesting the agency conduct an independent review of the reasons behind the DoD's failure to acquire modern financial information technology systems capable of generating reliable information and supporting credible financial statements. The report was released in September and reaffirmed Grassley's longtime concerns about financial mismanagement and waste at the DoD. The Department is working towards a clean audit and updating its financial management systems. However, it's clear from this report the Pentagon has a long way to go.
Grassley, along with the other requestors of the GAO report and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), also sent a letter earlier this year to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, urging them to include in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2021 certain provisions that would make progress towards a clean audit, including more detailed reporting to Congress on DoD financial management systems. Both of the provisions were ultimately included in the final version of the NDAA.
Earlier this year, Grassley renewed inquiries into potential wasteful and inappropriate travel spending at the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), specifically seeking full and complete answers to prior questions about multiple trips to Hawaii.
Grassley joined Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) to reintroduce the Military Justice Improvement Act in response to reports of mishandling military sexual assaults.
Grassley and Gillibrand also introduced bipartisan legislation to require the military to establish a ""Safe to Report"" policy. According to a Department of Defense report, in fiscal year 2018, only 30% of sexual assaults in the military were reported. Studies show more survivors are empowered to come forward without the threat of retaliation, and the Safe to Report Act empowers survivors of sexual violence to report these incidents without fear of collateral misconduct charges for minor offenses. This legislation was included in the final version of the NDAA.
Also included in the NDAA was a provision that Grassley championed along with other members of the Iowa and Illinois delegation that seeks to improve Army real-estate management. The provision establishes a pilot program to create an online real-estate management system at several Army installations, with the goal of helping the military and federal government use existing resources more efficiently.
Additionally, Grassley expanded his probe into the Department's Office of Net Assessment's (ONA) contract compliance after reviewing troubling documents related to contracts awarded to Professor Stefan Halper. Those documents call into question ONA's stewardship of taxpayer dollars as well as its contract management and internal controls. In early 2019, Grassley requested the DoD Inspector General (IG) review allegations of mismanagement by ONA contracts for political, improper or wasteful activities. Grassley later sought information about ONA contracting processes following a DoD IG audit of the program, which found ONA could not provide sufficient documentation that Halper conducted all of his work in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Pentagon issued a corrective action plan for ONA in August.
On January 23, 2020, Grassley sought an inspector general investigation into the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martin's C-130J aircraft after whistleblower reports alleged a lack of oversight by the DoD has resulted in significant health and safety concerns. On October 8, 2020, Grassley sought additional information from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding the manufacturing practices of Lockheed Martin's C-130J after learning of discrepancies in the initial investigation.
Derecho Recovery:
From year to year, natural disasters take place across the country. In August, many Iowans experienced a historic derecho. Immediately after the storm hit, Grassley visited Cedar Rapids to survey damage, meet with residents affected by the storm and visit a local nonprofit assisting in relief efforts. Grassley and Ernst also participated in a roundtable discussion with 20 nonprofit leaders and the Cedar Rapids Community Foundation. The local nonprofits assisted with housing, case management, mental health, volunteer coordination, food access and legal assistance.
Grassley and Ernst worked with Gov. Reynolds to ensure Iowans would be eligible for federal support including a major disaster declaration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Individual Assistance Program.
Iowa's agricultural community faced significant damage and new challenges resulting from the storm. Grassley led the Iowa congressional delegation in sending a letter to USDA Secretary Perdue urging a prompt approval of Gov. Reynolds Secretarial Disaster Designation request for 57 Iowa counties that suffered losses as a result of the derecho. Following this request, Grassley and Ernst sent an additional letter to USDA requesting it provide additional support for Iowa farmers impacted by the derecho and severe drought. They also sent a letter requesting additional funding for Iowa agricultural cooperatives.
In addition to tens of millions of acres of damaged crops, grain bins across the state were destroyed. Grassley and Ernst requested the U.S. Department of Commerce lift Section 232 tariffs on steel that will be used in Iowa's derecho recovery, especially on steel used for rebuilding grain bins and machine sheds.
Grassley worked with Ernst to file legislation to provide tax relief to Iowans affected by the derecho. The legislation would provide certain employers a tax credit for retaining employees, enhance the tax deduction for disaster-related personal casualty losses, and facilitate enhanced access to tax-exempt retirement plans, among other benefits.
Additionally, Grassley and Ernst worked to ensure Iowans affected by the derecho weren't victims of fraud. They sent a letter to the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate price-gouging scams.
DOJ/FBI:
Grassley and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) continued their investigation into the fatal shooting of Bijan Ghaisar by U.S. Park Police in 2017. Grassley first contacted the FBI in December 2018 about its investigation into the shooting, and the FBI responded in March with little information, prompting a follow-up letter from Grassley. Since then the senators also have pressed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide details on specific reforms being implemented to avoid a repeat of its drawn-out and opaque investigation of U.S. Park Police's fatal shooting of Bijan Ghaisar.
This legislative session, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, persistently contacted U.S. Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray to investigate the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane, to bring transparency to FBI mismanagement. Grassley has long been skeptical of the FBI's justification to spy on Carter Page, including its reliance on the debunked anti-Trump dossier, which was compiled by a former British spy, sub-sourced to Russian officials and paid for by then-candidate Trump's Democrat political opponents. The DOJ inspector general determined the dossier to be central and essential to the FBI's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application. The inspector general also determined the FBI's applications included at least 17 errors and omissions and over 50 errors and omissions in the Woods File. After further reviewing the DOJ OIG report on Crossfire Hurricane, Grassley and Johnson sent Barr a follow up letter requesting the declassification of four footnotes in the report on FISA abuses in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Those footnotes were later declassified and showed how Russian disinformation infected the Steele Dossier.
On April 25, 2019, Grassley and Johnson wrote to the DOJ regarding the FBI and how it may have used a counterintelligence briefing to conduct surveillance on the Trump transition team during Crossfire Hurricane.
In April, Grassley and Johnson requested additional Crossfire Hurricane records after the declassified footnotes revealed the Steele Dossier contained reported Russian disinformation.
On May 12, 2020, Grassley and Johnson requested a list of Obama-era officials that unmasked Lt. Gen. Flynn. In response, the Intelligence Community provided a list that included then-Vice President Biden as one of the Obama-era officials that requested to unmask Flynn.
In November, Grassley and Johnson also sent a letter to Barr requesting the full declassification of briefing notes for then-Director James Comey summarizing the FBI's investigative efforts regarding Crossfire Hurricane.
On October 13, 2020, Grassley and Johnson also sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray warning the bureau's recent production of limited text messages from former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was unacceptable and the FBI must produce all records in compliance with previous requests.
On October 15, 2020, Grassley and Johnson sent another letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe seeking an unredacted version of a spreadsheet created to attempt to corroborate allegations made in the discredited Steele Dossier.
Grassley and Johnson also released a majority staff report detailing how the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Office secretly sought and received access to the private records of Donald J. Trump's presidential transition team, Trump for America, Inc., despite an agreement between the Trump transition team and the General Services Administration that those records were the transition team's private property that would not be retained at the conclusion of the transition. Grassley also pressed DOJ for details on steps taken to recover material deleted from mobile devices assigned to Mueller's team, and investigate potential violations of federal record keeping laws. Many of those deletions occurred after the agency watchdog discovered anti-Trump texts on then-FBI agent Peter Strzok's government-issued phone, and after the DOJ IG began reviewing the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.
On December 1, 2020, news broke that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to be special counsel in his ongoing review of the origins of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation. Grassley praised this decision.
On December 3, 2020, Grassley and Johnson released over 400 pages of records acquired from the DOJ, FBI and State Department during their investigation into the FBI's mishandling of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The production includes recently declassified material that illustrate the flawed decision-making process by federal officials during Crossfire Hurricane.
As part of Grassley's ongoing FARA oversight, he called on the Justice Department to evaluate whether Hunter and James Biden should have registered as foreign agents for their business arrangements with the Chinese government-back energy company CEFC, in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The company was actively seeking to build influence in the United States when it partnered with the Bidens.
Drug Prices:
Grassley has long raised concerns about lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry and the prescription drug supply chain. This year, he also highlighted high prescription drug prices and the concerning trend that the price of many medications are increasing faster than inflation.
One of Grassley's top priorities has been to address the rising costs of prescription drugs. Last year, with Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.) he introduced the bipartisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act (PDPRA). According to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, PDPRA would save taxpayers $95 billion, reduce out-of-pocket spending by $72 billion and reduce premiums by $1 billion. It would also provide peace of mind to millions of seniors and make common, everyday prescriptions, like insulin, more affordable. Unfortunately, Democrats changed their minds and walked away from the negotiating table. Grassley moved forward with his efforts and introduced an updated bill that had growing support from many Republicans including Ernst. President Trump also highlighted this legislation at the annual State of the Union Address and has supported efforts to address prescription drug pricing.
The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for prescription drug pricing reform. As new treatments and therapies enter the marketplace, the American people will want the best medical cures at prices they can afford to pay. PDPRA would help reduce drug prices and secure scientific innovation in a post-pandemic world for generations to come.
As the Senate crafted COVID-19 relief funding, Grassley again urged his colleagues to address prescription drug pricing and include PDPRA in any future relief legislation.
As researchers around the world are racing to find a vaccine to combat COVID-19, Grassley welcomed news from Pfizer and Operation Warp Speed accelerating the response to end the pandemic.
As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley and Wyden also partnered on a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices. They sent letters to leading insulin manufacturers, seeking information regarding recent price increases of up to 500% or more for insulin, a treatment available for diabetes for nearly 100 years. This year, they expanded that investigation and warned those companies that were not cooperating.
Grassley also joined several of his colleagues in introducing the PRICE Transparency Act. This legislation would codify the two health care price transparency rules that came out of President Trump's Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare Executive Order which requires hospitals and insurers to reveal their low, discounted cash prices and negotiated rates to consumers before they receive medical care.
President Trump made prescription drug affordability one of his top priorities. He announced executive orders encouraging domestic manufacturing of drugs and other medical goods critical to public health. Additionally, President Trump worked to address the rising costs of insulin and announced a new Medicare Part D initiative to lower out of pocket insulin expenses for seniors.
On June 2, 2020, Grassley chaired a hearing titled, ""COVID-19 and Beyond: Oversight of the FDA's Foreign Drug Manufacturing Inspection Process."" The hearing was based on Grassley's oversight work on the FDA's foreign drug manufacturing facility inspection process and highlighted the risks associated with drugs manufactured in foreign countries, especially China, and imported to the United States. At the hearing, Grassley introduced into the Committee record thousands of pages of records that he acquired during his FDA investigation relating to China- and India-based drug manufacturing facilities.
Over the years, Grassley has called on pharmaceutical companies to list prices of their prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertisements. In 2019, HHS made good on the promise and finalized a rule requiring price disclosure on TV ads for prescription drugs. However, that rule was challenged by pharmaceutical companies in court and recently overturned. Grassley will continue working to increase transparency from pharmaceutical companies.
Education:
Grassley continued to confront the issue of academic freedom this year. In 2019, he sent letters to the presidents of Duke University, Harvard University, Sarah Lawrence College and Villanova University, seeking information on the current culture of academic freedom on campus. This fall, Grassley followed up on that issue by sending a letter to his colleagues discussing the responses of those colleges and universities. In that letter, he stated the mission of colleges and universities should be to develop the character of young adults by challenging them with new ideas rather than making them feel ""safe."" Grassley concluded his letter by stating, ""[O]ur colleges and universities must ensure that their professors can freely teach their students and that students are free to learn, without retribution.""
Grassley also continued his oversight work relating to Confucius Institutes and urged colleges and universities around the country to request an FBI briefing to fully understand the academic research and national security threats posed by the Chinese government-backed organizations operating on campus. In addition to this letter, Grassley supported the Concerns Over Nations Funding University Campus Institutes in the United States (CONFUCIUS) Act which passed the Senate in July. Grassley has long warned that China leverages its presence in American colleges and universities to spread pro-China propaganda and steal intellectual property.
While working in Washington, Grassley highlighted Iowa's academic excellence for his colleagues. He praised the state's highest four-year graduation rate in Iowa's history, at 91.6 percent. He also applauded the University of Iowa's independent newspaper, The Daily Iowan, which was named the Best All-Around Daily Student Newspaper by the Society of Professional Journalists.
Election Integrity:
With another presidential election in 2020, the spotlight was once again on Iowa and the first in the nation caucuses. The Iowa caucuses are an example of grassroots democracy. While not every part of the caucus went according to plan this year, Grassley joined Ernst and Gov. Reynolds in supporting the integrity of the process and demonstrated the seriousness Iowans take in their civic duty.
The COVID-19 pandemic presented many unique challenges in 2020. However, election officials around the country worked diligently to ensure a safe and secure election this November. In Iowa, Secretary of State Paul Pate mailed an absentee ballot request form to every registered Iowa voter for the November election and the state saw a record turnout.
Grassley urged his colleagues not to play political games with election security. He also commended the Treasury Department's announced sanctions on Russian-aligned actors seeking to influence the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
Congress in March unanimously approved a $10 billion loan for the U.S. Postal Service to respond to pandemic-related uncertainties. However, the USPS assured lawmakers that it had enough cash on hand to maintain operations through next year even without that loan. In fact, the USPS reported a record amount of cash on hand due to the increase in package deliveries during the pandemic. Even with this additional bipartisan funding, many Democrats continued to undermine faith in the electoral process. Grassley strongly condemned such statements on the Senate floor.
Energy:
As a champion of renewable fuels and an all-of-the-above American energy policy, Grassley continued his extensive work to enact responsible energy policies throughout 2020. Grassley was a leader in the effort to allow the sale of year-round E15.
Grassley has continued to lead the fight to maintain a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). He led efforts to pressure the EPA to stop issuing ""hardship waivers"" to obligated refiners as well as make the waiver process more transparent and highlighted the importance of the RFS to President Trump. Grassley joined Ernst in voting against Mark Menezes, nominated to be Deputy Secretary of Energy due to lack of transparency among the agencies.
Much of Grassley's energy agenda focused on the RFS. Grassley worked extensively with Senate colleagues, President Trump and the EPA to expand renewable energy and fulfill congressional intent on the RFS. This year, Grassley slammed the proposed Zero-Emission Vehicles Act which would require 50 percent of sales for new passenger vehicles to be all electric by 2025 and mandate 100 percent of new sales for the U.S. passenger transportation fleet by 2035.
Grassley also joined his colleagues in sending a letter to urge the EPA to modernize its rulemaking for biogenic carbon emissions.
Grassley joined his partner in the Senate, Ernst, in sending a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting clarification on its temporary policy for the manufacture of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than wait for the economy to rebound, biofuel producers across Iowa shifted production to manufacture hand sanitizer to help meet the needs of their communities across the state.
Last year, Grassley and Ernst fought hard to include the biodiesel tax credit in the year-end funding package. In February, the two Iowa senators called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to promptly process 2018-2019 biodiesel tax credit claims.
In addition to ethanol and biodiesel, Grassley highlighted the importance of wind energy in Iowa and around the country.
Grassley also worked to hold Big Oil accountable this year. He joined Sen. Udall (D-N.M.) in introducing the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act of 2020 to modernize the country's antiquated public lands royalty system and increase return to federal and state taxpayers by $200 million in the next decade.
Federal Judiciary:
As a former chairman and senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley rigorously vetted and reviewed judicial nominations to ensure our federal judges will interpret and apply the law as written, not legislate from the bench based on policy preferences.
President Trump has made an effort to nominate constitutionalist and textualist judges who understand the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system. Under Grassley's leadership, the Judiciary Committee oversaw the confirmation of a record 30 circuit court judges, which is the most circuit court confirmations in the first two years of any presidency in history, and in 2020, the Senate has confirmed a record number of circuit court nominees. These confirmations will have an important impact on our country for decades to come.
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away in September, leaving behind a historic legacy that will live on for generations. With an opening on the highest court in the land, Grassley supported Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in moving forward to fill the vacancy. In 2016, citing a divided government, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and his committee colleagues exercised their constitutional authority to withhold consent on any nominee prior to the completion of the election. The circumstances were different in 2020, where the American people elected a Republican President and Senate in 2016 and expanded the Republican Senate majority in 2018.
Later that month, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Grassley met with Judge Barrett and vetted her credentials. Grassley strongly supported Judge Barrett in the hearings and urged his colleagues to support her in the final vote before the full senate. In late October, the Senate approved Judge Barrett's nomination by a vote of 52-48. As Senate President pro tempore, Grassley presided over the vote.
Throughout Justice Barrett's confirmation process, he admonished Democrats who were threatening to pack the courts with partisan judges.
Throughout the pandemic, the Supreme Court allowed live audio streams of oral arguments conducted via teleconference following pandemic-induced lockdowns. The unprecedented live audio feed broadened access to real-time proceedings far beyond the Court's limited seating capacity even in normal times. The move sparked widespread praise from transparency advocates and the general public. Grassley and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) renewed their push to allow live video coverage of court proceedings even after the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
Foster youth, adoption, families and elder care:
Throughout his congressional career, Grassley has advocated for children and families. He continued his work on these issues in 2020 by developing policies aimed at protecting special needs children, preventing elder abuse, encouraging elder independence and promoting funding for programs to improve family health.
Grassley has long been a leader in the effort to protect older Americans, especially those living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Grassley has helped lead congressional oversight of nursing homes and their response to the deadly pandemic.
In April, Grassley wrote to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma regarding several issues related to the outbreak of COVID-19 at long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the country. Grassley expressed concerns about testing capacity, inconsistencies in data tracking, a lack of PPE and transparency in federal spending. Following Grassley's call on CMS to require nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to report all cases of COVID-19 to the federal government, the agency took such steps to ensure transparency and usable data.
In July, Grassley and Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) introduced the Emergency Support for Nursing Homes and Elder Justice Reform Act of 2020, which would improve existing programs to protect older Americans and provide help to nursing homes and their staff providing care for vulnerable residents. The legislation includes several provisions to help nursing homes manage COVID-19 outbreaks, including the establishment of specialty regional ""strike teams"" and extends COVID-19 related reporting requirements through the end of 2020. The bill calls on states receiving federal relief assistance to devote some funding to tele-visitation programs so nursing home residents aren't isolated from family throughout the pandemic. It also renews and reauthorizes funding for several programs enacted in the Elder Justice Act of 2009 and boosts transparency and accountability measures for underperforming nursing homes.
Following the Trump administration's announcement that it would require weekly testing of nursing home staffers and the disbursement of an additional $5 billion in funding to these facilities, Grassley praised the action as a big step in the right direction, which will help further protect the lives and health of both the residents of nursing facilities and the dedicated staff who care for them.
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley continued his oversight work and released a comprehensive report on care in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in the United States during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The report, titled ""COVID-19 and Nursing Homes: What Went Wrong and Next Steps,"" reviews U.S. nursing home performance during the first eight months of the pandemic.
He also sent a letter to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at HHS requesting the OIG initiate an investigation into whether or not five states - California, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania - violated federal guidance in pressuring nursing home facilities to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19.
This year, Grassley also joined a bipartisan resolution designating May 15, 2020 as ""National Senior Fraud Awareness Day,"" to draw attention to the issues of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation. He also authored a resolution recognizing National Foster Care Month, to boost awareness of challenges faced by children in the foster care system. Both passed the Senate unanimously.
Grassley also celebrated National Adoption Month in 2020 and highlighted the unique challenges families have faced throughout the pandemic.
Grassley partnered with Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), to protect seniors with dementia from harm and exploitation. The Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act successfully passed out of the Senate and would ensure the Department of Justice's elder abuse training materials take into account individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
Grassley has spent decades advocating on behalf of older Americans and families of children with special needs and complex medical conditions and authored key provisions in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that was enacted 30 years ago.
Grassley, in his capacity as Senate Finance Committee Chairman, convened a bipartisan working group to address federal paid family leave policies. The working group considered ideas and principles relating to the issue of paid family leave and reviewed existing legislation introduced by several senators on and off the committee and from both parties.
In the year-end COVID-19 economic relief and funding legislative package, Grassley advocated for additional support for the elder community. This legislation included $100 million to support elder justice initiatives, including 50 million for state adult protective service agencies as they cope with unique challenges of serving vulnerable populations during the pandemic.
Good Government and Transparency:
Grassley has been a longtime advocate for inspectors general and government oversight regardless of political party and administration. On April 8, 2020, Grassley led a bipartisan group of lawmakers in calling on President Trump to provide a detailed written explanation for his decision to remove an inspector general. In the letter, the lawmakers underscore the important role inspectors general play in holding agencies accountable and outline the removal procedures, which are designed to prevent political interference. This comes after two inspectors generals were terminated this spring.
On April 14, 2020, Grassley and Wyden wrote to Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, in his role as chair of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), regarding CIGIE's role in the inspector general nominating process. They inquired about the CIGIE recommendation process, the consistency of its advice to the White House, the rate at which its advice is taken by the White House and how often CIGIE has expressed concerns about IG vacancies.
Following complaints from dozens of whistleblowers, Grassley and his colleagues also continued their investigation into whistleblower allegations of low morale and low productivity at the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General.
Additionally, Grassley led a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation to boost oversight of trillions in taxpayer funded pandemic relief by helping the special watchdog quickly onboard critical oversight staff. The Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery Expedited Hiring Authority Act allows the office to bypass the lengthy government hiring process so it can quickly ramp up oversight operations. On December 15, Grassley called on his colleagues to get down to business and pass this bill.
On October 6, 2020, Grassley led a bipartisan letter to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee Conference urging the protection of the work of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). The Senate-passed version of the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included language that would have limited SIGAR's jurisdiction to just six reconstruction funds and severely restricted SIGAR's oversight of reconstruction spending, to exclude oversight authority over internationally monitored trust funds like the World-Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, military construction, human rights and anti-corruption assistance, and certain counternarcotics programs. This section was removed from the House and Senate Conference NDAA, preserving SIGAR's oversight authority over crucial overseas funds.
Grassley joined his colleagues, Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to change the authority of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to conduct a thorough and rigorous review of independent agencies' regulations. Currently, independent agencies are not required to undergo a review by OIRA. They wrote, in part, ""Although these agencies have been created with certain protections designed to insulate them from the political process, they are not a fourth branch of government that is exempt from Congressional and Executive oversight.""
On February 5, 2020 Grassley and Johnson sought records of Hunter Biden's travel while he was under U.S. Secret Service protection as part of their investigation into potential conflicts of interest among the Biden family when Joe Biden was Vice President.
Grassley and Johnson faced unhelpful challenges from their Democratic colleagues regarding their oversight work. In February they rebuked their colleagues who attempted to undermine legitimate oversight by selectively leaking information from their Biden investigation. In August, they urged their colleagues to stop falsely claiming the Ukraine/Biden investigation was subject to Russian disinformation.
On September 23, 2020, Grassley and Johnson released a report that revealed millions of dollars in questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals, including individuals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. They later released a supplemental report with new information which confirmed connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese government, as well as the links between Hunter Biden's business associates and the Russian government.
In October, news broke referencing an alleged Hunter Biden laptop with additional pertinent information relating to Grassley and Johnson's investigation. They immediately sent a letter to United States Secret Service Director James Murray highlighting references to Hunter Biden's travel from recently published emails that appear to align with Secret Service records previously produced to the committees. The chairmen also requested records to verify whether the Secret Service traveled with Hunter Biden after he apparently discontinued his protective detail.
Grassley joined Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) in introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen federal financial management by updating the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. The CFO Act created a new foundation for federal financial management and established a fiscal management reporting and leadership structure.
Additionally, Grassley partnered with Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) to introduce bipartisan legislation to increase transparency and accountability within the federal government. The Oversight.gov Authorization Act would formally authorize the establishment and maintenance of a website to help the public more easily access reports that have been generated by the independent work of Inspectors General.
Grassley, and Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) requested information about the federal government's ability to timely respond to public records requests in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Justice Department's Office of Information Policy (OIP), the senators, all members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted reports of decreased capability to process Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and other concerning developments, including the FBI's decision to stop accepting electronic requests altogether. The senators also released the findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report titled ""Freedom of Information Act: Federal Agencies' Recent Implementation Efforts.""
Grassley continued his work to ensure Social Security remains strong for generations to come. Along with House Ways and Means Ranking Member Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Grassley wrote to the Chief Actuary of Social Security regarding the use of his office for political purposes and pushed for public clarifications to recently published analysis that has allowed for partisan misinformation to be spread by Democrats. As the leading Republican tax writers, Grassley and Brady argued that Social Security's actuaries should not be used for political purposes. The Chief Actuary of Social Security promptly responded with a letter and affirmed that he was ""not aware that anyone has proposed"" legislation like Senate Democrats outlined in a recent request, which they subsequently used to spread false and misleading partisan messaging. Grassley took to the Senate floor to set the record straight and urged his Democratic colleagues to stop spreading misinformation to scare Social Security beneficiaries.
In October, Grassley and Brady again reached out to request more information on how the Office of the Chief Actuary functions, particularly in responding to requests from outside groups, using taxpayer dollars. ""Given the finite resources available and the important services the SSA provides to Americans, it is essential that the agency's budget is used wisely. For that reason, we are seeking additional information regarding practices of the Office of the Chief Actuary for information, analysis, and/or technical assistance requested by non-government individuals and organizations,"" the members wrote.
In December, Grassley and Brady requested that the Chief Actuary of Social Security explain misleading testimony that the actuary presented before a congressional committee in July. In that testimony, the Chief Actuary appeared to have been attempting to provide justification for lack of prior action on an important issue in Social Security by Congress. As the letter from Grassley and Brady to the Chief Actuary identified: ""It is not the job of anyone at the Social Security Administration to justify decisions made by Congress and we are concerned by your recent attempt to do so.
Health Care:
With the COVID-19 pandemic, families faced unique challenges accessing health care services. Recognizing this, Grassley introduced the bipartisan Accelerating Kids' Access to Care Act to help families access life-saving care for children with complex medical conditions. The legislation aims to facilitate access to care while retaining program safeguards and reducing regulatory burdens on providers. This legislation builds off the Grassley-sponsored Advancing Care for Exceptional (ACE) Kids Act, which was signed into law in 2019, which makes it easier for the many providers who treat children with complex conditions to coordinate care and improve outcomes.
In September, Grassley fought to include the Medicare Part B Premium Adjustment provision in the Senate appropriations bill. This will protect Medicare beneficiaries from an expected spike in the Part B premium for 2021 caused by economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grassley also authored a provision to address concerns with the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program. This provision delays the date on which hospitals and other providers must start to repay Medicare Accelerated and Advance payment loans and makes other changes to relax repayment terms, while protecting the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund.
The Senate voted by unanimous consent to pass the Emergency Aid for Returning Americans Affected by Coronavirus Act authored by Grassley and Wyden. This bill would ensure adequate funding be available to help Americans recently brought back to U.S. because of COVID-19.
Throughout the pandemic, Grassley worked with the Trump administration on a variety of health care policies. He praised the Administration's reforms to the Medicaid program which will allow more flexibility for states while they continue to care for and protect individual Americans and communities at most risk.
Grassley also followed up with the FDA this year to ensure Americans can access over-the-counter hearing aids without delay. Grassley's Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, which was signed into law in 2017 to remove outdated regulations blocking consumer access to affordable hearing aids, required the FDA to issue these proposed regulations no later than August 18, 2020, but the FDA has yet to do so.
Grassley partnered with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) to introduce a bipartisan resolution designating the week of October 5 through October 9 2020, as ""Malnutrition Awareness Week."" The resolution recognizes the impact the pandemic has had on vulnerable populations and supports emergency funding for federal nutrition programs to combat malnutrition. Grassley also highlighted mental health awareness month and the services available to Iowans during this difficult time.
Over the years, Congress has considered a number of initiatives aimed at addressing maternal health. Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden asked stakeholders to submit data and findings on factors contributing to poor maternal health outcomes in the United States. The Senate Finance Committee leaders also requested specific, evidence-based solutions to address those factors and improve maternal health. In addition, in June 2020, Grassley wrote a letter to every member of the Senate Finance Committee soliciting ideas for how to address racial and ethnic health disparities.
Grassley also continued his oversight work into the nation's organ donation and procurement system. In October, he sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This probe comes after numerous inspector general audits and news reports raised questions about the adequacy of patient safety standards, suggested thousands of available organs are not being used and highlighted questionable financial practices of some organ procurement organizations (OPOs). This letter is part of the ongoing investigation into the conduct of the nation's organ procurement organizations, and the oversight gaps present in the U.S. organ donation and procurement system. In February, Grassley and Wyden jointly initiated this bipartisan investigation with Senators Young and Cardin when they sent an expansive request for information and data to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which was contracted by Congress nearly four decades ago to oversee the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). This investigation is ongoing.
In April 2019, Grassley and Wyden jointly began investigations of organizations in their home states that provide services to adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). This December, they released two investigative reports regarding the performance and efficacy of providers REM Iowa and MENTOR Oregon, which receive significant federal funding through Medicaid to provide care for individuals with I/DD. Grassley's review of REM Iowa found that the company has had and continues to face problems, including failures to report abuse or neglect, failures to follow an individual's particular care plan and failures to adhere to clients' medication schedules. Grassley's report makes three specific recommendations to REM Iowa: improve training practices for employees, improve access to data and establish a process to track and monitor critical incidents using electronic databases. Grassley's report also recommends that the federal and state governments improve oversight, outreach and support for facilities facing systemic issues.
On December 2, 2020, Grassley wrote a letter to every member of the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committees about the need for new attention to the tax laws governing non-profit hospitals. In late 2019, Grassley announced he was renewing his probe of non-profit, tax-exempt hospitals. ""It's time for Americans to have more financial information available to them when going to the hospital and working with their insurance companies. It's time for Congress to empower Americans to shop for healthcare in a competitive, functional market so as to reduce the costs of care and coverage, and save individuals and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars,"" Grassley wrote.
Housing:
Grassley joined a bipartisan group of senators to introduce legislation to protect property owners whose assets are seized by the federal government. An earlier version of the bill was introduced in 2016, following a Judiciary Committee hearing that examined several concerns associated with law enforcement asset seizure policies and practices. The hearing identified gaps in procedural protections for property owners whose assets were seized despite the absence of criminal charges or convictions. Additionally, many individuals whose assets are seized don't know their rights and don't know how to proceed to challenge the seizure.
Illegal, illicit drugs, and opioids:
In 2020, Grassley continued his longtime work addressing illegal and illicit drug manufacturing and addiction in the U.S. He joined Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in introducing the Methamphetamine Response Act, a bill declaring methamphetamine an emerging drug threat which would require the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to develop, implement and make public a national plan to prevent methamphetamine addiction and overdoses from becoming a crisis. This bill passed the Senate on November 16, 2020 but wasn't considered for final passage in the House of Representatives.
Grassley also cosponsored the Temporary Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. President Trump signed this bill into law in February, which extends a Drug Enforcement Administration temporary scheduling order to proactively control deadly fentanyl analogues. Fentanyl-related overdose deaths continue to rise and sophisticated drug trafficking organizations manipulate dangerous substances to skirt the law, so this critical law placed fentanyl substances in Schedule I so that they can be better detected and criminals can be held accountable for their actions. This Grassley supported law sunsets in May of 2021.
He also joined Feinstein in authoring a resolution designating October as ""National Substance Abuse Prevention Month,"" to help raise awareness about substance use and misuse in the United States.
Grassley and Ernst once again urged Iowans to participate in National Drug Take-Back Day. Unused, unneeded and expired prescription medicines present risk for misuse and theft. Responsible disposal can help prevent accidental poisoning, addiction and overdose deaths.
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Finance Committee, Grassley initiated a bipartisan investigation with Ranking Member Ron Wyden, and sent letters to 10 tax-exempt organizations requesting information about their financial relationship with opioid manufacturers. This is a continuation of the investigation Grassley started in 2012, when he was Ranking Member of Judiciary. This investigation requested payment data, IRS Form 990s, and copies of comments and written materials that the tax-exempt organization sent to Federal task forces, committees, and other advisory groups from 2012 to the present. The purpose of this request was to discover whether these tax-exempt advocacy groups echoed or amplified the messages of pharmaceutical donors to sway public and Federal opinion about opioid prescribing practices. Grassley and Wyden expect to release the findings of their investigation before the end of the year.
Immigration and Visas:
Grassley has been a longtime supporter of the E-verify program and reintroduced the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act this Congress, which would permanently authorize and require employers to use the E-Verify program. E-Verify is an internet-based system that assists employers in determining the eligibility of employees to work in the United States.
Grassley and a bipartisan group of Senators renewed calls for significant regulatory or legislative reforms to the H-2B visa program before increasing the annual visa cap. They raised concerns that the flawed non-agriculture guest worker visa program displaces American workers and can incentivize the exploitation of both foreign and American workers.
Additionally, Grassley sent a letter to Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner Andrew Saul and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Chad Wolf seeking information on why SSA was not providing the statutorily required information to DHS regarding noncitizens working on and reporting wage earnings to non-work Social Security Numbers (SSNs). Grassley's letter follows a concerning SSA Inspector General report that discussed the issue last year. The use of non-work SSNs to obtain employment and work illegally is not an insignificant problem. The OIG report stated that approximately 364,000 people with non-work SSNs reported billions of dollars in wages over a 3-year tax period from 2014-2016.
Grassley joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to introduce legislation to reform and close loopholes in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act would prioritize American workers and restore fairness in visa programs for skilled foreign workers. The legislation reinstates Congress' original intent in the H-1B and L-1 visa programs by increasing enforcement, modifying wage requirements and securing protections for both American workers and visa holders. Grassley also praised the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security this year as they worked to address abuses in the high-skilled guest worker program that has been used to displace American workers with low-paid foreign labor.
Grassley sought information on a number of cases in which a crime was carried out by someone who was in the United States illegally. Grassley and Ernst requested answers regarding a suspected al Qaeda leader wanted for murdering two Iraqi police officers who was able to receive refugee status in the United States and later become a U.S. citizen. He also joined a group of Republican senators to investigate how a Mexican national illegally in the country was never removed despite having a history of violent and illegal behavior that culminated in the deaths of four law enforcement motorcycle club members. Ivan Robles Navejas is charged with causing a head-on collision with members of the Thin Blue Line Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club in July, killing four riders and injuring several others. He was allegedly intoxicated at the time of the collision, and had previously faced assault, drunk driving and resisting arrest charges dating back to 2013.
In the past, Grassley has raised concerns about visa mills that masquerade as educational institutions but actually function as de facto employment agencies that help aliens fraudulently enter the United States under F-1 student visas. Grassley continued his oversight of F-1 visa fraud in 2020 by pressing DHS about the steps it is taking to crack down on fraudulent companies providing fake employment offers to foreign students seeking to extend their F-1 visas and remain in the U.S. after graduation.
Impeachment:
At the beginning of the year, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced she would transmit articles of impeachment to the United States Senate. As president pro tempore of the Senate, Grassley presided over the opening of the impeachment trial of President Trump. Throughout the trial, Grassley fulfilled his duty to thoughtfully consider all the facts.
Following the proceedings, he criticized the House's flawed process and evolving arguments, and expressed the importance of respecting precedent. Removing a president for legal actions based on a flawed and partisan process, especially in the midst of an election year, would set a dangerous standard for future impeachments. He ultimately rejected the articles of impeachment on constitutional, legal and prudential grounds.
Infrastructure:
Grassley continued to address the increased need for rural broadband in 2020. Grassley has a long history of working to close the digital divide in Iowa. He is a strong advocate for rural broadband deployment and providing the tools necessary to make sure rural America is not left behind. Grassley supported the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act that requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue new rules to require the collection and dissemination of granular broadband availability data and to establish a process to verify the accuracy of such data. President Trump signed this bill into law in March. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 fully funds the Broadband DATA Act.
He also highlighted the Federal Highway Administration's proposed new rule to advance broadband technology in rural America. The proposed rule would help improve coordination and utilize construction projects for installation of broadband infrastructure.
In 2019, Iowa faced devastating and historic flooding across the state. Grassley and Ernst held a hearing in Southwest Iowa that focused on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) management of the Missouri River. They closely monitored the situation along the western border and sent a letter urging the USACE to provide additional funding for projects to improve safety and navigation on the lower Missouri River. Grassley praised the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) for helping fund critical projects to help with flood recovery, including the announcement awarding a $7.9 million grant to the city of Hamburg, Iowa, to make critical infrastructure improvements needed to protect businesses along the Missouri River from flooding. This EDA grant, to be matched with $1.9 million in local investment, is expected to create or retain 349 jobs.
Grassley also joined Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) to introduce new legislation to overhaul the USACE process for managing water resource projects along the lower Missouri River system. The Lower Missouri River Flood Prevention Program Act would require the USACE to implement a new system-wide approach to water development projects to reduce flood risk and improve flood protection along the lower Missouri River.
On the other side of the state, Grassley praised the Corps' decision to approve three Port Statistical Areas (PSAs) on the Mississippi River. This federal recognition as a multi-modal port region will be leveraged by local governments and businesses for marketing and economic development that will improve regional, national and global competitiveness.
Grassley praised the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (WRDA) which was included in the year-end funding bill. WRDA addresses the civil works program of the Army Corps of Engineers. Grassley advocated for a number of provisions that were incorporated in the final bill including the Inland Waterway Trust Fund Cost Share Program. This provision modifies the cost share for construction or major rehabilitation of a project on the inland waterways to 65 percent from the general fund of the Treasury and 35 percent from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund.
Grassley also worked to include a provision that would make temporary flood control structures permanent. This provision creates a new authority for the Corps to review whether temporary flood control structures it has constructed should be made permanent, and allows the local cost-share for making them permanent to be waived for communities that are small, financially disadvantaged or at risk of recurring flooding.
Additionally, Grassley was vocal to include a provision to update the Des Moines Birdland Levee. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorized the Des Moines and Raccoon River project which was completed in 2012. However, due to design deficiencies by the Corps, approximately 1.7 miles of this levee does not meet the Corps' design criteria for under-seepage. This additional authorized funding will bring the deficient portion of the levee up to Corps standards.
The final bill also contains important provisions for Iowans including expanding work on a Lower Missouri River Basin Flood Risk Resiliency Plan, expedited completion of maintenance and repair activities for federally operated and maintained levees systems in the Lower Missouri River basin, expedited processing of permits and approvals of repairs of flood control infrastructure caused by flood in 2019, changes to the PL 84-99 non-federal levee program to enhance flood protections, further prohibitions of Interception-Rearing Complex's (IRc's), continuation of work on the Upper Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan along with several other provisions critical to flood control and navigation.
Grassley partnered with Ernst and went to bat for Iowa Minor League Baseball this year. They joined a bipartisan resolution and urged support for preserving Minor League Baseball clubs across the country, including those in Davenport, Burlington and Clinton, in response to Major League Baseball's (MLB) proposal to eliminate 42 teams nationwide. The Des Moines Iowa Cubs, Cedar Rapids Kernels, and the Quad Cities River Bandits are all retaining affiliation with MLB teams in the region. The Clinton LumberKings and Burlington Bees will have opportunities to join other leagues.
Law Enforcement:
To honor the service and sacrifice made by the men and women in law enforcement, Grassley supported a resolution designating the week of May 11 through May 17, 2020, as ""National Police Week.""
During Police Week, a bipartisan package of law enforcement bills championed by Grassley sailed through the Senate, including the Confidentiality Opportunities for Peer Support (COPS) Counseling Act. Senator Grassley is the lead Republican on this bill, which provides mental health support to law enforcement by encouraging the adoption of peer counselling programs, while protecting the privacy of federal officers who participate.
The Judiciary Committee also advanced the Grassley supported Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act, which requires the FBI to collect voluntarily submitted, anonymous data on police suicides and attempted suicides from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Collecting this data will help inform policy solutions to promote prevention of law enforcement suicides.
Grassley also supported legislation to help the nation's first responders. Without skipping a beat, first responders adapted to the ever-changing demands of the pandemic. Grassley and a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation to ensure families of public safety officers lost to COVID-19 can quickly access survivor benefits. The Safeguarding America's First Responders Act (SAFR) clarifies the certification requirements for survivor benefits under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program to account for the unique challenges presented by the pandemic. In August, President Trump signed this bill into law.
These three bills - along with the resolution commemorating National Police Week - won unanimous approval in the Senate.
This year, many Americans called for Congress to enact police reforms. Grassley supported Sen. Tim Scott's (R-S.C.) proposal. The JUSTICE Act included bipartisan provisions to improve accountability and transparency in policing. It also designated lynching as a federal hate crime and penalized states for allowing police to use chokeholds. However, this legislation did not move forward on the Senate floor because Senate Democrats refused to even debate the legislation or work with Scott or other senators on police reform legislation.
National Security:
This year, President Trump made a historic breakthrough for peace in the Middle East with the signing of the Abraham Accords. This is the first tangible progress in a quarter century. Grassley met Anwar Sadat at the time of the Camp David Accords in 1978 and witnessed the handshake between Rabin and Arafat in 1993.
An Iowan, Mr. Christopher Miller, was nominated to be Director of the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Grassley had the honor to introduce him at his confirmation hearing. Christopher Miller is currently serving as the Acting Secretary of Defense.
Grassley joined 42 Senate colleagues in supporting a resolution honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who carried out the successful mission that killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) and a designated terrorist.
Grassley also joined his Senate colleagues in commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998. The senators called on the Trump administration and Congress ""to deliver justice to the victims and their families and appropriately and equitably address terrorism-related claims against Sudan.""
On June 5, 2020, Grassley chaired a hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research titled, ""Foreign Threats to Taxpayer-Funded Research: Oversight Opportunities and Policy Solutions."" That same day, Grassley held a classified member-level briefing on the same subject. Grassley is a leading voice in the effort to protect the integrity of taxpayer-funded research. In addition to his inquiries to DoD, Grassley also pressed the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Health and Human Services Inspector General, Justice Department, and Government Accountability Office on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research.
Presidential Nominations:
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley carried out the Senate's constitutionally mandated ""advice and consent"" responsibilities respecting presidential nominations to many key departments and agencies. During the 116th Congress, the Finance Committee reported 21 individual nominations to the full Senate and 19 of those have been confirmed, including: Andrew M. Saul to be Commissioner of Social Security, Brent James McIntosh to be an Under Secretary of the Treasury, and Michael J. Desmond to be Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service.
Reform to Victims' Rights Laws:
Grassley continued to stand up for victims of human trafficking. Grassley joined his colleagues in supporting a resolution observing National Trafficking, Modern Slavery Prevention Month. He was also a recipient of the 2020 Outstanding Anti-Human Trafficking Service Award from Gov. Reynolds.
In 2020, Grassley continued his work to prevent abuse of young athletes. He introduced legislation, the Stopping Abuse From Entering Sports, Promoting Oversight, Responsibility And Transparency (SAFESPORT) Act. It builds on an earlier measure Grassley cosponsored and shepherded through the Judiciary Committee in 2018, during his tenure as that committee's chairman. His latest proposal includes funding accountability measures, anti-retaliation protections, child abuse reporting requirements, and other reforms. The Senate passed this landmark legislation in August.
Grassley also joined his colleagues in introducing several bipartisan Senate resolutions to support victims of sexual and domestic violence. One expresses support for National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month and another honors those who have worked to help crime victims during the pandemic. These measures passed the Senate by unanimous consent.
Grassley also joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in introducing the Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act to provide more efficient help to Americans whose social security numbers have been stolen and misused.
Grassley praised the U.S. House of Representatives broad bipartisan approval of anti-lynching legislation this year. The bill is similar to bipartisan legislation Grassley led through the Judiciary Committee in 2018, and which passed unanimously in the Senate last year.
Religious Freedoms:
The Declaration of Independence recognizes each individual is endowed with unalienable rights. However, countries around the world still have blasphemy laws with religious persecution still taking place. In October 2018, Grassley sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing concerns about the ongoing religious persecution of religious minorities by the communist regime in China. The State Department placed visa restrictions last fall on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention or abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs or other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China. Grassley has continued to monitor this situation and hold world organizations accountable for their complicit support of China.
Second Amendment:
Grassley and his colleagues encouraged the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to continue protecting public safety while respecting the Second Amendment and federal law during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
They wrote, ""As our country continues to respond to the pandemic, we are seeking additional information on the impact the coronavirus has had on your agencies and the firearm transfer process so that we have a clearer picture on where things stand and how we can better assist through the legislative and appropriations process.""
Grassley also joined a letter with Senator Braun and other colleagues to Attorney General Barr and ATF Acting Director Lombardo to share their concern about the ATF practice of relying on non-public standards in its regulation of the importation of pistol stabilizing braces. The letter requests that ATF clearly articulate its position on the regulation of pistol braces, as a ""know it when you see it"" approach to firearms by the ATF can quickly become a slippery slope for all legal American gun owners as well as government firearm regulation enforcement.
Taxes:
Grassley was instrumental in the crafting and passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed into law by President Trump. Throughout 2020, taxpayers across the country saw the benefits of these important tax reforms.
After assuming the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee in January, 2019, Grassley worked closely with the Treasury Department as it issued regulations and other guidance related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provided clarity to families, farmers, cooperatives, and businesses - small to large - on changes to the business tax rules including the 20-percent deduction for pass-through businesses, the opportunity zones initiative, and international tax laws.
Following this work, Grassley raised concerns about Joe Biden's tax proposals. Biden vowed to raise taxes immediately on U.S. businesses, undo the 2017 tax law and impose trillions of dollars in tax hikes on individuals and businesses.
As Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley convened a hearing on the 2020 tax filing season and the IRS' handling of the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. Throughout this hearing, Grassley questioned how the IRS was managing its standard responsibilities during the pandemic while also implementing a number of tax measures enacted by Congress to provide relief to individuals and businesses.
During this legislative session, Grassley continued to advocate for retirement savings reform. He authored the Retirement Enhancement and Savings (RESA) Act of 2019, which formed the basis of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019 that was included in the 2019 year-end appropriations package. This legislation will help more Americans save for their retirement and allow more American businesses to invest in their employees' future financial security by improving access to retirement savings plans through the creation of multiple employer plan retirement programs.
Grassley also joined Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) who chairs the Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee, in releasing a comprehensive reform package to address the financial crisis in the multiemployer pension plan system. The Multiemployer Pension Recapitalization and Reform Plan would provide targeted financial assistance to a number of large severely underfunded multiemployer plans and reform the overall system to protect workers and retirees from financial hardships resulting from the failure of their multiemployer pension plan. Since the release of the plan, Grassley has pursued bipartisan discussions to develop a consensus agreement to reform the multiemployer system for the long-term.
In August, Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden concluded their investigation into syndicated conservation-easement transactions and released a report on that investigation. The report found those transactions ""to be nothing more than retail tax shelters that let taxpayers buy tax deductions at the end of any given year, ... which thousands of taxpayers used to game the tax code and deprive the federal government of billions of dollars in revenue."" It concluded that ""the IRS has strong reason for taking enforcement action against syndicated conservation-easement transactions as it has to date"" and called on Congress, the IRS, and the Department of the Treasury to take further action to preserve the integrity of the conservation-easement tax deduction.
To that end, Grassley joined Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) in reintroducing the Charitable Conservation Easement Program Integrity Act, which would protect conservation easements from abuse, save taxpayers billions of dollars and promote conservation around the country.
Grassley also continued to advocate for clean energy tax policies in Congress. In January, he joined his colleagues in sending a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig requesting information to better understand how the IRS enforces the electric vehicle tax credit in light of a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration audit report that detailed what appear to be systemic problems with the tax-credit program. And in February, he called out Senate Democrats' on their misleading and baseless letter regarding energy tax policies that ignore recent and longer-term history on how to successfully enact bipartisan green energy policies.
Grassley worked with Wyden to support the Treasury Department's participation in the multilateral process at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is intended to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the global economy. In letters and other communications throughout this legislative session, Grassley and Wyden expressed their strong bipartisan opposition to unilateral digital services taxes (DSTs) that target and discriminate against U.S.-based companies operating around the world. Earlier this year, Grassley and Wyden supported an agreement between the United States and France postponing the imposition of the French digital services tax in favor of reaching a multilateral agreement at the OECD. Grassley and Wyden also opposed a U.K. digital service tax that took effect in July. With additional DSTs being introduced or considered by U.S. trading partners, Grassley and Wyden voiced support for USTR's investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act of foreign DSTs. Grassley and Wyden also supported USTR's decision to impose additional tariffs on French goods after a 180-day deferral period.
Trade:
The state of trade policy took center stage in 2020. Grassley was a central figure in the debate, advocating vigorously on behalf of Iowa's interests.
In the last three years, Grassley provided extensive support to the President's efforts to renegotiate NAFTA. The updated trade pact reached by the President is called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - and provides a host of new benefits for America's farmers, workers, and manufacturers. The nonpartisan International Trade Commission estimates that USMCA will add more than $68 billion to U.S. gross domestic product and generate 176,000 jobs.
As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley worked closely with committee members and the Administration to guide USMCA through Congress. Democrats in the House of Representatives unreasonably delayed passage of USMCA last year. However, in January, USMCA finally passed with broad bipartisan support.
As part of ensuring that USMCA was passed, Grassley made clear the Administration's national security steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico would have to be dropped - as would those countries' retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. All sides' tariffs came down - and Iowa's farmers regained access to two of their most important markets.
As President pro tempore of the Senate, Grassley led an enrollment ceremony to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) Implementation Act. Grassley's signing of the legislation was the final step before it went to the president for his signature to become law. Grassley then attended the USMCA signing ceremony at the White House.
Grassley has long recognized the World Trade Organization (WTO) can be a powerful tool to remove foreign trade barriers. However, the WTO needs significant reform - particularly in light of its failure to address China's abusive trade practices. Grassley held a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the road ahead for the WTO.
Grassley also supported the President in confronting China on its abusive trade practices. Grassley welcomed the Phase 1 deal the President reached with China. Iowans, especially hog, corn and soybean farmers, will benefit from provisions in the deal that remove trade barriers, and commit China to increasing purchases of agricultural products. Grassley also attended the Phase 1 deal signing ceremony at the White House.
The U.S. continued to expand its market this year with ethanol in Brazil. Grassley praised the new agreement which will allow 198 million gallons of ethanol into the country duty-free with imported gallons beyond that subject to the 20 percent tariff. Brazil was the largest U.S. ethanol export market last year, purchasing 332 million gallons of U.S.-produced ethanol worth $493 million.
To address the disruptions and deficient supplies due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Grassley and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) called for an expedited investigation to identify the products that may be needed to respond to the pandemic. The lawmakers requested the Commission produce a report by April 30 detailing the tariff classifications and applicable rates of duty associated with the products to assist the Committees in their work to combat the coronavirus emergency. Following the initial report, Grassley and his colleagues again wrote to the Commission to conduct a follow-on investigation and prepare a report as there were persistent challenges in meeting supply for these critical products.
Over the summer, Grassley held a series of hearings titled, ""Protecting the Reliability of the U.S. Medical Supply Chain During the COVID-19 Pandemic."" Grassley highlighted the pandemic brings greater urgency to efforts to build resiliencies into our essential supply chains required to avoid shortages and protect American lives.
Veterans:
In 2020, Grassley continued hosting Iowa veterans to participate in the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project. Established by Congress in 2000, the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress collects, preserves and makes accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. To date, more than 1,200 stories from Iowans have been recorded for the project. In November of 2018, Grassley's office interviewed Iowa veterans at the Iowa Gold Star Museum at Camp Dodge in Des Moines to document their service to the nation. In May, he delivered 20 veterans' recorded interviews and documents. In November of 2019, Grassley's office interviewed Iowa veterans at Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown. In December, he delivered 11 veterans' recorded interviews and documents. This year, Grassley's staff interviewed Iowa veterans at the Waverly Area Veterans Post.
The Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act, authored by Sen. Ernst and cosponsored by Sens. Grassley, John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) unanimously passed the Senate in July. This bill requires that every health care provider hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with a revoked license must undergo a third party review of that provider's care. If the review determines that a competent practitioner would have managed the veteran's care differently, the veteran will be notified.
The U.S. Secretary of Interior announced at the Iowa Gold Star Military Museum in Johnston that starting on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, 2020, all U.S. veterans and Gold Star families will be given free entry into national parks, federal lands and wildlife refuges managed by the U.S. Department of Interior. This new, lifetime benefit provides free admission for millions of veterans and their families. Grassley praised this announcement and honored all the nation's veterans for their dedication and sacrifice.
Additionally, Grassley urged his colleagues to join him in his decades-long effort to establish a memorial on the National Mall to those Black Revolutionary War patriots who fought for the founding of our country.
Whistleblowers:
As a staunch proponent of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government and as a founding member of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, Grassley has long championed the cause of whistleblowers.
In March, Grassley introduced an amendment to the American Energy Innovation Act. This amendment addresses a critical shortcoming with the whistleblower protections currently available to the power sector employees responsible for maintaining and securing our nation's electric grid. It also makes it clear that power sector employees who report threats to our electric grid are protected from retaliation.
Grassley also introduced the CFTC Fund Management Act. This legislation includes important updates to the Commodity Future Trading Commission's highly successful whistleblower program, including an increase to the statutory cap for the fund used to pay whistleblower awards and new audit requirements designed to increase transparency.
The federal government recovered more than $3 billion in taxpayer dollars lost to fraud in 2019, using a law championed by Grassley. Whistleblower claims account for more than two-thirds of those recoveries. Since its enactment in 1986, the False Claims Act is responsible for more than $62 billion in recoveries, with Grassley's whistleblower provision saving taxpayers more than $44.7 billion.
To honor the critical role played by whistleblowers in promoting good governance, Grassley introduced a resolution designating July 30, 2020, as ""National Whistleblower Appreciation Day."" It passed the Senate by unanimous consent.
This year, our country faced down a worldwide pandemic that produced a prolonged economic crisis. Although these are clearly divisive times, Grassley continued his work as one of the most bipartisan legislators in the Senate, working with his colleagues across the aisle to find solutions to the pressing problems we faced in 2020. Grassley looks forward to continuing that work in 2021, when he will once again assume Republican leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee even as he continues his important work on behalf of Iowans on the Finance, Budget, and Agriculture Committees.

TYPE: NEWS EVENT
SPEAKER: MARY TRUMP, AUTHOR, 'TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH
CHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: Mary Trump is a big deal. Why? 
 She's the president's niece. So, as a niece, she's been around him for a long time, when cameras aren't around, when people speak freely. 
 She's also a record-breaking bestselling author now because of her new tell-all book. But it's what this book does. You haven't seen something like this before, because it's a look at the man, the man in the context of his own family, and in a history of dirty business. 
 ""Too Much and Never Enough"" is the title, ""How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,"" nearly a million copies within a single day. It's number one on Amazon's bestseller list. 
 So, this comes because the Trump family lost a court battle to keep this book under wraps. A lawsuit that Mary Trump says was completely motivated by her uncle Donald. 
 Mary Trump also revealed herself to be the source for ""The New York Times""' Pulitzer Prize-winning story about Trump's engagement in tax schemes. 
 She was freed from a restraining order this week to discuss the book. This is the longest interview, I believe, she's done, and it's worth it. She joins us now on PRIME TIME. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: Mary Trump, welcome to PRIME TIME. 
MARY TRUMP, AUTHOR, 'TOO MUCH AND NEVER ENOUGH: HOW MY FAMILY 
CREATED THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS MAN': Thanks, Chris. It's great to be here. 
CUOMO: Appreciate you taking the opportunity. 
 I was going to start the interview by saying you were pretty in rare air. You had written something about the president that is certainly critical in certain aspects, and he hadn't said anything back. 
 That just changed moments ago. He lumped you in with John Bolton, referring to what he calls the book of the month club. He calls John Bolton a lowlife and a dummy. 
 You do well by comparison. He comes to you second. He says: ""Next up is Mary Trump, a seldom-seen niece, who knows a little about me, says untruthful things about my wonderful parents, who couldn't stand her, and me, and violated her NDA,"" nondisclosure agreement. ""She also broke the law by giving out my tax returns. She's a mess."" 
 Response? 
 M. TRUMP: It's hard to know where to start, so let's start with the easy stuff first. 
 A court ruled that I did not break the NDA, which is why I'm able to be here with you this evening. I never had Donald's tax returns in my possession, so I could not have released them to anybody. The documents I had were legally mine, which I obtained through discovery during the lawsuit I was engaged in with my family almost 20 years ago and were predominantly my grandfather's tax documents and his businesses' tax documents. 
 As for being seldom seen, I guess, for Donald, that is one of the biggest insults you can hurl at somebody. But I'm -- I have been fine with it. And... 
CUOMO: Why is it an insult for him? 
 M. TRUMP: I think he thinks being seen is something he values. So, I'm not entirely sure. 
 (CROSSTALK) 
CUOMO: Do you know him? Have you been around him enough to form an opinion? 
 M. TRUMP: Of course. He was my dad's younger brother. 
 We spent huge amounts of time in the house growing up. And Donald was there frequently. My uncle Rob was there frequently, my aunts. So, of course. We spent every holiday together, pretty much until my grandfather died in 1999. 
CUOMO: And after that? 
 M. TRUMP: You know, it's hard to stay together as a family after you have been disinherited and there has been a fairly bitter lawsuit. 
 So, yes, since 1999, there has been very little contact. But, before then, he hired me to write his book for him, his second book. So, that doesn't exactly square with my not being part of the family or my not having any knowledge of him. 
 And, as for my grandparents not being able to stand me, I think, if that were true, it would say more about them than it says about me. But, certainly, in the case of my grandmother, it was not true. We were very close. I really loved her and believe that she loved me. 
 And my grandfather, I don't think was really -- had real positive feelings towards anybody, except perhaps Donald. 
CUOMO: The idea of ""She's a mess,"" other than trying to discredit the book and your credibility, what do you think he's referring to? 
 M. TRUMP: I think it's just an attack he hurls, predominantly, I think, about women. 
 And, honestly, I'm in very good company. I believe he said the same thing about Nancy Pelosi. And I'm fine with that. 
CUOMO: Let's take one step sideways. 
 Do you think -- knowing your uncle the way you do, do you think he believes that you violated the NDA? Do you think he believes the things that he says? Or do you think that he says what he thinks is effective? 
 M. TRUMP: You know, interestingly, I think both things can be true at the same time. 
 In this particular case, I honestly don't know, because, very often, what he says and/or believes depends upon who has his ear in the moment. 
CUOMO: What does that mean? 
 M. TRUMP: That means that, if somebody close to him is spinning facts in a way that are easier for him to take or believe, then he will. 
 I mean, a judge made a ruling. So, if he's not believing the judge, the judge's decision, then, clearly, he's listening to somebody else. 
 (END VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: Is it really that simple? 
 A look inside how he was before he was president with somebody who was right there, Mary Trump. 
 The president claims he knows little about her. But she's got plenty of examples and firsthand experiences about him -- next. 
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
CUOMO: We're back now one-on-one with Mary Trump, the president's niece. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: Inside the family, was he known as the smart one? 
 M. TRUMP: No, not at all. 
CUOMO: How was he regarded, in your experience, when he wasn't around, I guess, more often than when he was? 
 M. TRUMP: You know, growing up, it's very difficult to gauge things like that, because, you know, it's my dad, it's my aunts, it's my uncles, my grandparents. So, there wouldn't have been any discussion along those lines when I was a kid. 
 What I did know with absolute certainty was that he was absolutely the preferred child. And because of that, and because of how he was presented to the world and within the family, it was very easy to believe that he was incredibly successful on his own. 
 So, it wasn't until much later that I was able to tease out the truth of the fact that he really had been supported by my grandfather throughout. 
CUOMO: You answered quickly when I said, was he known as the smart one? You said, no. 
 Why such a quick assessment? 
 M. TRUMP: Well, he hasn't changed much. 
 And I think, if we only knew him now and extrapolated backwards, it would be pretty obvious. He's not intellectual. He doesn't seem to have any interest in learning. He has no intellectual curiosity. And being well-educated does not make you well-informed. 
CUOMO: Hmm. 
 And when you were a kid, and growing up, what do you remember about him in terms of bearing and how he was with you and others? 
 M. TRUMP: He was supremely confident. He didn't have any reason not to be, really. 
 He could be dismissive. He wasn't very interested in hanging out with us a lot. We would play ball in the backyard once in a while, but he had other, more important things to attend to. 
 I mean, we got along, you know? And he wouldn't -- he wouldn't have hired me to write his book if he had hated me or thought badly of me. So -- but I think it is fair to say that we didn't really spend time together until I was working for him, when I was in my 20s. 
CUOMO: A couple of things that jumped out at me, looking in the book. 
 I often -- it always matters to me how somebody begins a book, not with their material, but often what they have in a preface and a quote or something that suggests direction. 
 You have a quote ""Les Mis"" about, when a soul is in darkness... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: ... sin may come, but the problem isn't the person who sins. It's the person who created the darkness. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: What does that quote mean to you, in the context of you and writing this book? 
 M. TRUMP: Well, I think the reason I decided to use that quote, ultimately, was because it worked on two very important levels that fit in really nicely with what I was trying to convey in the book. 
 So, in the context of my family, the person creating the darkness was my grandfather. And the person creating the sins in that darkness would have been Donald. 
 Now we're in a situation where it's Donald and his enablers creating the darkness, and the less -- the rest of us are left to stumble around as best we can, and sometimes doing the wrong things, because we're not being led. We're not -- the truth is not being leveled at us. 
 So, it could be something as simple as wearing a mask or as egregious as committing hate crimes, which seem to be, sadly, endorsed, to some degree, by this administration. 
 (END VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: So, where does that lead Mary Trump? 
 More with her next. We will be right back. 
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
CUOMO: All right. I'm Chris Cuomo. Welcome back to PRIME TIME. We're two hours tonight. Let's not waste a moment of it. 
 You have been listening to the niece of President Trump, Mary Trump, tell us not just how she feels about her uncle, but an analysis of someone who grew up with him, but now is a clinician. She's a psychologist. 
 Here's more of an in-depth interview now. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: It's interesting to me, because my -- my central criticism of your uncle is that he knows better. 
 I do not ascribe to this notion of him as a stupid man. Educated, not education, erudition, we can talk about these things. I don't think they really matter. 
 The ability to know what is true and not true and how you deal with that, I think, is obviously the commodity. 
 M. TRUMP: Sure. 
CUOMO: And I think he is smart enough to know, and he says things anyway. 
 And I wonder if that was your experience in the family, that he would say things. It's certainly the case with your lawsuit against him from 20 years ago. 
 M. TRUMP: Mm-hmm. 
CUOMO: I mean, that's basically a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: ... that your aunts and uncles, including Donald Trump, had a responsibility to be straight with you about what things were worth, and they weren't. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: And that's the lawsuit. 
 But, in general, was he known as somebody where, yes, the guy just doesn't tell you the truth? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, you know, I'm really glad that you brought that issue up, because I'm not at all saying that Donald shouldn't be held accountable. He does, in some -- on some levels, know what he's doing. 
 I think one of the reasons he's sort of unraveling a bit now is because what he's always done in the past that used to work isn't really working as effectively anymore. So, it has him scrambling a bit. 
 But you know knowing, not knowing, educated, not educated, as you say, ultimately, it is irrelevant, just as, is in the grand scheme of things, although it's, I think, extremely useful in some ways to understand his psychology, it's irrelevant, compared to what he's doing. 
 You know, that's what we need to focus on. 
CUOMO: Right. And, of course, the two go together. There's a conflation, because he's acting on what he says he knows and doesn't know. 
 But I have to believe he knows that masks are helpful. I have to believe that he understands we're in the middle of a pandemic... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: ... and that he just sees his best opportunities in ignoring that, because that's bad for him. 
 And his problem is more of an ethical or a moral one, not an intellectual one. What's your take on that? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, I actually write about how easy it would have been for him to be the hero in this story. 
CUOMO: Mm-hmm. Still could. 
 (CROSSTALK) 
CUOMO: By the way, as crazy as politics is, and how short people's memories are... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: ... he could still be a hero by putting together a plan that gets this country in a better place. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: Between now and November is a long time. 
 Continue. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
 Well, and you hit on something really important. He could, theoretically. But he can't, constitutionally. And that's why we -- it's not because he doesn't know masks are good. It's not because he is rabidly anti-science. 
 It's because those things work for the narrative he needs to spin. So, it would require him to admit, in one way or another, that he's made a mistake, a huge mistake, that's cost many, many tens of thousands of lives. He can't do that. 
 So, all he's got left is creating division. And that's a place in which he's very, very comfortable. 
CUOMO: You depict in many different ways and scenarios what the feeling about Donald Trump's character was within the family. 
 As a general assessment, how is he regarded? You have said he was confident. He was certainly the favored child. But on these kind of primary color issues, you know, credibility, compassion, good person, bad person, families talk. What was the rap on him? 
 M. TRUMP: When I was growing up? 
CUOMO: Yes. 
 M. TRUMP: None of those were ever issues in my family. Never. 
CUOMO: You mean they weren't relevant considerations? 
 M. TRUMP: That's right. 
 My grandfather was running the show, and they were totally irrelevant considerations to him. So, they didn't matter to anybody else either. 
CUOMO: Was a little cold-blooded there. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, quite. 
CUOMO: What was that like for you? 
 M. TRUMP: You know, again, when you're growing up in an atmosphere like that, it's very hard to understand that it's not normal or that it's dysfunctional or abhorrent in any way. 
 So, you know, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't have thought anything of it, necessarily. But, on the other hand, I did witness particularly how it affected my dad. And even though I didn't understand it at the time, I certainly understand it now. 
 And being in a family that did not value the things we were just talking about, and also not being able to subscribe to them, not being able to be the killer, or not being able to be the person who is uncaring or unflinching, it was brutal. 
CUOMO: Your father passed at a young age, 42, I believe. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: Yes? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: And as the president has referred to him having struggles, he usually talks to it -- about in terms of alcohol. 
 Did he have a compassionate relationship with your father, in terms of his addiction? 
 M. TRUMP: No. 
 No, he wouldn't have. My dad's alcoholism, which has a very, very significant genetic component and is a disease, was looked upon as a weakness and a moral failing, a failure of character. 
 So, no, there was no compassion. 
CUOMO: Did they have a close relationship ever in your life? 
 M. TRUMP: No. 
 And part of that is -- is the age difference. They were seven-and-a-half years apart. I know that doesn't always mean that brothers can't be close. 
CUOMO: Right. 
 M. TRUMP: But they were really living very different lives. 
 By the time -- when Donald was in high school, my dad was married already with kids. And when Donald was in college, my dad was flying. So, you know, they -- their paths crossed, certainly, but I wouldn't say they were close. 
 I'm not entirely sure Donald is capable of being truly emotionally close with anybody. 
CUOMO: Two criteria questions in terms of why you approach this the way you do. 
 The president and people around him have a pretty straight-line analysis on you, which is: She's out to get him. She's never liked him. She's the oddball in the family. And this is about bitterness. She's upset about her dad and what happened with the lawsuit. 
 Are those fair criticisms, that you don't like Donald Trump, for reasons that are personal to you, and you are projecting them on to him as a president? 
 M. TRUMP: No. 
 Am I upset with how my dad was treated in the family? Of course. I mean, I was 16 when he died. And no -- nobody in the family made an effort to compensate for that in any way. So, that was hard. 
 I'm not entirely sure one wouldn't be upset that her uncles and aunts, who were also her trustees, misrepresented things. So, the financial arrangement we reached was essentially fraudulent. I think anybody would be upset about that. 
 But, as I have said, it -- this is not a vendetta. This is not revenge. This is not a settling of scores. If Donald had continued to be a private citizen, we wouldn't be having this conversation. 
 There -- you know, you have seen what's been going on with COVID-19. You have seen what's been going on with racial strife in this country. The problems are getting exacerbated every day. We are in serious trouble here. 
 And a large part of that is because Donald is incapable of leading. And he's being enabled by people who apparently are only interested in using him towards their own ends. And I'm afraid that those ends are not the best interests of this country. 
CUOMO: One of the things that is most interesting to me about you, as the writer, is, of course, everybody will seize upon the fact that you're family, and that you know this man. 
 M. TRUMP: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
CUOMO: And, yes, that's interesting to me. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: But more interesting to me is that, you are family, you know this man, and you are a clinician. 
 I get suggestions all the time from people who are in the therapeutic community. They're in the -- they're psychologists. They're really well-pedigreed people. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: I never have them come on the show and talk about the president because they don't know him. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: They don't have access to him. They don't have access to people around him. Purely speculating. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: You're different. You're a clinician who actually knows the person that we're talking about. 
 M. TRUMP: Mm-hmm. 
CUOMO: When you look at him through that lens of psychology, and how you would frame this individual, what would that diagnosis be? What would that insight be? How would you describe him in psychological terms? 
 M. TRUMP: You know, I don't directly diagnose him in the book, because, as I said earlier, there is a point at which it's irrelevant. 
 We need to deal with the problems that are being caused by his behaviors. 
CUOMO: Yes, except one thing, Mary. I agree with you. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: You're making a larger, more virtuous point than I am. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: But I'm thinking politics. 
 M. TRUMP: Sure. 
CUOMO: And you're thinking humanity. 
 M. TRUMP: Mm-hmm. 
CUOMO: In politics, understanding a person is fundamental to a voter. They will go over -- to feel over fact nine times out of 10. 
 I just -- I just like Mary's face better than Cuomo's. I just like the sound of her voice. She just seems smarter than he does. And it doesn't matter all those things happen to be true. But even if they weren't true, in politics, it matters. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: The president benefits greatly from traits of his being ascribed as strengths, when, to me, they scream out as weaknesses. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: You know who he is at his core when there is no camera around and the people who have been around him in his formative stages. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: Give some context to me about what that means to you, as a clinician. 
 M. TRUMP: The simplest way I could put it, which may be one of the more effective ways to put it, is that Donald is a psychologically deeply damaged man, based on his upbringing and the situation with his parents. 
 He is not going to get better. And he is, without question, going to get worse. 
CUOMO: Why is he going to get worse? He's already in his 70s. Isn't he kind of fully cooked? 
 M. TRUMP: Well, it depends on what you mean. In terms of his character, yes, his habits, yes, because I don't think he's interested in changing them. 
 But, no, I mean, illnesses, untreated, deteriorate over time. So... 
CUOMO: So, not just damage. You think he's got sickness? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, I do. 
 And I think a lot of people have diagnosed him, and I -- without knowing him personally, but there -- there is plenty of evidence to support some of those diagnoses. 
 And he's untreated. He's not interested in being treated. He has no insight. He has no psychological awareness of his situation. And, again, one of the most devastating things is that people who claim to care for him aren't helping him. 
 If they truly cared for him, the last place in the world they would want him to be is the Oval Office. And yet they do nothing. 
CUOMO: The clinicians always use the term narcissist, but can't that apply to just about anybody and anything? 
 Why do you think that attaches to him? 
 M. TRUMP: Well, there's -- there's the colloquial sense in which we mean narcissism, which is just sort of full of oneself. 
CUOMO: I mean, he's a politician. You know what I mean? He's president of the United States. You rarely meet them where they're all about everybody else all the time. 
 M. TRUMP: Sure, but... 
CUOMO: Their profession is kind of everything going through them. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, of course. 
 But he didn't become this way for -- well, whenever he started being a politician, I'm not really -- I'm not really sure, because he's run for president many times. But he's been this way since he was a teenager, at least. So, it's not -- it's not as if there's new evidence to support the diagnosis. 
 But, again, I think that, when you're looking at somebody's pathologies, it's not just how they come across. It's also how it affects them and their day-to-day functioning. 
 So, although, again, that -- that's also hard to sass out, because he's, as I say in the book, institutionalized to some degree. He's protected by the fact that he doesn't really need to live in or support himself in the real world. 
CUOMO: And how does that change the analysis for you? 
 M. TRUMP: It just makes it very difficult to see how his functioning is affected, because the context in which he's functioning is so small. 
 He doesn't have to negotiate the real world, like the rest of us do. And, quite honestly, he hasn't -- he never really has had to. He's gone from my grandparents' house, to my grandfather's business, to Trump -- the Trump Organization, to the Oval Office. 
 And those have all been fairly contained, controlled environments, in which his needs have been entirely taken care of by other people. 
 (END VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: Look, it's just tremendous insight into a family. And we are how we're raised, right? And we're seeing that in real time now. 
 So, what concerns Mary Trump most about her uncle less than four months out from Election Day? 
 Our conversation continues. You're going to want to hear it next. 
 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
CUOMO: So, why now? Why not during the campaign? 
 It's a big question, right, about why the timing of Mary Trump's book, going public with this blistering account of what he is in a way that nobody else could really tell us until now. 
 So, what's her answer? Here it is. 
 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: What is your biggest concern? 
 M. TRUMP: That he be allowed to continue unfettered throughout this extraordinary confluence of crises we're facing at the moment, and that do not seem at all to be improving, and, in fact, every day seem to be getting worse. 
 It's very, very concerning. And I truly hope that the American people see it that way and make the right choice when we're able to make that choice in November. 
CUOMO: Is it hard for you to say this about your uncle? 
 M. TRUMP: It's not -- it's not something I -- let's put it this way. 
 It's -- I wish I didn't have to. But somebody's got to say it. And I believe that I'm the only person in my family who is willing to. And I'm one of the few people who has the insight in order to be able to. 
CUOMO: How do they feel about what you did? 
 M. TRUMP: I don't know. I haven't spoken to anybody. 
 I can only speculate. Based on Donald's statement, I would guess they're not happy about it. But I... 
CUOMO: Well, there was the lawsuit to try to stop the book. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: That was brought by your other uncle, not by the president. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: But do you believe the president was aware of the legal effort and in favor of it? 
 M. TRUMP: Oh, I believe he was the driving force behind it. 
CUOMO: They just had somebody else carry the ball? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. And that's exactly what happened 20 years ago. 
CUOMO: Now, that's important. 
 So, it's not fair to you to say, yes, they're not talking to you now because they're mad because you just pissed off the whole family by writing a book. You had already had a major break with the family 20 years ago. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: So, are you in -- so, when you say, ""I'm the only one who would do it,"" is that because you share an opinion about Donald Trump that the rest of your family doesn't? 
 M. TRUMP: I think, most importantly, it's because I'm not afraid of him, and I don't feel loyalty in a way they may, because I believe that loyalty is a two-way street, and I don't see the benefit in pledging loyalty to somebody who would never pledge a loyalty to me. 
 So, I'm unhindered by either of those considerations. But, much more importantly, that's not enough of a reason to be doing this. It simply means that I'm free to. The reason to do it is because of the incredible, seemingly out-of-control crisis we're in the midst of. 
CUOMO: Why didn't you do it when he was running? 
 M. TRUMP: I really -- I thought about it. I thought about it long and hard. 
 But there were three crucial reasons. One is, there was absolutely no reason for me to think it would make a difference. There's a concept called learned helplessness, and it runs very deep in my family, when you just sort of feel trapped by circumstances, and no sense of empowerment at all or sense that anything you do would matter. 
 So, there was that. Also, in the... 
 (CROSSTALK) 
CUOMO: So, what changed about that? 
 M. TRUMP: Well, most importantly, what changed is that, thanks to Susanne Craig and -- who -- without whom none of this would have happened, and Russ Buettner, I finally had something concrete. 
 Before the election, it would have been my opinion, my assessment, my complaining, my being bitter, wanting revenge, what have you. 
 After ""The New York Times"" article, like, I had solid proof that there was something concretely wrong with his behavior and things he had done. And that made an extraordinary difference in, not my willingness, certainly, but my ability to feel like I could make a difference. 
CUOMO: What does it mean to you that there is a good chance that his base will disregard the book completely? 
 I know it's selling like crazy, but there are plenty of people in this country who have an appetite, an insatiable appetite... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: ... for negative things about the president. 
 M. TRUMP: Sure. 
CUOMO: But his base will likely dismiss it. What does that tell you about the power that your uncle does have over people? 
 M. TRUMP: You know, I think that base exists regardless of who's in the White House. And I never thought for a second that I could sway any of those people's opinions. 
 I mean, after everything this country has gone through, if Charlottesville didn't change their minds, if kids being kidnapped from their parents and caged on the border didn't change their minds, I mean, the list is endless and could go on -- and now we look at the fact that tens of thousands of people are dying because there's no federal leadership, and people aren't being asked to do the most simple thing to save their lives and the lives of other Americans. 
 I -- there's absolutely nothing I could say that would change their minds. 
CUOMO: The idea that, when the stuff happened at the border, not the wall stuff -- that was an obvious and easy political play for your uncle. 
 (CROSSTALK) 
 M. TRUMP: Right. Right. 
CUOMO: The kids in the cages, he said he didn't like it. He said it would stop. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: And then we wound up reporting out information that they were doing just the opposite. 
 And that messed with my theory that he knows better and that there is a human being in there, which means there is somebody in there who has compassion. It's just selective to his own interests. 
 But then I read your book, and you say, no, no, no, I remember the guy dropping the N-word in my house. So, this is a guy who's had bigoted feelings. 
 I had given him the benefit of the doubt that he was a demagogue, but not a bigot. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: You are saying, no, you have heard him use language and express ideas that are bigoted, period? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. Oh, yes. 
 And, to me, that's one of the least surprising things here. You know, and, to be frank about it, what's worse? He is endangering through his rhetoric and through his actions the lives of African Americans in this country every day. 
 He's using... 
CUOMO: And you think he does so with animus, that he has a problem with black people? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
 Also, he thinks it will work with his base. It's operating on both levels. 
CUOMO: But you believe it's in his heart as well? It's not just in his head, as, I need these people to vote for me, let me just say what I want them to say? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, it's not just a tactic. That's true, yes. 
CUOMO: And how did that go over in the family, that kind of talk? Was that just the vibe within the Trump household? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, look, you -- you grew up in Queens. 
 You know there were some neighborhoods, Jamaica Estates being one of them, it was like 100 percent white, and probably, up until the '60s, 100 percent Christian. There was no tolerance for difference. 
 When the first Italian American family moved into the neighborhood, it was a scandal, and my grandfather was horrified by it. So, yes, it was just -- it was the atmosphere in which we grew up. 
CUOMO: That's why we were all over in Holliswood, across 188th Street. 
 M. TRUMP: That's right. And that's why I'm... 
CUOMO: That's where all the Italians... 
 (CROSSTALK) 
 M. TRUMP: Right. And I'm -- that's why I'm extremely grateful I grew up in Jamaica, which was a world away from Jamaica States. 
CUOMO: So, you're not surprised that he has taken these, whether it's Charlottesville, or what's going on with Black Lives Matter. That's not just political opportunism. You are saying, no, the guy's a racist. He has a problem with them. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. Yes. 
 And what is -- the only thing that's shocking is how many people don't think that that's a line they can't cross. It so disturbing. 
CUOMO: And there were stories about him when we were investigating him years ago about his net worth, that he had the same kinds of prejudices about Jewish people as well, that that's who had to count his money... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: .. and notions like that, that we had largely dismissed, because we felt like that can't be true. 
 But you're saying, no, there's a character flaw in there. 
 M. TRUMP: I'm saying that it was perfectly acceptable in my family, starting with my grandfather, to have those ideas about difference. 
 It wasn't tolerated, it wasn't -- it wasn't valued, and it certainly wasn't respected. 
CUOMO: Now, to the extent that you can be wrong, you can't be wrong about something that's your opinion, because it's how you feel. 
 M. TRUMP: Right. 
CUOMO: One of the things that made headlines is, you say you were told very often a story about him cheating on his SATs, having somebody else take them. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: The man in question, Mr. Shapiro, passed away, I think, in 1999. His -- his -- is that wrong? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, because I don't believe that's the Joe Shapiro we're talking about. There's no way to know that. 
CUOMO: Ah, so it's someone else, because he has a widow named Pam Shriver. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes, Pam Shriver. 
CUOMO: And she says, it can't be him, because they didn't meet until they were in college. 
 You're saying wrong Shapiro? 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
 And I feel awful that Pam Shriver has had to be bombarded with this question, because, if you look at the timeline, yes, it's impossible. They met at Penn. Donald needed someone to take the SATs when he was at Fordham in order to get into Penn. 
 And the other thing that's been dismissed is the fact that, in New York City, the name Joe Shapiro isn't exactly unique. 
CUOMO: Fair point. 
 But the inability to prove it... 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: ... why is that not a discounting factor for you? 
 M. TRUMP: Well, it was a story I have been told. 
 And, like any other family, you know, stories are passed down. And that's why, even though I wasn't there at the time, you know, I can vouch for it, because I trust my source, who was somebody close to Donald. 
 I have no reason to make that story up. The book would have been just fine without it. But it does speak to his character, and that this has been part of his character all along, or at least since he was a teenager. 
 So, I think it's time to start asking my family that question directly. 
CUOMO: Are his followers coming after you? 
 M. TRUMP: No. No, not so far. 
CUOMO: Hope -- I hope that continues. 
 M. TRUMP: Thank you. 
CUOMO: Mark Meadows is now the chief of staff. 
 He was a longtime congressman, obviously. He says: The racist thing, that can't be. I have been around him for years. I have never heard him use that language. 
 Your response? 
 M. TRUMP: I -- that's so unlikely, that I find it difficult to take at face value. 
 I'm not entirely sure why Mark Meadows would say anything other than that. But I don't... 
CUOMO: If he wants his job, I don't know why he would either. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. Well, of course. 
CUOMO: Last question. 
 If you could speak directly to your uncle, what would you say? 
 M. TRUMP: He needs to resign. 
 It's time. It's -- it's -- in addition to being terrible for the country, it's bad for him. He needs to step down and let us start the very difficult work ahead of us of trying to right the wrongs and reestablish or reconnect to who we want to be going forward. And we cannot do that with Donald in the Oval Office. 
CUOMO: When he says, but they love me, I had 60-something million people vote for me, it's just the Democrats and the media trying to kill me, but the silent majority is for me, Mary. 
 M. TRUMP: Yes. 
CUOMO: I'm like the biggest thing ever in the Republican Party. 
 M. TRUMP: Well, let's just say, for the sake of argument, that 2016 was an anomaly in all sorts of ways, and we can't really litigate that at the moment. 
 But, right now, it seems pretty obvious that people are not showing him the real polls. You know they're not being straight with him about his performance in head-to-heads with Joe Biden in certain swing states. And he's being allowed to believe what he needs to believe. 
CUOMO: Mary Trump, I have to say that this is a -- everything about this administration has been highly unorthodox. 
 And the kind of insight coming from somebody who does the kind of work you do about the character and nature of the president of the United States is truly a unique offering. 
 I appreciate you doing it. I'm sure that this isn't easy. I'm sure it's not going to be easy going forward. But I appreciate you taking the time to discuss your experience and your book with us. 
 M. TRUMP: Chris, thank you so much. This was really great. Thank you. 
 (END VIDEOTAPE) 
CUOMO: A remarkably candid Mary Trump, who just has a very tough basis of experience to match.

[*]NADLER: The House Committee on the Judiciary will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recesses of the committee at any time. 
We welcome everyone to this afternoon's hearing on diversity in America, representation of people of color in the media. Before we begin, I would like to remind members that we have established an email address and distribution list dedicated to circulating exhibits, motions, or other written materials that members might want to offer as part of our hearing today. If you would like to submit materials, please send them to the email address that has been previously distributed to your offices, and we will circulate the materials to members and staff as quickly as we can. 
I would also remind all members that guidance from the Office of Attending Physician states that face coverings are required at all time--at all meetings and in enclosed space such as committee meetings. Everybody attending this hearing is required to follow this guidance except while speaking, and I will not recognize members to speak or not in compliance with these rules. If you do not wish to put on a mask, you have the option to participate in this hearing remotely. 
Finally, I would ask all members, both those in person and those appearing remotely, to mute your microphones when you are not speaking. This will help prevent feedback and other technical issues. You may unmute yourself anytime you seek recognition. 
I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. In recent months, our country has engaged in a much-needed reflection on the role that race and ethnicity play in our society. This reckoning is echoing in the halls of Congress, in our streets, and in boardrooms. As with so many industries across the country, it has also generated self-reflection in the entertainment industry. 
Today the committee continues its examination of race in America with a focus on the representation of people of color in the media. I am fortunate to represent a district that touches nearly every aspect of the entertainment industry in some way. I have seen firsthand the many economic and cultural benefits that the performing arts deliver to communities across the country, and I hope that today's discussion will help further our shared goal of fully representing the rich diversity of American society, both on-screen and behind the camera. 
The media plays a particularly important role in our society. Movies, television and, increasingly, content available through streaming services are the mediums by which Americans are inspired and entertained. Motion pictures and television programs are also the means by which Americans are exposed ideas and representations of life different from their own. 
When the entertainment industry has diverse facts in front of--has diverse faces in front of the camera, the viewing public sees stories that resonate with their lives and understands that these stories and experiences are valued and appreciated. It is important, however, that we are also mindful of the power that visual media has to reinforce negative images of racial and ethnic minorities when there is no in--when there is inadequate representation. 
To be clear, it would be wrong to draw a direct connection between art as portrayed on-screen and the racial divide that is reflected in society. After 250 years of slavery, 100 more years of Jim Crow, and 50 more years and counting of structural racism in our country, there is plenty of blame to go around and plenty of work to be done in all levels of government, in the boardrooms, in our schools, and in our criminal justice system. And there is no doubt that the divisive rhetoric and fear mongering that emanates from the White House every day is making things worse, not better. 
But without accurate representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, negative stereotypes and tropes may be perpetuated in society, which could ultimately lead to dehumanization and demonization. Unfortunately, studies that have reviewed diversity in the media highlight the challenges we face. 
In 2019, people of color accounted for only 27 percent of actors in lead roles in nearly 150 major films. While this number has almost tripled from 10.5 percent in 2011, representing a significant improvement on the part of the industry, it does not match the 40 percent that minorities represent in the U.S. population overall, which should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling. 
The entertainment industry can and should do better. Talent has no race or gender. Creativity is a gift that, when matched with hard work, can lead to enormous economic and social impacts. It is incumbent on the entertainment industry to ensure that opportunities are afforded to all who wish to pursue their talents. 
Studies show that the best way to improve representation in front of the camera is to have diversity behind the camera, and sufficient diversity is lacking offscreen as well. Ultimately, it is the directors, writers, producers, and executives who determine what stories are told and who is featured in these stories. The lack of adequate minority representation is an industrywide phenomenon, and there should be a collective effort to make improvements. 
I appreciate that the industry is aware of the problem and that it has focused on fixing it. A number of industry leaders and groups are working together to address basic pipeline problems, and they are also focused on further divis--diversifying the industry. 
For example, just earlier this month in a positive development, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced new criteria that will require, beginning in 2024, that films hoping to qualify for the best picture Oscars category meet specific diversity standards in front of and behind the camera. Hopefully, these actions by the academy will help set a standard going forward, and for all films to prioritize diversity throughout all aspects of the production. 
I recognize that our discussion today comes at a time when the entertainment industry is facing an existential threat, COVID-19, which is challenging and threatening every element of its business. This disease has had a devastating economic impact across the nation, not to mention the human toll of hundreds of thousands of lives lost. 
Within the entertainment industry, it has shut down theater productions in my district indefinitely, and it has dramatically curtailed film productions throughout the country. It is impacting all those who work in the motion picture industry. Of particular concern, the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on people of color who work in the industry and who do not have jobs that can be easily transposed to a laptop. 
Moreover, the pandemic is particularly impacting people of color who are women, LGBTQ, and/or disabled. Their already limited participation in jobs in the film industry has been hampered now even more. 
As I have made clear throughout this crisis, I am committed to working in partnership with the entertainment industry to ensure that its economic revival is stronger than ever. As productions returned to work, however, I hope the industry will take the opportunity to renew its commitment to diversity on-screen and off. 
I want to thank the Congressional Tri-Caucus, Hispanic Caucus, the Black Caucus, and the Asian Pacific American Caucus for their leadership in bringing attention to this important issue and for spurring action to address it. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about their personal experiences and about how we can best move forward together. 
I now recognize the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Jordan, for his opening statement. 
JORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Even the media is not woke enough for the Democrats. Hollywood is not woke enough for the Democrats. 96 percent of media, their political contributions in 2016 went to Democrats, almost all of Hollywood. We're going to have a--hear from a witness today that'll talk about this. Almost all of Hollywood supports the Democrats, but that's not good enough. 
This hearing proves no one, no one is safe from the cancel culture, no one is safe from the mob. They will--they will come after you. Look no further than Bari Weiss, former editor at the New York Times, who had to resign--had to resign because she was engaged in, as she said in her piece when she resigned, wrong think. Bari Weiss said this. She said this in that resignation letter. You say something the mob doesn't like, get ready for ""the digital thunderdome."" I couldn't--I don't know anyone who could say it better than that. 
That's what happens. You disagree with the mob, they come after you. They'll come after you, and their goal is--their goal is silence. Recent surveys, 62 percent of Americans say they're afraid to freely express themselves. This is the Judiciary Committee. We should remember this. You don't have for--a First Amendment when people are afraid to speak. You don't have free speech when only one side is allowed to talk. 
Think about the sports world, a subject one of our witnesses knows little bit about. Drew Brees says stand for the anthem. Oh, my goodness, did he get attacked. James Harden wears a mask that says back the blue, appropriate thing to do, frankly something that should have been mentioned at the outset of this hearing. Last night, two officers were shot. This is the second full hearing we've had following a--a tragedy were officers were attacked. The chairman says nothing. We should be thinking and praying for those families. James Harden wears back the blue mask, he gets attacked. 
My--my--my favorite, this is--this is how crazy the mob gets. Mike Gundy, football coach at Oklahoma State, 15 year coach, played at Oklahoma State, goes fishing with his kids, fishing with his family and wears the wrong T-shirt according to the mob, wears a T-shirt that has a conservative news outlet on the front, the name of one. Oh, my goodness, how dare he do that. For all we know, he picked the top T-shirt on the pile that--he's going fishing with his family. He almost lost his job for fishing in the wrong T-shirt. That is what the mob will do. 
The mob never stops. Political correctness has no end. And now the Democrats--the Democrats are pursuing this so much they're even going after their best friends in the world, the media and Hollywood. 2019--this gets bigger. Speaking of Hollywood, 2019, China pressured the film industry to remove images of the Japanese and Taiwanese flags from a trailer for the Top Gun sequel. 
MGM, involved with a remake of the film Red Dawn, altered the identities of the invading military. I'm so old I remember the first one where it was the Soviet Union. They--this is--and they did this postproduction. So, no, no, no, it can't be an invading military from China. It's got to be North Korea. Attorney general has pointed out that many scripts likely never see the light of day because writers and producers know that they can't even test the limits. They're going to be attacked again by the mob and today, obviously, by the Democrats. 
But this isn't the worst. This isn't of the worst of it. Silence is not enough for the mob. And this is the--this is the scariest part. It's not enough that you be quiet. It's not enough that you can't exercise your free speech rights, your First Amendment liberties. That's not enough. They want you to agree with them. They want to force you to agree with them. 
You don't believe me? Go watch the videotape. Come into a restaurant, harass you if you don't raise your fist, harass you if you don't bend your knee. This is scary. And the idea that we're--that we're--this committee is having a hearing to foster more of it instead of to speak out against it is even more scary. 
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. I hope the Judiciary Committee with--as I've said so many times, the storied history of protecting the Constitution, the rule of law, and the Bill of Rights will say this has got to stop. This is got to stop. 
And frankly, you all had a chance. A few weeks ago--eight weeks ago when the attorney general was here, he asked the chairman and the Democrats on this committee why won't you speak out against the violence? Why won't you speak out against the mob? And guess what he got? Total silence. 
Let's speak out now. Let's speak out now. Let's say the First Amendment is sacrosanct. Let's say you--what's going on is wrong, plain wrong. And I think--well, certainly 62 percent of Americans understand it. It's wrong and we shouldn't be promoting it. I yield back. 
NADLER: The gentleman yields back. Without objection, all other opening statements will be included in the record. 
I will now introduce today's witnesses. Erika Alexander is an actress, writer, director, producer, and entrepreneur. She is also the cofounder of Color Farm Media, an entertainment, innovation, and social impact company. 
Edward James Olmos is an Emmy award-winning actor, producer, and director who has appeared in a number of films and television shows throughout his distinguished career. 
Daniel Dae Kim is an actor, producer, and director. He's also founder and CEO of the 3AD Media, a production company. 
Joy Villa is a songwriter, a recording artist, actress, and author who has toured the world extensively performing music. 
Jason Whitlock is a sportswriter, TV personality, radio host, and podcaster currently working at Outkick, a sports and culture website. He previously worked at the Kansas City Star and Fox Sports, and founded ESPN's website, The Undefeated. 
Dr. Stacy Smith is an associate professor of communications and the founder and director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. She received her PhD from the University of California Santa Barbara. 
Karyn Temple is Senior Executive Vice President and Global General Counsel at the Motion Picture Association. Prior to joining MPA, she served more than eight years in the U.S. Copyright Office, most recently as the Register of Copyrights. She received her BA from the University of Michigan and her JD from Columbia University School of Law, a wonderful school in my district. 
We welcome all of our distinguished witnesses and we thank them for their--for their participation. Now, if you would please rise, I would begin by swearing you in. Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you're about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge, information, and belief, so help you God? 
UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) 
NADLER: Let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated. 
Please note that each of your written statements will be entered into the record in its entirety. Accordingly, I asked that you summarize your testimony in five minutes. To help you stay within that time, there is a timing light on the witness table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you have one minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns red, it signals your five minutes have expired. For our witnesses appearing virtually, there is a timer on your screen to help you keep track of time. 
Mr. Alexander--Ms. Alex--I want to note that we are joined in the room by Representative Castro, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who has been a leader in the issues we are discussing today. 
Ms.--Ms. Alexander, you may begin. 
ALEXANDER: Thank you. I've been a card-carrying union member and professional in show business for 37 years, so I'm uniquely qualified to have this discussion. I'll also talk about the core tenet that guides my life and progress, that representation matters and how one character can impact the lives and psychology of today's viewers. I'll address the big picture and, like Deep Throat, I'll tell you to follow the money. 
Now, I'm a girl from Flagstaff, Arizona. My mother was a teacher. My father was an itinerant preacher. They were both orphans. They had six kids. We lived in the Twilight Hotel, two bedroom shack off of Route 66. 
Perhaps some of you know me from my television/film work on the Cosby Show, Living Single, and Get Out. I'm a two time NAACP best actress winner, and I've done six plays at the Public Theater in New York City. You may know me as the producer of the recent John Lewis documentary, Good Trouble. I'm proud to be a working actor, proud to have made my living in entertainment, but I'm one of the lucky ones. 
For too long, people of color, women, LGBTQ people, people with disabilities, were not represented in the mainstream media. And if they were, it was through harmful stereotypes. Media images have power, power to shape opinion and lives for good or ill. I know firsthand that representation matters because of what I call the Maxine Shaw effect. 
The character of Maxine Shaw, the lawyer that I portrayed on the hit television series Living Single, has inspired thousands of people to pursue education and careers in law and politics. The character even inspired Stacy Abrams and your esteemed colleague, Congress one--Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. 
Maxine Shaw, a groundbreaking fictional black character, inspired trailblazing real-life black achievers. And when we say representation matters, we don't just mean on-screen, but behind the camera, in the trades, in the departments, and most importantly in the room where it happens, where decisions are made. 
Let's talk about the big picture for a second. I've seen and experienced structural racism and discrimination that is part of the unwritten fabric of Hollywood. When a television show can have only so many black characters be--before it becomes a black show and is relegated to the cultural ghetto, that's structural racism. 
When executives presumed prejudices lead to the casting of only white or light skinned black actresses in shows or films that need to make part of their profit overseas, that's structural racism, even though we live in an increasingly diverse world. 
Here's my experience as a dark skinned black actress. Certain doors would never be open to me, no matter my accomplishments. When I was young, I would never be cast as an ingenue like my white age peers. When I starred for five years on the network comedy Living Single, my pay and that of my costars was only a small fraction of what our white counterparts were making on Friends from the same studio. 
My friend Viola Davis put it well in 2008 interview with Porter magazine. ""If Caucasian women were getting 50 percent of what men--white men were being paid, we're not even getting a quarter of what white women are getting paid."" Frustrated with the opportunities available, I expanded my skill set and taught myself how to write and to create my own entertainment properties, but here too I encountered structural racism. 
I created a science fiction film and pitched it around town. I was dismayed and disheartened when a white male studio head told me I was wasting my time, that black people don't like science fiction because they don't see themselves in the future. He's saying this to me, a daughter of the people who created jazz, rock 'n roll, hip-hop. We are the original futurists in American culture, but this well-paid white gatekeeper was telling me he knew better. 
And I meet those same people in talent agencies and management companies that set the tone for the town and set the value and price of my work. If you want to see what and who Hollywood values, follow the money. Yes, there's been some change. Yes, Black Panther, Hamilton, and Crazy Rich Asians made a lot of money. Talk about one of the lucky ones. 
But for every extraordinary exception like that, there are hundreds more mediocre films with white casts that get green lit, filmed, marketed, and awarded each year. A lack of diversity in the executive suite leads to this ongoing pandemic of exclusion on the cultural stage. 
I would suggest to remedy this state of affairs, well, the one super villain Black Panther would not defeat is the racist infrastructure of this industry. So, the hero we need is us, we the people. And to address this complex issue, it will take more than a village. It will take a nation. The government should incentivize companies to support and fund marginalized content creators. 
Though artists and entertainers have been vilified as everything from radicals to spoiled babies, what we really are is small businesspeople who make America's number one export and key to our soft power in the world, entertainment. I say support minority small businesses, what we've done. 
I created Color Farm Media, a company dedicated to finding new voices. We call ourselves the Motown of film, television, and tech. Our goal is to re-band blackness. It's why we made the John Lewis documentary, Good Trouble, why I'm making a film about the legendary Boys Choir of Harlem, and why I'm directing a documentary about reparations. 
The seeds of the future are planted in the stories of today. If only certain stories are told, only certain lives matter. Going forward, diversity and true representation in our stories, in our entertainment, will ensure that black lives matter too. Thank you very much. 
NADLER: Thank you. Mr. Olmos? Mr. Olmos, you may want to unmute. 
OLMOS: I'm on mute. I'm waiting for the video. 
NADLER: You--you've got it. You're okay now. 
OLMOS: Yes. Can you please play the video? 
NADLER: Oh. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
OLMOS: Film influences the human mind. It's a very powerful medium. 
GARCIA: The way you address diversity is by going back to the drawing board and starting in fourth grade. 
AGUSTIN: The mission of the Youth Cinema Project is very simple. It's about closing the achievement gap in the classroom for our most underprivileged children and to close the opportunity gap in the entertainment industry for our communities of color. 
UNKNOWN: Scene five, Cat, take two. 
KING: The program involves two filmmaking mentors going into the classroom. And they teach the entire process of film, so how to generate ideas, how to write the script, all the planning and preproduction, filming itself in production as well as post. They go to the process, treating the students of colleagues rather than lecturing to them. 
UNKNOWN: Action. 
UNKNOWN: Get in the car. 
UNKNOWN: No, please. 
UNKNOWN: Cut. 
OLMOS: It's inspired the community to the point of where kids are actually attending school more. 
MILLER: We talk about project-based learning. So, rather than just taking a book and talking about a particular set of concepts in the book, it's--it's got a practical application. 
UNKNOWN: I've learned to not be shy and to believe in myself and to never give up. 
UNKNOWN: The biggest thing I learned in this program was to collaborate with others who express themselves. 
MILLER: I think it's just a different way to approach learning. 
GARCIA: This is the only program I know that brings an industry, in this case entertainment industry, into the classroom, into the school site, into the district. 
OLMOS: Creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration, all those values are so much a part of filmmaking. 
GARCIA: We create lifelong learners and lifelong problem solvers. This is the only program I know where teachers, principals, superintendents, and board members are saying this gets 100 percent engagement. 
UNKNOWN: I think this program should be around again. There's other programs, it's more like with the board and you're just going to learn this. And here in film, you actually got to mess around with equipment. 
UNKNOWN: Quiet on set. Sound? 
UNKNOWN: Speed. 
UNKNOWN: Camera? 
UNKNOWN: Rolling. 
UNKNOWN: Day one, scene two, take three, mark. 
UNKNOWN: Action. 
UNKNOWN: Why are you here? 
UNKNOWN: Same reason you are. 
UNKNOWN: George, get back here. 
OLMOS: I mean, I wish I would have been--had this class when I was in the fourth grade. My work would have been completely different. 
AGUSTIN: Our ultimate goal is to try to get the Youth Cinema Project inside every fourth grade class throughout the United States. 
OLMOS: I am the founder and the creator of the Youth Cinema Project, and I'm very honored and proud of it. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
OLMOS: Self-esteem, self-respect, and self-worth is what we're talking about here today. I think Enasco (SP) said it best--Ionesco, I mean. It is not the answer that illuminates. It's the question. The question is diversity in America, the representation of people of color in the media. It still does not exist. 
You've got to remember we're talking about the single most important art form that humans have ever created. Nothing attacks the subconscious mind more. You sit down in front of a--a theater screen with the dark room and you sit with stereo sound around you with no peripheral vision, everything goes into the subconscious, everything, and it stays there. And I'll tell you right now, if you don't think it affects you, try going after seeing Jaws and jump in the water and the beach. 
Now, the situation is this. I played this because collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creativity is what makes us who we are and builds self-esteem, self-respect. So do the images that we see. Now, the problem with the United States film industry and the industry in general is that it has a habit of not allowing certain stories to be told because they don't make enough money, they say. But really in essence, they are trying to do things that are actually stifling the diversity in this country. 
For instance, go back to--I--I ask anybody in this room, especially you sitting at the--the Congressmen here, listen, name me one American of Mexican descent Medal of Honor winner that you have ever seen portrayed on the screen in the United States of America on a film. You can't. Why? Because there's never been one. The closest we ever got really was a Silver Star recipient, Guy Gumbaldo (SP)--Gabaldon; Jesus. 
All I can tell you is this. Guy, what he did, he brought in--in--inside--he was called the Pied Piper of Saipan. Now, what he did, he brought in 1,500 Japanese to surrender during the attack on Saipan. He brought them in by himself without any weapons. He talked them in and brought them in. He got a Silver Star. 
Now, the funny thing is that Sergeant Alvin York in World War I did 10 times less than what he did in bringing in surrendering enemy, and he got a Medal of Honor. You start to see what I'm talking about. But guess what? Guy Gabaldon movie was played and made in 1960. And the person who played him was Jeffrey Hunter. 
We got hit again just most recently with Argo, when one of our great, great heroes, CIA agent Tony Mendez, was portrayed. And guess what? No one even knew that he was Latino because the actor/director, and great actor, great director, decided that I guess he could get more money to make the movie if he used himself as the actor, even though I think the director and the fact that he was using one of the great, great scriptwriters ended up chained to him flat out. 
I mean, they ended up making this movie, and what ended up happening is they had the best film of the year. But why couldn't he have put in someone like Michael Pena, Andy Garcia, Jimmy Smits, Benjamin Bratt, one of the many, many great artists that we have, in the leading role and allowed that situation to happen? 
I gotta tell you right now, we have a future, and the future is in understanding that diversity is the key. And we're not doing it. 
NADLER: Thank you very much. We'll now hear from Daniel Dae Kim. 
KIM: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Mender--Member Jordan, and members of the Judiciary Committee. It is a pleasure to be here with you today. But to be honest, when I was approached to be a part of this hearing, I initially declined. I thought why do we need to have a hearing about the importance of diversity in media? 
It seems self-evident that, from its creation, America as we know it has been built on the principles of freedom, freedom of religion, freedom from tyranny, freedom of speech. In fact, the very words inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty echo with the resounding power of these ideas. Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores, send these, the homeless, tempest-tost, to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door! 
Now, these words signify freedom and safe harbor to all who have suffered regardless of from where they came. Nowhere does it specify that these ideals only apply to those who are white or male or Catholic or heterosexual. Almost by definition, they are an invitation to diversity, diversity of thought and diversity of people. 
So, I thought why would Congress need to hear from me on this subject? And then I remembered House Resolution 908, passed just this past Friday. I'm sure you guys recall it. It was a bill that simply asked to condemn and denounce anti-Asian sentiment, racism, discrimination, and religious intolerance related to COVID-19. 
To me, that was a no-brainer. Who wouldn't support condemning racism in 2020, a full 50 years after the civil rights movement? But as I looked at the roll call, I saw that 164 representatives in the House voted against it. That's more than a third of the members of Congress, and more than 80 percent of the Republican members of the House, including some of you watching right now, that could not simply say that anti-Asian sentiment is wrong and should be condemned. 
Now, you may ask yourself what does anti-Asian sentiment have to do with representation and diversity in media. Well, as one of my favorite artists, Jenny Holzer says, all things are delicately interconnected. 
The media has always been a reflection of our values and culture. From the early days of television and the popular--popularity of shows like Dick Van Dyke, the Ed Sullivan Show, and Leave It to Beaver, we got a glimpse into what it meant to be American in the '50s. 
They were clean-cut times when the biggest problem for our hero was being the only boy invited to a girl's birthday party. Now, that's--that's an actual storyline, by the way. Now, one look at how different programming is today is a simple reminder of how much our society has changed. A show like Breaking Bad or Atlanta or Ramy would hardly make sense in the context of America in the '50s. 
Now, another way that our storytelling has changed is the perspective from which our stories are told. In the '60s, all we had to say was, look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, to know that our hero was coming to save the day, a hero that was inevitably white. In fact, he was so white that, even though he was actually an alien from the planet 27 light-years away, he was able to fool everyone into thinking he was actually from Kansas. 
But things are changing. And now one of the growing number of exceptions to that rule also happens to be America's highest grossing superhero film of all time, Black Panther, a film with African-American leads, African-American heroes. 
Rethinking the paradigm to encourage diversity is one of the primary reasons I created my own production company. I believe that we, as creators and producers, must work to create fully realized characters from all places and backgrounds and showcase them in stories where they can lead, be heroes, be complex or, in some cases, just be simple slice of like--slice of life folks like the Cleavers. 
It's my belief that the diversity that has made this country great can and should be reflected in our entertainment in front of and behind the camera. I do have a confession to make, though. Like Ranking Member Jordan, I can't wait for the day that we no longer have to have hearings like this about diversity. I can't wait for the day that people can say can you believe there was a time where people thought Latino am--all Latino Americans were illegal immigrants, or that all Muslims were terrorists, or that black lives didn't matter? 
Let's hope to have so many different portrayals of races that, as Martin Luther King so eloquently put it, people can be judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin. And I'd also add to that not who they love, not which God they worship, or what disability they may have. Perhaps then when a bill like 908 comes up, our elective representatives can unanimously show empathy and support for Asian Americans who, according to a recent report, have been victims of more than 2,800 acts of discrimination just since March. 
I look forward to the future when hate crimes and racism become nothing more than a relic from a shameful past. Proper representation in the media is one of the most powerful ways we can make that future a reality. Thank you. 
NADLER: Thank you. Ms. Villa? 
VILLA: Mr. Chairman, Ranking Members, and members of this committee, thank you for inviting me to speak. My name is Joy Villa. I'm a number one Billboard artist, actress, and conservative actress. I have lived with and dealt with this topic for my entire life. I've never taken a day off from being a woman of color. 
I'm the author of Kickass Conservative. I produced in and starred in a new film. I've toured over 35 countries. And I proudly support President Donald J. Trump and the sovereignty of the American people. 
I'm mixed-race. I'm black, Choctaw Native American on my mother's side. I'm Italian and Argentinean on my father's side. I'm extremely proud of my diverse background. I strongly believe in and have fought for diversity. Many of my peers in Hollywood and media proudly promote diversity of race, holly--background, heritage, sexuality, religion, and culture, as they should. 
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences wants to mandate diversity in the Oscars nomination process. This is wrong. I would like to be hired for the role because I'm the best person for the job, not because my color or gender checks a mandated box. That's tokenism. 
Until I came out as a Trump supporter by wearing a fabulous make America great again dress to the Grammys four years ago, I had never been blacklisted. Back in 2015, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel talked favorably with Kelly Osbourne about one of my red carpet gowns. This was before I was a conservative. In 2018, Ava DuVernay, the celebrated black filmmaker, who said she wants to use more black actresses in her films and have more diversity, blocked me on Twitter. 
I was blacklisted from industry events. I was not welcome on talk shows. I was not included in pop-culture magazines or publications unless as the butt of a joke. Rolling Stone magazine told my publicist they would not write about me because of my politics. One casting director called me that Trump bitch. 
I've been called a race traitor, an uncle Tom, Aunt Jemima, house nigger, slave, been told to go back to Africa, told to straighten my nappy hair, called a puta negra--it's black bitch--that I should be deported, and even worse, I've had threats against my life and my family's lives. 
These remarks come only from the so-called tolerant left, who preach that they want diversity. To be clear, this did not happen because I'm black or because I'm Latina or because I'm a woman. It happened because I'm openly conservative. 
Hollywood is a monopoly right now. There are six major studios and none, to my knowledge, are committed to diversity of thought. The big six are comprised of motion--motion picture conglomerates 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and Walt Disney Studios. And they account for over 83 percent of the North American market share, bringing in billions of dollars of revenue each year. 
What happened to me is discrimination. They don't like pro-Trumpers, pro-America, pro-life, or pro-God. They want to shut down, keep out, and crush any type of diversity because it makes them uncomfortable. They're taking that discomfort and actively, openly discriminating against people in the workplace. 
This hearing is meaningless and benign if it doesn't also address the active canceling of diverse voices going on right now. Yes, we need racial and ethnic diversity, and representation matters. But diversity is not only about color, gender, or how able-bodied someone is or isn't. 
We need to stop the discrimination against political affiliation. It's dangerous. It's destructive. It's grounded in emotion and fear, not facts. Just as we have protected classes in our country under federal law for race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, sexuality, and disability, it's time to include political affiliations. 
Congress has an opportunity to be a watchdog and to set the tone. I'm an American first and foremost. I'm proud of our country and I want to see it thrive. I want to see it protected for future generations as well. 
I implore Congress to act now by expanding the Civil Rights Act in--of 1964 to include political affiliation as a protected class. Media companies that agree in writing and not to discriminate based on political leanings could be offered certain advantages such as tax breaks. This is about protecting all Americans, no matter who they are, where they live, or what kind of work they do, and no matter how loud or quiet their voices are. 
The First Amendment gives us the freedom of association. I strongly believe that that includes the right to freely associate with the political party of one's choosing. Political bigotry is silencing the voices of Americans. Thank you. 
NADLER: Thank you. Mr. Whitlock? 
WHITLOCK: Good afternoon. I'd like to begin by thanking Representative Jim Jordan and his staff for the opportunity to speak today on a topic central to my life's work and mission, diversity in the media. 
My name is Jason Whitlock. I'm a partner and content creator at outkick.com, a media platform with the mission of creating a fearless culture in support of sports, masculinity, and free speech. Before taking an ownership stake at Outkick, I was a well-known sports columnist at the Kansas City Star and a personality and host at ESPN and Fox Sports. 
My written work has also been published that Playboy magazine, the Huffington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and at Fox News. In the last decade, I was involved in a journalism project, ESPN's The Undefeated, and a television project sports tall--Fox Sports's talk show, Speak for Yourself, designed to elevate, develop, and support black content creators. 
Today top--today's topic is not an issue I've paid lip service to. I've lived it. I'm humbled and honored to have a voice worthy of being heard before this audience at this time in American history. 
Thomas Jefferson rightly argued that he would rather have newspapers without government than government without newspapers. Jefferson made clear in our Declaration of Independence that he believed in the power of self-evident truth, and he knew that journalism was a primary tool to make truth self-evident. A journalistic search for truth forced America to deal with the founding principle Jefferson spelled out, all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator unalienable rights. 
A--today across this country, we hear protesters, rioters, and anarchists in our streets chanting no justice, no peace. They say they are doing this on behalf of black lives. They've aligned to justice with the threat of violence. Justice's true ally is truth, not war. Truth precedes justice. No truth, no justice. 
The racial justice that so many people say they are clamoring for cannot be won absent of truth. The healthy diversity that so many people say they want reflected in the media cannot be built on false narratives and outright lies. We are here today to discuss diversity and its ability to make our union more perfect. We can't get there without first discussing our abandonment of truth. No truth, no justice. 
What is standing in the way of truth and therefore standing in the way of holistic diversity? Big tech and Silicon Valley's hijacking of journalism. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube made race clickbait the gold standard of American journalism. They are the stewards of fake news. 
When I graduated from Ball State University in 1990, the journalism industry catered to New York liberalism. 30 years later, the industry caters to northern California radicalism and groupthink. Producing work that triggers algorithms that lead to likes, retweets, and follows is the mandate enforced by media executives. 
Social media has transformed the mainstream media, turning seekers of truth into seekers of influence. It's had the same impact on athletes. They are no longer role models. They're influence peddlers. Lebron James, a basketball prodigy with more than 80 million social media followers, has more influence over news coverage that any single journalist. He is our Walter Cronkite. Colin Kaepernick and athletes across professional sports have forced the NFL and NBA to promote the false narrative that there is a pandemic of police brutality sweeping America's black communities. Facts do not support this narrative. 
I say that having lost a cousin that I helped raise to what me and my family believe was an abuse of force by law enforcement in 2012. The outrage and pain that so many claim they feel over Breonna Taylor's tragic death in Louisville I know firsthand. A picture of my cousin sits in my living room. Every day I look at Anton Butler's face. Indianapolis sheriffs tasered him to death in the rain. There will be no justice for my cousin or anyone until the American media refocuses on a search for truth. 
And the truth is, as it relates to the mainstream media, the diversity we're lacking right now isn't racial. We lack the resolve to follow the truth wherever it leads. Big tech eliminated the search for truth. Big tech installed athlete celebrities and rigged ag--algorithms as journalists. The media has always leaned left. It's the disregard for truth that is killing America, though. Slapping black faces on Silicon Valley lies won't improve America. No truth, no justice. 
NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Whitlock. 
I want to note that we are in the middle of a--of the long series of votes on the floor. We wanted to start the hearing on time to respect the time of our witnesses, but I and the other members will be filtering in and out so that we can vote. Please do not take any offense if you see some of our members leaving the room. 
And we'll call on Dr. Smith now. 
SMITH: Mr. Chairman and members of the House Judiciary Committee, since 2005, I've conducted more than 50 studies on diversity and--and inclusion onscreen and behind the camera in entertainment. Much of my work has focused on identity groups that have been historically marginalized in the industry. Using this body of research, I will lu--illuminate here the exclusion of the BIPOC community in fictional films, whereas my written remarks include T.V. and streaming content. 
Three major claims can be made about the BIPOC community in film. First, progress has been paltry for BIPOC characters in feature films. Across 1300 top films from 2007 to 2019, only 17 percent of all leads and co-leads were from underrepresented racial ethnic groups. To illuminate the disconnect between Hollywood films and reality, only two movies depicted an Hispanic or Latino lead in 2019, despite the fact that 18.5 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic/Latino as are 21 percent of moviegoers. 
Moving from leading characters, speaking characters, only 34 percent of all speaking characters across a 100 top moviego--movies of 2019 were from an underrepresented racial ethnic group. However, no meaningful change--no meaningful change has been observed in the percentage of black, Latino, or Asian characters onscreen since 2007. 
The epidemic of invisibility onscreen, particularly for women of color is problematic. Across 100 movies last year, a full 33 erased black girls and women, 55 deleted Asian females. 71 movies were devoid of Hispanic/Latinas, 92 excised Middle Eastern, North African girls and women. Indigenous females were virtually missing every top movie. And to illustrate the breadth of exclusionary casting practices, 598 of the top 600 movies across the last six years did not show a single transgender woman of color onscreen. 
Besides invisibility, far too many roles played black, Latino, Asian, or MENA ill focus on crime and violence. This can perpetuate stereotyping, particularly among those who have little direct experience with individuals from these groups. 
The reason--the reason for these trends becomes apparent once you look behind the camera. The second major claim is that few BIPOC directors home top films. Across 1300 movies, people of color filled only 14 percent of all directing jobs. And the vast majority of these jobs were held by BIPOC men. Only 13 women of color have worked as directors across 1300 films. This translates into a ratio of 92 white male directors to every one woman of color. 
Why is inclusion behind the camera so important? Because BIPOC directors are more likely than their white counterparts to tell stories that feature underrepresented actors onscreen. And BIPOC crew are hired below the line. 
The third claim is that mythologizing drives hiring plac--practices. My qualitative has shown that industry decisionmakers perceive that BIPOC talent and stories are not a box office draw, however this myth is so far from reality. When a variety of production, distribution, and exhibition factors were statistically controlled across 1200 movies, the underrepresented status of leads and co-leads was positively associated with box office revenue in the U.S. What does this mean? BIPOC leads sell. 
Internationally, the underrepresented status of leads was not associated with box office performance, suggesting that international audiences are drawn to good stories with white or BIPOC protagonists. There are real consequences to this industry mythologizing. Production budgets and marketing resources for films starring BIPOC's leads are lower than those for white leads. 
Films starring women of color are particularly disadvantaged in terms of resource allocation. These results, along with the reality that underrepresented audiences, by 46 percent of the tickets at the box office demonstrate that biases detrimentally impact the lives and careers of BIPOC creatives. 
So, given these claims, what can be done? Entertainment companies must create and adopt inclusion policies immediately, setting target inclusion goals using objective and quantifiable criteria to eliminate bias hiring, and enacting these policies throughout their entire supply chain. These policies must be transparent so that consumers and stakeholders can hold them publicly accountable. 
Government intervention in the form of tax incentives reward inclusion, not just count it, are one way to improve participation of BIPOC communities in the production process. Last, providing increased governmental funding for storytelling is a crucial way to change this status quo. These and other solutions will ensure that qualified and talented individuals from all backgrounds receive opportunities and access throughout the entire entertainment industry. Thank you. 
SCANLON: Thank you very much. And now we'll hear from Karyn Temple. 
TEMPLE: Thank you, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Jordan, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify on behalf of the Motion Picture Association our member studios on the important issue of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the motion picture and television industry. 
Although I just recently joined the MPA as Global General Counsel, I have worked in and with the entertainment industry for most of my legal career. So the issue before the committee is not just an abstract position for me. It is one that I care about deeply and personally, as an African-American woman, mother, American citizen, and a human being. I grew up at a time when there were no mary--movie f--fairy tale princesses who looked like me, no leading franchise superheroes, no kids' T.V. series that reflected my reality. 
So I'm not here to sugarcoat things for you today. While our industry has made some significant progress--and I will highlight many of those initiatives for you--let me be clear. The entertainment industry still has a long way to go before we reflect the true diversity of this country, both in front of and behind the camera. From the top executives and A-list actors, to writers and producers on down to below the line crew, our industry, and the stories we tell, often do not represent the full spectrum of American society. That must change. 
The first step to actually solving any problem is to acknowledge and own it. So, I readily concede that there is a problem of diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. But today I'd like to focus on how we and our member studios have mobilized to fix it. 
We at the MPA are committed to great storytelling that reflects the viewpoints and experiences of all creators and audiences, which was why we are working hard with our member studios to collectively address diversity, gender parity, authentic cultural representation, and pipeline recruitment opportunities from underrepresented communities in our industry. By establishing programs that promote a diverse talent pipeline, creating new partnerships, and sharing what we learn, we are leading by example. 
Eight years ago we established our own Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program because our members proactively supported the MPA playing a constructive role in making sure our industry is open and welcoming to people of all backgrounds. We're proud of our track record since through our DE&I program, we have supported increasingly robust efforts by the industry to enhance the diversity of the creative pipeline, including via outreach to film schools and groups representing African-American, Latinx, Asian-American and Pacific Islander, Native American, women, and LGBTQ cre--creators. 
We're grateful for the opportunity to partner with many such organizations, including the Entertainment Industry College Outreach Program, the Georgia Latino Film Alliance, and the Ghetto Film School, a non-profit whose groundbreaking Roster Program trains 4,000 aspiring young creators annually for careers in creative industries, the vast majority of which are from underrepresented groups. 
And most recently, MPA was proud to announce a partnership with the Native American Media Alliance focused on promoting Native American writers in the entertainment industry. We also collaborate with many of the leading multicultural creative organizations and film festivals, including the American Black Film Festival, the Georgia Latino Film Festival, and the New York Latino Film Festival. 
Beginning in January of '19, we also proactively reached out to the Tri-Caucus to educate members about MPAs and our member studios' efforts, and to foster opportunities for Congress to hear directly from multicultural creator organizations working on the front lines of fostering change. Indeed, we've initiated many such important dialogues both in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. and continue to do so despite COVID-19. 
But of course, what matters most is what our member studios are doing in this area. I am gratified that today, there are movie fairytale princesses that look like girls in my community, television shows that feature dynamic, strong, black, Asian, and Hispanic girls, and movies with black superheroes that touch the world. We're proud that each studio in the MPA has its own robust corporate policies, senior-level diversity and inclusion-focused personnel, and other programs. 
Our members have established a large number of membership in other programs specifically designed to give members of underrepresented groups the necessary training and relationship-building necessary to gain a foothold in the industry. I'll refer you to my written testimony for most of the details, but I did want to just mention two examples. 
Sony Pictures Diverse Directors Program, which is now in its seventh year, has enabled the studio to identify emerging women and directors of color and has resulted numerous program alums actively directing for Sony Pictures and throughout the industry. The Walt Disney Company has many programs and policies to address these issues, including the U.S. Hispanic Initiative, a companywide effort focused on growing rel--relevancy to, and engagement with, U.S. Hispanics. And a longstanding Creative Talent Development program to diversify the creative pipeline that have helped launch the careers of many industry professionals, including Peter Murrieta and Zetna Fuentes. 
I want to thank the Committee for the opportunity to be part of the discussion on these important issues and we remain committed to working with you until our shared goals of a fully diverse, equitable, and inclusive motion picture and television industry becomes a reality. I welcome your questions. Thank you. 
SCANLON: Thank you to all of our witnesses. We'll now proceed under the five minute rule with questions and I'll recognize Ms. Lofgren for five minutes. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much and thanks to each and every one of our witnesses. You know, Hispanic Heritage Month is an appropriate time to be discussing underrepresentation in media, especially when the traditional home of (AUDIO GAP) California, my home, is almost 40 percent Hispanic. And even higher in Los Angeles, (AUDIO GAP) Hispanic and yet, that community only accounts for three percent directors and four percent of producers. 
Now, like all for profit businesses, movie and T.V. studios and other media companies are ultimately driven by their financial bottom line. (AUDIO GAP) short sighted to reflect biases. But, in the end, including racial and ethnic representation should be good business given the audience. And we've had some examples mentioned here by our witnesses today. 
So I'm struggling to understand why this economic imperative cannot be successful in moving Hollywood to a more--into more diversity. And I'm wondering--it was so wonderful to listen to you, Mr. Olmos, about why this matters. Sitting in the movie theater, having these things go directly into your consciousness. It matters who is represented and how people understand our society. And movies play such a role in that. Talk to me about why the bottom line hasn't moved us to where we need to be. Mr. Olmos. 
OLMOS: The bottom line comes to the understanding that they don't have to. If they put out a movie with a person that is ""Latino"" in a secondary role or third role, if we go to the theaters and we make up 32 to 37 percent of all the box office on opening weekend, we always put in a lot of money into the situation. I think in the future what's happening and what I presented when I presented the video, is that we have to turn around and understand that we have responsibility for ourselves. 
The only way it's going to change is if we change it. We need to have the writers; we need to have the in front of camera and behind the camera people organized and ready to go. That's why the Youth Cinema Project is way beyond anybody's imagination. Over the last six years, we have hit--we've actually put together over 1400 people, children in 13 different school districts to take this program twice a week for 90 minutes with two ambas--two mentors in the classroom. 
We are creating over 130 feature films or films by these students from fourth grade through high school, all the way through high school every year. We've produced more film than anyone. Now, I will tell you this, it will take another 10, 15 years, but it's going to change. And when it changes, these--these kids (AUDIO GAP) Scorsese, Coppola, all of the great directors ever known did not have in the fourth grade someone mentoring them to become filmmakers and understand themselves. We're not trying to make filmmakers, by the way. We're trying to make lifelong learners. So, let's go. 
LOFGREN: It was wonderful to see the film of what you're doing, and I thank you for--for that. It's a wonderful contribution to American society. 
Dr. Smith, I'm wondering if you might also jump in on the--on the question of why the profit incentive hasn't actually moved Hollywood to where we would hope they would be. 
SMITH: Well, I think there's a few things that are operating and I addressed some of them in my remarks. There's a lot of mythologizing about decision making. If you look in my written remarks, we survey--or conducted in depth interviews with over 20 underrepresented directors and asked them about the impediments that they face. 
And, market forces that are politicized seems to be one of the major factors. Individuals in green lighting positions have perceptions about what sells and what doesn't sell. And, resource allocation is very problematic, particularly for women of color. They're given lower production costs, lower marketing budgets, their films are released in fewer theaters, and so they have less support for their films to do as well as their counterparts. 
Some of this is true with films led by men of color as well. So, that--that adage of you have to work twice as hard to get half as far is actually quite true. Yet, yet our economic reality of the data and the analyses that we did on 1200 films suggests that there is a viable market for BIPOC-leads and (INAUDIBLE). 
So, the executive ranks feature very few people of color. There are few directors of color. (INAUDIBLE) sure that their stories are being told. And--and without a change in how the industry hires and crews up, this will--this inequality will keep perpetuating over time. 
LOFGREN: Well, that's why I was focusing on directors and producers. Obviously, there's an issue throughout the industry. My time has expired. Before I yield back, I had questions for Karyn Temple, but I do want to just thank her for her service to our country. She was in the (INAUDIBLE) office. You've moved on to, you know, bigger fields, but we do appreciate the work that you did there and thank you so much for your service and I yield back, Madam Chair. 
SCANLON: Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Biggs for five minutes. 
BIGGS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Villa, it's good to see you again. Thanks for being here today. Thanks to all the witnesses for being here today. Ms. Villa, I--I really want to pay tribute to you. Thank you for your advocacy for the unborn. 
VILLA: --Thank you.-- 
BIGGS: --Talk to--talk to us about the negative backlash that you've received from Hollywood for supporting President Trump, his pro-life policies, and defunding organizations liked Planned Parenthood, please. 
VILLA: Absolutely. Thank you so much. Being a proud pro-life woman, having given--given a child up for adoption and having experienced the pressure of the nurse who gave me the pregnancy test to abort my child when I was 20 years old was incredibly traumatic. There is a pressurization for women, especially women of color, to get an abortion no matter what. 
There is nothing talked about saying, you know, ""You are strong, you are proud, you are Latina, you are black, you can raise a baby or you can choose adoption."" And, I would rather our tax dollars go to adoption than abortion. 
But, as far as my attacks, there have been rape threats and death threats on my life, simply for being pro-life. And, in Hollywood, it is something that is the unspoken secret that you cannot celebrate life, you cannot celebrate God, you cannot say, ""I'm a proud pro-life Christian in Hollywood"" and achieve the same success that many A-listers do. 
In fact, many actresses brag about on the way up to their golden statuettes, that they gave their children up so that they could achieve their dreams. And, as someone who hopes to become a mother one day, I implore all mothers and fathers to not co-sign this narrative. It's incredibly dangerous to young girls to tell them, ""You can do anything you want except have a career and also be a mother."" 
Abortion is not the option. Choosing life is the most important fight and I am proud that our President approves of this and is defunding Planned Parenthood. And, Hollywood needs to open up and stop discrimination against pro-life women and men because if we are truly going to talk about diversity and supporting women, we need to talk about the unborn, the most vulnerable. 
BIGGS: Thank--thank you for your testimony. Thank you for speaking out. Mr. Whitlock, you've written extensively about Black Lives Matter and how they've corrupted the minds of many young athletes. And, you recently wrote that boycotting sports leagues for supporting BLM would be ineffective in causing change. 
You go on to state that your ""alternative to boycotting major league sports is a holistic approach of educating the athletes on what they're actually supporting. BLM is Marxist, anti-religion, anti-nuclear family, and racially divisive."" 
Big sports media companies tend to drive home the BLM narrative on behalf of athletes. Can you elaborate on how you're going about educating athletes on BLM, please? 
WHITLOCK: Yeah. I'm just trying to write about it on OutKick and talk about it on our YouTube page because I believe many of the athletes--I know many athletes. They have Christian values. They were raised in Christian homes. And, I don't think they truly understand Marxism. I don't think they know that the women who founded Black Lives Matter are trained Marxists. 
I don't think they realize that if you went to Black Lives Matter's own web page, the What We Believe section of their webpage was just an expression of Marxist theory. And, so--and, they've scrubbed some of that What We Believe because there's been a lot of pushback. 
Athletes over in Europe, the European Soccer League, they're backing away from Black Lives Matter because they realize how divisive it is, how anti-western civilization it is. And, so, you know, I don't want--I used to be--I was a college athlete. That's how I made it from poverty to a good life was I got a football scholarship. 
I don't want to demean athletes in any way, but a lot of times when you're a great athlete, you work on developing your body because it's a smart thing to do. There's a big pay day if you do it and there's some things that you kind of skip over and--and I can say that when I was in my 20s, there were a lot of things I didn't understand. And, I think a lot of these athletes, when you say the word Marxism, I don't think they understand the threat of Karl Marx and his political theory, the threat it poses to Christian values, the threat it poses to people that believe in a nuclear family. 
And, so I'm just trying to point these things out to athletes, trying to educate them on, you know, what Black Lives Matter's real agenda is and--and I legitimately think that Black Lives Matter is one of the most racist organizations we've ever seen in the history of America. Bigots love Marxism and Marxism is--it's a great marketing scheme, Black Lives Matter. It's a great slogan. But, if you look at the truth of what it truly represents and--and the agenda it's working towards, it will lead to the destruction, not just of America, but in particular black America. 
The things that allowed us to overcome slavery and make it to where we had a president elected twice in Barack Obama, the things that allowed us this incredible journey, our faith, is under attack through BLM. As I listened to Joy Villa talk about Hollywood, I lived in Los Angeles for a decade. It is hostile towards Christian values. 
We've just gone way too secular and this thing is driven by Silicon Valley and their social media apps. Twitter has got to be the most secular place on earth. If you express any type of religious faith, you're ostracized and criticized. So, I just want to take a long term approach and just try to engage athletes in a positive way and explain to them what the organization truly represents and hope that some of them wake up. 
UNKNOWN: Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. 
UNKNOWN: --Thank you. Thank you, Ms. (INAUDIBLE). 
SCANLON: Next, the chair will recognize the longstanding leader in diversity issues, the gentlewoman from Texas. 
JACKSON LEE: Madam Chair, thank you so very much and let me thank Mr. Nadler and Mr. Jordan for providing us with such a rich diversity of thought. That is clearly, I think, an important element of this and I'm delighted that the witnesses who are of varying opinions have had their opportunity to raise their voices. 
I do want to take just a moment and say that the young people that I've worked with in my own constituency, Black Lives Matter, are true young Americans. They're college students. They're empowered young athletes, brilliant. They are thoughtful. They love this country and they just want to see a life led by young people, maybe less fortunate than themselves, that would be in a nation that reimagines policing and has a just response to justice for all. 
I've had the privilege of working with them since the tragedy of the killing of Trayvon Martin. I know his mother to be a patriot and the mothers of the movement, from Eric Gardner--Garner to Tamir Rice to the mother of Michael Brown and now, as we watched the tragedies that have occurred just recently of Breonna Taylor and of course, George Floyd and Jacob Blake. 
I also think it is important to note that yesterday, a coalition of players, athletes, pro ball, of various leagues endorsed HR-40, the commission to study and develop reparation proposals, young men recognizing the history of not only their people, but their neighborhoods, thoughtful young men. 
So, let me indicate, first of all, to Erika Alexander and then to Mr. Kim if I can quickly and--and speak to how hurtful the decades have been--because you're not decades, but you are a historian--when people of color were black balled for several reasons, their looks, their hair, but also the studios were not interested because they didn't make money. Can you answer that question? I have a question for Mr. Kim and--and I'm going to try to get in one of these outstanding--all of you are outstanding actors, but this great historian and actor, Edward Olmos. Ms. Alexander? 
ALEXANDER: Yes ma'am. 
JACKSON LEE: --Did you hear the-- 
ALEXANDER: --Thank you for--could you please say that question again? 
JACKSON LEE: How is the question of race, your looks, your hair, and studios' lack of interest because of money, meaning these are not profitable films, impacted black artists? 
ALEXANDER: It's impacted them greatly. It's limited their--not only their earning power, but the potential for progress. You know, when we talk about diversity, we really should be saying racial justice because that's exactly what it is, inside of all these issues, inside of people who I may not even agree with. 
We're talking about expanding the human experience. But, when you stop any one person for the way they look, for the way they present, you're stopping not only the human story. You're stopping the American story, which is one of greatness and power because of E pluribus unum from anyone. 
So, once we start telling the story of the people who are most marginalized, we expand the vision of ourselves and more importantly, we innovate inside of it. And, since our best and most powerful export is creativity and culture, we can't--we--we will know that when we're doing that, we limit the--the power of the United States. And, that's how important it is and the years that they've done that has stopped the United States from being its most powerful self. Thank you. 
JACKSON LEE: Mr. Olmos and Mr.--thank you so very much. Mr. Olmos and Mr. Kim, I'm going to ask you this so hopefully you'll get in your comments. Mr. Olmos, culture reflects the nation. The nation reflects culture. What someone says, politics is intertwined. Public service, public leader's words mean something. What does it mean when you have the leading officer in the nation, the president, describe Latinx people as drug--drug dealers? 
Mr. Kim, what does it mean when COVID-19 that has hit minorities harder than any other population is described that the China virus for culture, for people understanding--which is what art is all about, making sure people understand difference or tell stories differently, whether it's fiction or not. 
Mr. Olmos, your comments, please. 
OLMOS: It's devastating to my children, to myself, to people of a Latino descent. It is only can be said that anyone that speaks like this about another culture has the right to do that in this country, but they don't have the right to tell lies. And, that's what's happening. 
Not every single person--they encompass so much. I'm not going to say that we don't have people that are doing things that are against the law, but so are all the cultures. What makes me sad is that we haven't gotten to the point of where we understand who we are as people. 
What we've got to understand is that there's only one race, the human race. That's it. There's no African or indigenous or Asian or Latino or--or Caucasian race. There's only one race, the human race, and inside of that, there are cultures. But, you cannot tell me that--that English--the English look like--or act or feel like the Irish (INAUDIBLE)-- 
UNKNOWN: I'm sorry, Mr. Olmos, the gentlewoman's time has expired. Mr. Kim, could you answer very, very briefly? 
JACKSON LEE: Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Mr. Kim? 
KIM: Sure. I will say--I will say that when the leader of our country refers to a virus as--as coming from a particular country, he may have his own reasons for doing that that are political and a statement against maybe the leadership of that country. But, the virus does have a scientific name and that is COVID-19 and when the ramifications of the words he uses not only affects Chinese people, but Chinese Americans and all Asian Americans to the tune of 2800 hate crimes or acts of violence against them in--in several months. 
That's something that needs to get examined because words do matter. And, so--and our leadership sets the tone. 
JACKSON LEE: Thank you. That means diversity is crucial in the arts. Thank you so very much, Madam Chair, for your courtesy. I yield back. 
SCANLON: Thank you. The gentlewoman from Arizona is recognized for five minutes. 
LESKO: Thank you, Madam Chairman, and I want to thank all of the people that are testifying and I appreciate your success and applaud you for your successes. 
First of all, I want to say that I agree, all people should be treated equally and they should not be discriminated against. And, so I call on my democratic colleagues and some of the testifiers to stand up for people that have diversity in thought as well. As we've heard from--from Joy Villa today, that she has been discriminated against because of her beliefs, because she is pro-life, because she supports Donald Trump. 
And, I'd hope that you will realize and think about it, that the discrimination that you have witnessed and you have experienced because of your race or sex that you have told us about, I hope you realize the same thing is happening about people's beliefs. 
For instance, I'm a pro-life woman and I stood up against government funding of abortions and national Planned Parenthood put my phone number, my home phone number, out for the whole world to see. And, I got the most vile calls, people telling me I should stick things into places that you don't want to know. 
This is not right. So, I agree with you, we should not discriminate. But, please, tell your co--co-workers, tell your co-producers, tell your other people, you should not discriminate based on what people believe. There is too much cancel culture going on right now. People are afraid. Workers are afraid to speak up for fear they are going to get fired. This is happening in all different sectors. 
So, I do not have questions today. But, I want you to think about this. When you have seen discrimination because of race, because of sex, or you have experienced it, please know that people right now are being discriminated against because of what they believe. There's an instance right in Arizona State University. I'm from Arizona. There is a young woman who is a student employee who is the manager of a student radio station. All she did was re-tweet out something. It wasn't even bad. And, all of the sudden, she's fired. This is outrageous. 
And, so I hope that you will understand that no one should be discriminated against, not only because of their--not just because of their race, not just because of their sex, but also because of what we believe, because our country was founded on people having different opinions. And, if we squelch the opinion of one side just because we don't agree with them, the future of our nation is at risk. 
And, Mr. Kim, the reason that people voted against the resolution that you are talking about was because inserted in that was a political attack specifically designed against the president of the United States. I have a large Asian American community in my district and I totally appreciate them, and I try to respect all people no matter what their race, no matter what their sex, and certainly no matter what they believe. 
So, thank you all for testifying. Please take my words to heart. And, with that, I yield back. 
SCANLON: Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. Deutch for five minutes. 
DEUTCH: Thank you, Madam Chairman. Madam Chairman, there are certain fundamentals that underlay everything that we do here in Congress. We have a shared faith in our institutions, even when we examine and challenge them. We have a shared tradition of defending the right to vote, even when we disagree on how best to accomplish that. And, we have a shared trust that there will be a peaceful transition of power regardless of whether we like the outcome of an election. 
President Trump's comments yesterday, his inability to acknowledge that there will be a peaceful transition of power, undercut these shared truths. We cannot just continue going about this committee's business or any person to undermine the bedrock of our democracy that free and fair elections determine our government and our leaders. 
So, I would ask this committee, I would ask my colleagues that we join together to protect our democracy, to protect our citizens and their right to vote and to protect America. 
Now, yesterday, we learned that no one will be charged in the death of Breonna Taylor. No charges for an officer blindly firing into Breonna Taylor's apartment, killing her, and that's because that's how the system that we have works. The racism that denies Breonna Taylor justice is baked in. That is how Kimberle Crenshaw, Executive Director of the African American Policy Forum put it yesterday. 
I quote her. ""If we thought the problem and the solution to the tragedy of Breonna Taylor was simply prosecuting these cops, then we're not understanding the broader systemic conditions that allow for the kind of policing that disproportionately imperils black Americans,"" which is to say we've got a lot of work to do. This committee has a lot of work to do. 
Our government, law enforcement agencies, courts, schools, workplaces, and yes our entertainment and media too have a lot of work to do to address those systemic conditions that deny Breonna Taylor justice and that deny us all justice as a result. 
Madam Chairman, I'd like to enter into the record this Washington Post article entitled, ""Allegation of Racism--Allegations of Racism have marked Trump's presidency and become key issue as election nears."" 
SCANLON: Without objection. 
DEUTCH: Thank you. I want to thank all of the witnesses for taking the time to share their experiences with us. Diversity and representation in media matters. The stories that we tell and the people we see telling them are connected to how we see people in our daily lives. 
Ms. Temple, I appreciate your sharing your own experiences and your proactive agreement that more needs to be done by your industry in this regard. And, I know that MPA and others in the industry have begun the process of developing a more diverse pool of talent in front of and behind the camera. The problem is by no means limited to the media world. We see a shocking lack of women and people of color in board rooms across all sectors. 
But, while we are here focusing specifically on media as the outsized power that film and television have in shaping our culture and even more fundamentally, our views about what doctors look like, what lawyers look like, what a fairytale princess or superhero looks like, and yes, what criminals look like. 
Mr. Olmos, I can't help but feel that you've been sounding the alarm on criminal justice reform and especially the intersection of criminal justice reform and minority representation for decades and it is finally getting the attention that it deserves. And, as a long-time activist on criminal justice reform issues and building off your work, what are some of the societal changes that are leading to the disproportionate numbers of minorities in our criminal justice system, our jails, and our prisons? 
OLMOS: Education. Education and understanding of our community as to what causes this action to happen. Now, basically we are all able to understand that there are a lot of people in jail, but why is it so disproportioned? Why is that happening? That's always been said and it is not the answer that illuminates. It's the question. 
And, the question always is, is that people have a really difficult time with people of color. They won't do the things that they will do for non-people of color. They won't educate them. They won't allow them the right to vote even. We have the right to vote and yet we're getting slammed right now in the minority areas with the whole situation with the President of the United States understanding of using mail-in ballots. 
We have a difficulty in criminal law. We have a difficulty in the way that they use criminal law. The way we use criminal law is different for the colored people versus the white people. And, I've got to tell you right now, it's a disaster. 
DEUTCH: Thank you, Mr. Olmos. Thanks to our witnesses and thank you, Madam Chairman. I yield back. 
SCANLON: Yes, the Chair recognizes Mr. Jordan for five minutes. 
JORDAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Whitlock, do we have a functioning first amendment when 62 percent of Americans feel like they can't express themselves freely? 
WHITLOCK: Absolutely not and I appreciate you not asking me to make a negative comment about President Trump, who's not a part of the media. You guys called a meeting to discuss the media and somehow--you should have just asked us to pre-record negative comments about President Trump and then we could actually talk about the topics you've asked our time to speak about, the media. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan. Go ahead. 
JORDAN: No, no, no, I--well said. Do you have a free speech rights when only one side is allowed to talk, which is exactly what the cancel culture mob is doing today. 
WHITLOCK: Absolutely not. I'm going to go on another rant. I would wish we could talk about Big Tech's takeover of free speech. 
JORDAN: --Yep.-- 
WHITLOCK: Silicon Valley is in control of America. It's in control of the American media. There's only one strain of thought allowed. If you do not agree with Silicon Valley and Northern California's radical point of view, they will cancel you and silence you on their social media apps and in any other way possible try to smear your character. 
I've been through the whole cancel culture thing, driven by Silicon Valley and the political activists on the left. This whole thing, I've got to be honest with you, Mr. Jordan, I'm glad you invited me, but it's frustrating. 
My parents have always been mad at me because I--I--to be quite honest, I refuse to vote. I don't like politicians. I just--and this experience I'm witnessing here today, people grand-standing and trying to make comments about Trump and whatever when we're here to talk about the media, it pisses me off. It's a clown--what's my tax dollars going for? 
Are we here to conduct business and get at real issues or are we here to just put out a commercial about--an anti-Trump commercial? I don't want any parts in that. I don't participate in any of this presidential politics. I didn't have anything negative to say about Barack Obama. I don't got anything negative to say about President Trump. Let's talk about the media and too many of you guys are on the payroll of Big Tech. 
JORDAN: Let me ask you this. And, you referenced it in those--those comments. Ms. Weiss represent my opening statement. Bari Weiss of The New York Times talked about the digital thunder dome. If you--if you attempt, so your--most of Americans are afraid to do it, but if you step out and speak out against the mob, do you think that's the appropriate term, this term that she used, digital thunder dome? And, if so, have you ever been in the thunder dome? I think you alluded to that. 
WHITLOCK: I'm in it virtually every day and Bari Weiss was 1,000 percent correct. She called Twitter the editor for The New York Times and Twitter is the editor for the American media-- 
JORDAN: --Yep.-- 
WHITLOCK: --and Twitter is a rigged algorithm that imposes a world view that is anti-American, anti-religion, anti-the values that we were funded in, anti-the values that got us--that made this country the ideal human experiment that all these people ranting and raving and complaining about America, you couldn't get them to leave America with a stick of dynamite and $1 million in cash. They would not leave. 
They all alleged they hate America and America is--it's the greatest human experiment we've ever had. 
JORDAN: --Yep. Well said.-- 
WHITLOCK: Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But, this--thanks for inviting me-- 
JORDAN: --Let me--let me ask you this and I want to--I want to ask Ms.--Ms. Villa this as well. Will the--will the cancel culture mobs just stop with conservatives and Republicans or will they come after Democrats at some point too? Ms. Villa and then we'll go back to Mr. Whitlock if we have time. 
VILLA: Absolutely and I would like to say Ronda Kennedy-Baldwin is my counsel here. She's a black woman, mother of six, and cancel culture is an infection. They're going after everybody. They're going after Democrats, they're going after longstanding celebrities, black, Latino, it doesn't matter. 
Cancel culture is a virus that is attacking every single facet and I've heard a lot of bashing of the president here. I want to, you know, join along with Mr. Whitlock. Why can't we stay on the topic? Why can't we talk about diversity in media rather than insulting the president? 
You--if you can't have one subject where you talk about diversity and media, when you have a black woman and Latino woman right here in front of you and all this diversity behind us, and you still have to talk about the president. It's sad, it's pathetic, it's embarrassing quite honestly, and I am proud to be here and say that this president has perpetrated more diversity than any other president. He's been the most pro-black president. 
The First Step Act, you want to talk about disproportionate black and brown people, and you want to talk about in--in--pr--in criminal justice reform. Not one Democrat has done anything for criminal justice reform. You wanna talk about Joe Biden's character? But I'm not gonna bring that up. I'm gonna go back to what we're talking about here. And representation in media matters. But we must have diversity of thought. 
Big tech needs to be held accountable. The big studios need to be held accountable. And every single celebrity that wants to talk about only what they're doing is ignoring the fact that Black Lives Matter in the name of diversity is saying black lives only matter and they're killing police officers every day. That is not diversity. That's violence-- 
JORDAN: --Where--there were--Ms. Villa, Mr. Whitlock there were four members of Congress shadow banned by Twitter two summers ago. Any guess as to whether they four Republican--there's--by the same party. Would you think they were Republicans or Democrat? 
VILLA: Republicans. 
JORDAN: Yeah. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Gates, Meadows, Nunez, Jordan. We know, as Mr. Whitlock said, big tech is out to get conservatives-- 
VILLA: --That's right-- 
JORDAN: --That's why we need to be looking at Section 230. How we fix that--make sure that the platform isn't--is--is in fact neutral and not censoring people. When Twitter can let the Ayatollah of--of--of--of Iran put out a statement say they will strike a blow against American citizens and that's fine. But then they will censor the President's Tweets. I think it proves Mr. Whitlock's point. I yield back. And I apologize to our witnesses. I have to run to another vote and we're back and forth. But I'll--I'll--I'll be back. 
NADLER: The gentleman yields back. I'll yield myself of--to ask--ask questions. First of all for Mr. Olmos, though it's of course not universal and strides have surely been made it still appears that actors who are either women or people of color are too often given only supporting roles or token roles with few lines and little character development on film and tv. We want to see less of that and more leading roles. 
How do you think we can break down the barriers that people of color face so that actors from unret--underrepresented groups can take center stage just as often as white male actors? 
OLMOS: Well the--first of all and foremost the industry has to really want to do stories about minorities. Indigenous people deserve their stories being told. And we should see them and we'd love them. And they could be commercial. African Americans are doing a great job. Latinos, we're 20 something percent of the population. We're less than four percent of the people who we see on screen. 
All I can say is that it--it's up to us. That's why we did and why we're doing the educational system. We are doing YCP for a reason. We are--are dem--we are really training the future. Now in 10 or 15 years you're gonna see a huge difference because the quality of the storytellers will be diverse. We're not only doing this for Latino children. These are all the children in California that are in the system right now that are getting this. 
We are so fortunate to be able to do this because it builds the self-esteem, self-respect, and their self-worth. It makes them collaborate, communicate, use their critical thinking and creativity. And that to me is the essence of how one becomes all that they can be. And I say to you and all of us let the children get educated. 
NADLER: And Ms.--Ms. Temple, it's good to see you again in your new role. What change can we expect to see from studios in the next five years to improve diversity do you think? 
TEMPLE: Well I think what you will see is an expansion of the positive gains that we've talked about a little bit in terms of representation both in front of and behind the camera. As I mentioned earlier in--in my opening remarks there have been gains. Even the Hollywood and Diversity Report noted that there were gains in some of the major areas that they had looked at in terms of--you know--film roles, film directors, and others participating in the industry. 
So those are all positive steps. Obviously as I said earlier, those gains are not enough. And more needs to be done. I think you will see an expansion. Because I--again--I think that this is obviously a long term process and there are a number of programs and initiatives that I've talked about that really did just get started over the last few years. So I think as those programs and initiatives and every single one of our--our companies--our member studios has those types of programs--as those programs continue to grow and expand I think that you will see increased numbers of representation both in front of and behind the camera. 
And we recognize that there have been--you know--somewhat broader gains in front of the camera than behind the camera. And you need both. And so I think you will actually see that commitment continue in a--and--and en--expanding and really hopefully the numbers expanding as well. 
NADLER: Thank you. Now we're currently in the midst of a pandemic and recession that are disproportionately impacting people of color especially black and Latino people. Economic inequality has long disproportionately impacted people of color. This recession could further exacerbate it. The pandemic offers television and film production companies an opportunity to reset and reassess what shows or films continue in the development pipeline. 
Let me ask you Mr. Kim, what--what are concrete steps the industry can take to ensure that the content pipeline includes shows and film that will employ people of color in front of and behind the camera? 
KIM: Thanks for the question. It's a good one. I think it's a multi-pronged approach. You know--I happen to be the executive producer of a show called The Good Doctor on ABC. And I can tell you that one of the things that the network is actually doing is setting an aggressive set of goals for diversity in front of and behind the camera. Obviously these kinds of goals are--are--are not specifically mandates. And they--they require time for them to be ins--implemented. 
But I think it's important. I think it's important that those goals exist. From--from the--the--the most powerful places, the distributors. I think it's also important that content creators are very aware of--of--of the kinds of projects that we are--we're making with an eye toward representing the world we'd like to see. And I also think what's really important is to create a pipeline of writers, actors, and directors the way that Mr. Olmos is doing to--to--to foster the next generation of--of people who will be sitting in those seats of power. 
So it's--it's a number of different things. And COVID in some ways has accelerated trends that are already existing in the industry such as the trend towards streaming and the trend toward different kinds of storytelling. So it's important to--to--to listen to what's going on in society as well as try and heed it. 
NADLER: Well thank you. Mr. Alexander can you add anything to that--as to what concrete steps the industry can take? 
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir. I think that we need to make sure that the power of the purse to make production companies more racially diverse and their teams should be used. And we should definitely work on training programs--training programs and also they are very few people who are on these teams that are able to have hiring authority. 
So to make sure that we can get writers and directors and producers and casting directors to--that usually have that type of power. And empowered. Thank you. 
NADLER: Thank you. Mr. Cicilline. 
CICILLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I wanna first thank my friend and colleague from Florida Mr. Deutch for raising a very important issue that I think everyone has a responsibility to speak to directly. The president yesterday refused to say that he would accept the results of the election if he lost and accept the peaceful transfer of power. And worse than that, he said the problem is ballots. Oh, too many ballots. 
Of course ballots and the right to vote are the cornerstone of our democracy and the most powerful expression of that democracy. And it was a sad day to hear the president say that he would not accept a peaceful transition of power. The problem was people were gonna vote. And to hear so much silence on the other side of the aisle. 
I also want to say that before I get to my first question I think the truth matters. Mr. Whitlock said oh, Black Lives Matters has on its website it's a Marxist organization. So let me be clear. Black Lives Matter--and I'm reading from the website--was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's murderer. It is an organization whose mission is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on black communities. 
So it's a very clear--that's--that--that's not Marxist ideology. That I hope is American ideology. That is to stand up against white supremacy and to empower communities. So my first question is Dr. Smith, you've done an enormous amount of research about the importance of people seeing themselves in characters both on the small and big screen. Why is that important? 
And your research that I--I reviewed in your written testimony shows that disproportionately communities of color, particularly blacks and Latinos, are depicted--the number one category is criminal. And what's the impact of that? 
SMITH: Well I think the research is really clear. Particularly when individuals lack direct experience the media can play a notable role in shaping attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs about different groups. There's decades of research to show that the mass media can play an independent or interactive role when it comes to media effects. And when it comes to identity it can shape a whole series of different outcomes. And I believe it was Mr. Olmos who referred to self-esteem being one of the key indicators. 
I--I want to--to take this moment to--to illustrate that while a lot of the ideas and--and commentary here I--are very interesting to listen to the decision making capabilities of who to hire in Hollywood has--has prevented for decades women, people of color, member of the LGBTQ community, and people with disabilities from access and opportunity on screen and behind the camera. 
The pipeline is there. The pipeline is there. We need resources to fund motion pictures and content for people of color behind the camera to tell their stories. Because if they are simply given the opportunity to tell their stories like their white male counterparts the stories will be there. And people will see themselves reflected in nuanced, authentic, and compelling ways. 
But we don't see that. We know that people are submitting to the Sundance Film Festivals from a whole series of different backgrounds. Let's fund the Sundance Institute to make sure that those storytellers--because there's a relationship between presenting your film at Sundance and having a film in its top grossing (AUDIO GAP) 100--best pictures--top grossing picture-- 
CICILLINE: --Thank you Dr. Smith. I want--want to try to get in one more question. But thank you, Dr. Smith. Mr. Dae Kim thank you for changing your mind and agreeing to testify. Your testimony was compelling and important and I too was deeply saddened by the fact that that vote against that resolution was not unanimous. And it just evidences that we have a lot of work to do. 
Wh--what I'd like to ask you to address is what can we do and what we can incentivize within your industry to help ensure that there's better representation in front of the camera and behind the camera for communities of color, women, LGBTQ individuals, indigenous people. Because we understand from the research what the absence of their representation means not just for those communities but for the entire country and the world. 
KIM: So when you say we--thank you, Representative-- 
CICILLINE: --Congress. Congress and you in--in the industry. 
(LAUGHTER) 
KIM: You and me? No, I think it's a great question. Because one thing I don't want to dismiss or--is--is this idea of being excellent at your craft. And--you know--one of the things about diversity is that no one is asking to give opportunities that are not earned. And--and so--you know--we talk about, like, ways that the system can help increase diversity. But what's also important is the way that we can handle ourselves. 
We must be the best we can be at what we choose to do, whether it's acting, writing, and directing. Anything in the arts. And I think the way that Congress can help us is one, the--through hearings such as this. Because I think it's important to hear the perspectives of people like everyone on this panel. You know--both left and right. And I think what's--what--what--I think what they say builds character is thoughts that build--that lead to words that lead to actions that lead to habits that lead to character. 
The--the--what we're doing here today is we're planting new thoughts. We're planting the seeds that will--that we hope will blossom into a new way of thinking and building character. And to bring it back to how it relates to media, media is the way that--to implant thoughts. Just as Mr. Olmos said, when we first saw Jaws I--you know--we were terrified of sharks. I was afraid to go into my bathtub after I saw Jaws. And--you know--when we were--when--when we were young playing cowboys and Indians, how many of us thought that the Indians were the bad guys? And that's because we were taught through all of the cowboy westerns that that was the way it was supposed to be. 
How many of us thought that when we saw--first saw Bruce Lee that all Asian American people knew Kung Fu? So these are the ways that--that--that talking about these things and highlighting these issues affect the way we think. And I think to answer your question more succinctly, when we talk about pipelines, when we talk about people in positions of power that's you. I mean look at this room. These are--you are the people who effect change in this country as much as anyone else. 
And so when--when we see people like yourself being influenced and--and--and--and understanding the issue in new ways that is already a way that we can change things. So there--there are a number of ways that--that we can--that you and I-- 
NADLER: --Time of the-- 
KIM: --And all of us in this room can--can--can help with progress. 
CICILLINE: Thank you so much-- 
NADLER: --Time of the gentleman is expired. 
CICILLINE: I thought he was gonna make reference to my being a member of the Screen Actors Guild, Mr. Chairman. 
(LAUGHTER) 
I am. You know, we're--when he was talking about the craft--you know. 
(LAUGHTER) 
NADLER: Ms.--Ms. Jayapal. 
JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for being here today. You know--I--it--it must be--it must be very nice to be able to look at the screen or to go to a movie and see yourself reflected in every show. To know that whatever you choose to do you'll get the same opportunity. To know that our stories are reflected when we switch on that tv or go to the movies. 
I don't understand how a conversation about diversity and appropriate representation in the media has turned into a conversation about the cancel culture. When I was growing up in India and Indonesia we only used to get one American television show a day on our tv. And our family would rush to see those shows. And I loved them all. But I noticed something. There was only one of those shows that actually had any actors that were people of color. 
And it was Hawaii Five-O. The original one, that is. And it quickly became our favorite show and I've stayed a fan, Mr. Kim, with this version as well. Watching it sometimes I will admit is my guilty pleasure when I'm supposed to be doing other things. Our stories matter. Because what we see on the screen creates the landscape for our society. 
They tell young people what is possible for them to have in the same way that having more women and people of color in Congress matters. And they help to shape our views, positive and negative. That's why Ava DuVernay's When They See Us or Pose or even Atypical which tells the story of a teenager with Autism matter. 
After the September 11th attacks I founded and lead the largest immigrant rights organization in Washington state, and we initially started our work responding to the backlash, hate crimes, and discrimination against Muslims, Arab Americans, east Africans, and south Asians. The threat of hate violence after 9/11 was paralyzing for our communities. And it did not help that Hollywood too often presented Muslims as terrorists. And frankly we're still fighting stereotypes against our community. A fight that is made far more difficult when we can't tell our own stories and people can't see us in the media as the beautiful, complex, and full people that we are. 
So, Ms. Smith, in the 19 years since the September 11th attacks we've seen Hollywood start to include Muslims and Sikhs and south Asians in stories but often as side characters and often as terrorists, not as regular people. And meanwhile assaults and hate crimes against Muslims have been on the rise since 2001, peaking in 2016 with 127 anti-Muslim assaults. Is there a connection here between the way a community is portrayed on the screen and how they're seen and treated in their own communities? 
SMITH: I think when--I think when--when you look at the research definitely there's an impact that the media can play on shaping the attitudes, perceptions, and the beliefs of different groups. Particularly in the absence of direct contact with members of that community. And this is why in my written testimony we do reference the negative stereotypes that are far too often with a series of different groups--whether it's based on race ethnicity, LGBTQ, or faith--when they're conjoined with images of crime and violence there can be detrimental and harmful effects. 
I'm happy to report that we are actually looking into Muslim representation at the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and I would love to follow up with you in the future about the results of that investigation and the efforts that we're pursing in that (INAUDIBLE). 
JAYAPAL: Wonderful. And just very quickly cause I have another question for Mr. Kim. I know that your institute performed an analysis on race, gender and ethnicity of directors for the top 10 fictional films. And among he 1300 films you found that only 3 percent of the directors were Asian, and that included only two Asian women directors. Quickly, why is the director role so crucial to the work to diversify the industry? 
SMITH: More leads behind the--more leads on screen that are from racial and ethnic groups. More speaking characters from racial/ethnic groups. More likely to hire below the line crew that are from diverse backgrounds and if the audience is over 45 percent people of color it connects with audiences not only in the United State but communicates an image globally about the world in which we live. And so the director identity has the top leadership position in or on a production team really matters for all of those hiring positions being associated with increases particularly for marginalized communities. 
JAYAPAL: Thank you so much. Mr. Kim, you know I'm a fan. You talked about in your testimony that media is a value delivery system. Can you speak to that a little bit more what it means to be a groundbreaking bilingual Asian actor in an industry where there were very few people who looked like you and very few parts that reflect the values and real lives of Asian folks like us? 
KIM: Thank you for the question and I have to say I'm a fan of yours Representative. You're incredibly articulate and thank you for participating. I would say that like cigarettes are a nicotine delivery system television and film and media is also a value delivery system of sorts. We shape what is acceptable in society by what we see on television and vice versa what we see on television is a reflection of society. They are intertwined. And so when we see that it's acceptable to put people of color in secondary roles and--and constantly have the white leads of every show save the day we are subconsciously or consciously making the correlation between their abilities and what we see on screen. 
And so, it's incredibly important that we have people of all shapes and sizes doing every different thing. It's not that--it's not that people of color are asking only to be leads or only to be heroes I think what people of color are asking for is the diversity of representation so that when we see someone who looks like you or me we don't' automatically have preconceived notions of what they can or cannot do based solely on our skin color. 
So I think that's really an important thing. A lot of the testimony here-- 
NADLER: The time of the--time of the gentleman has expired. Now, recognize Ms. Demings who has been a leader in media diversity for years. 
JAYAPAL: Thank you, Mr. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
DEMINGS: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to all of our witnesses for joining us today as we have this very important discussion. Because this discussion has taken so many different forms I was a little confused at one time about what hearing I was in. For the record I will just say that I am a black woman I know everybody can see that. I am a former police chief, a career law enforcement officer, and I am a Christian. 
And Ms. Villa, I don't--I don't know about anybody else but I don't care about you being a conservative. But I do care about how black and brown people have been treated in this country for 400 years. I do care about that. I'm a black woman. I know what discrimination feels like. I know what name calling, the first time I was called the N word I was four years old. So I--I--I can--I can talk about this issue because I lived it myself. 
And we've talked about women's' right to choose here, we've talked bout the police, we've gone into some areas that I'm not really sure why. And--and you know, as we talk about diversity in the entertainment field I know that's why we're here we also need to get to a discussion where we talk about it in the news media too. I know that will be a different hearing but who tells the story matters because it brings different perspectives to the issue. So when the viewer, the listener walks away they'll have a better opinion. 
You know, as we talk about criminal justice I think the problem is sometimes is that we want to start at the beginning or at the end. We want to start with the police as opposed to looking at what has transpired long before the police were ever called in the first place. We cannot just hold one system accountable in America if we are going to make a difference. We have got to hold all systems accountable that have failed us. We're not here to criticize the entertainment industry but doggonit we ought to be here to make it better. So that little girls and little boys like me and from Hispanic and Latino communities can have an equal opportunity to succeed. To be a part of telling that story. 
And Dr. Smith, I do want to thank you so much for giving us the--the statistics. Because we can argue and debate all day long that we're here to bash the president. That doesn't get anything done we know that. We can talk about why we're here. We are here to make the world a better place for the people that we represent. If that's not your motive then shame on you. Shame on you. I don't care what political party you're in that tells a story. I'm just saying that more black and brown people and--and people of diversity should be telling the story. Wow. 
So with that, than you for that moment. Ms. Temple, and--and forgive me if you have answered this question because we went in so many different direction because we were so busy trying to represent one person we forgot the people that we truly represent, the hundreds and thousands in each of our district. Can you tell me what steps that studios, networks, production companies can take to significantly increase the percentage of people of color with green light authority on their contact team over the next five years? 
You know, many times I hear I remember recruiting at the police department and--and being told that well there's just nobody out there that can do the job. I don't believe--we have very talented people of all colors. But we have to come up with creative ways if we really care about our industry, to make sure that those very creative, very talented people of all color have an opportunity to participate. 
So Ms. Temple, that is my one question thank you so much for your answer. 
TEMPLE: Thank you and I did want to say before I got into that answer that I really do appreciate hearing from all of the creators who spoke here today. They really did you know, eloquently talk about their personal experiences in the industry. And I think that's really important to hear from their perspectives and that's part of the way that we can actually jointly figure out how to do better in the industry. So definitely want to thank them for participating. 
As I mentioned earlier and I--I eluded to a bit in my oral testimony and had a few more details in my written testimony--it--it's not going to be a one stop shop. There's not one easy way to--to solve some of these issues. I think everybody here has recognized that these issues are longstanding and so they are going to take a multiple pronged approach. But I do think that some of the initiatives that I mentioned earlier that the studios are doing now will make a difference, will increase representation both in front of and behind the cam--the camera. 
For example, Warner Media (INAUDIBLE) just announced a production diversity report where they pledge to use their best efforts to ensure that they have a diverse cast and crew. CBS Studios has announced that its developments and writer's rooms by the 2021/22--22 season--season will have 25 percent of the script development budget will be allocated to diverse creators and 40 percent to diverse--diverse writers. 
So each and you know, I could go on and on. Each one of the studios has recognized that there is an issue and has committed in very concrete ways to make sure that those issues can be addressed. And again, it's not going to be one program I don't' think that will solve everything but a combination of these types of programs and conversations quite frankly, with the creators that are here today and with you on ways that the industry can work together to move forward I think will go a long way to--to making things better. 
DEMINGS: We'll reach out to you. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
VILLA: I'd like to respond to Ms. Demings calling me out. 
NADLER: No, no the gentlelady-- 
VILLA: Am I able to respond? 
NADLER: (INAUDIBLE) 
VILLA: She did mention my name and call me out. I'd just like to respond. 
NADLER: Gentlelady--gentlelady yielded back. Mr. Correa is recognized. 
CORREA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Want to ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record two letters one by Pippa Cerna(PH) it will be published in the Latin Heat Entertainment the Latino media industry publication and letter from National Hispanic Media Coalition. 
NADLER: Without objection. 
CORREA: Just want to confirm, Mr. Chairman, that this is--this hearing is about diversity in the media. Not about the president. Not about other issues. This is about diversity in the media. And if I may start with one statement which is--One nation under God with Liberty and Justice for all. I grew up as a kid believing in that. This great country, equality and then after a while you realize you're a bit different than the other kids--where you live, how you live, poverty and the things kids tell you day in and day out. And you begin to notice the media that molds affects, attitudes, predispositions on who you are as a community and what your contributions are to this country. Mr. Olmos said something very interesting and reminded me of all those World War II veterans in my district--all of them highly decorated yet, you never read about them anywhere. 
Jose Ancangalibay(PH) first casualty of war in the Iraq war. A DREAMer in my district. And every time I quiz kids people in my district, veterans who is this man? Nobody knows. And that's because we choose not to focus on these individuals. 
I want to come back to the issue of media in our society. Heard some folks talking about the role of government and that only the best and brightest should get those roles in media. Only the best and brightest should be there. And yet, let me tell you something that in my opinion media is not totally about free market, free enterprise. Media is subsidized by the government. Media is regulated by the government and therefore we as elected officials have a role on what media is about in our society. 
When I was in the California State legislature every year motion picture association would come to Sacramento and ask for hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure that there was no runaway production from the state of California. So you talk about government, free enterprise, no such distinction. Yet at the same time today we're talking about things like the mob. 
This issue is not new. I've been addressing Latinos in the media since the early 90's, Hispanic Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been meeting--meeting with folks like Jack Valente(PH) for the last 20 years--no change. 
So in my limited less than, two minutes left I'm going to ask Ms. Smith, Ms. Temple, what is it that we have to do to change the outcomes, the people in front in back of the cameras--what is it that we need to do to change and I don't see change coming. Ms. Smith, what do we have to do to address these bottlenecks in the media, in the way they portray people of color today in America? 
SMITH: That's a great question and in my written testimony I go on at length about solutions for change. And so until you change hiring practices these numbers will not move. A lot of these numbers-- 
CORREA: So what do you do to change the hiring practices? We've been--we've been at this for 30 years, 40 years. 
SMITH: Two things, sir. One is that these companies have to set target inclusion goals. They have to make those publicly accountable. The have to have a strategy for change and they have to have objective and quantifiable criteria on who they are going to hire because that reduces biased. I am not aware. 
CORREA: Ms. Smith, I look forward to working with you on these issues because those are great words, great objectives but I want more. And, Mr. Olmos-- 
SMITH: Can I tell you something else, sir? 
CORREA: Mr. Olmos, I would--I got 30 seconds left. I will talk to you later on off the screen so to speak. Mr. Olmos, I just want to thank you very much for investing in our communities. I represent Santa Ana High School where you have donated your own private library and resources to create a multimedia center under your name. That's what we need to do to move the ball forward. 
And again, Mr. Chairman, I hope we continue to have these kinds of hearings not one every two or three years but consistently to see how we're moving the ball forward. With that being said, I yield the remainder of my time. Thank you very much. 
NADLER: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Johnson. 
HANK JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for hosting this very important hearing and I wanted to ask Mr. Whitlock--and by the way, I--I want to commend all of the witnesses for your excellent testimony. 
Mr. Whitlock you are a sports journalist obviously dabbling in right wing Republican politics. I wanted to ask you did you have the oprpoutnity to--to see The Black Panther, the movie? 
WHITLOCK: Of course--of course I saw the movie. Yeah. (INAUDIBLE)-- 
HANK JOHNSON: What did you think about it 
WHITLOCK: (INAUDIBLE) or vote in any politics. 
HANK JOHNSON: What did you think about it? 
WHITLOCK: --participated or voted in any politics so (INAUDIBLE). 
HANK JOHNSON: What did you think about the movie? 
WHITLOCK: I thought it was fine. 
HANK JOHNSON: Did you-- 
WHITLOCK: I thought it was fine. I thought it was a good movie. 
HANK JOHNSON: What was it about the movie that made it such a grand success? 
WHITLOCK: Well, I think they invested a lot of money in it. You--you get what you pay for and having lived out in Los Angeles and Hollywood for a long time the amount of money invested in a movie a lot of times determines its level of success. They invested a lot of money. It's America. 
HANK JOHNSON: Hm. Well, I guess it being a black film though it didn't get as much money invested in it as some of the other films that have been blockbusters, would you agree? 
WHITLOCK: I have no idea. That would be speculation on my part. I--think (INAUDIBLE)-- 
HANK JOHNSON: Would you be surprised-- 
WHITLOCK: What's that? 
HANK JOHNSON: Would you be surprised to learn that other films that were less of a blockbuster but they were majority films directed to a majority audience lots of money invested but they weren't as big as the Black Panther? 
WHITLOCK: Mr. Johnson, I'm a journalist. I need some facts to work with. I--I hear (INAUDIBLE) opinion. 
HANK JOHNSON: I'm trying to find out from you whether or not it was the content of the movie as opposed to the investment that made it the blockbuster. What do you think? 
WHITLOCK: I'm not a movie critic--I'm a sports journalist. 
HANK JOHNSON: Well, you're also dabbling in right wing politics too. I'm just asking you about the movie because you--we--we're talking about movies and film production today. 
WHITLOCK: (INAUDIBLE) your false narrative as fact. Let's say I took your false narrative as fact and I dabble in right wing politics. How does that qualify me to talk about a movie? 
HANK JOHNSON: That's why I'm wondering why you are here today. I mean, you apparently were told that this hearing the subject was--was different than the one that you are here to testify about. And I just wanted to-- 
WHITLOCK: (INAUDIBLE) 
HANK JOHNSON: --I just wanted to find out from you whether or not you got anything positive out of the--out of the Black Panther move or not. 
WHITLOCK: (INAUDIBLE) 
HANK JOHNSON: Let me go to Ms. Villa and ask Ms. Villa whether or not she-- 
VILLA: Thank you. 
HANK JOHNSON: What were you-- 
VILLA: Of course I was a fan of that movie. And if you're talking budgets it shows that you absolutely are not in the entertainment industry. Budgets are not racist. They're allocated towards who's starring in the movie or production company is behind the movie. The movie was excellent. I'm not going to deny that. 
HANK JOHNSON: Why--why was it excellent? 
VILLA: It was excellent because it was a superhero movie. 
HANK JOHNSON: OK. 
VILLA: It stars an incredible superhero who is a nationalist--who wants the best for his nation. Just like Donald Trump. 
HANK JOHNSON: Was there anything about the fact it was black--a black superhero that-- 
VILLA: You want me to say because it's a black man in the movie? I love the movie being about a superhero who was undeniably black. An African and running his nation. 
HANK JOHNSON: We haven't seen--we haven't seen that many black superhero movies in this country. 
VILLA: We haven't. But making a mandate making it illegal unless you absolutely have a certain representation is only going to hurt filmmakers. 
HANK JOHNSON: Now hold on--hold on now. 
VILLA: (INAUDIBLE) since 2017 the Oscar nominations included-- 
HANK JOHNSON: I'm not going to let you take over--I'm not going to let you take over the hearing, ma'am. I'm asking you a question. 
VILLA: You're asking me a question, I'm answering the question. 
HANK JOHNSON: No, no, no. I'm finished with your answer. 
VILLA: Moonlight, Hidden Figures, (INAUDIBLE)-- 
HANK JOHNSON: I'm ready to move on to (INAUDIBLE). 
VILLA: (INAUDIBLE) Call Me by My Name, Greenbook, Bohemian Rhapsody, Roma, I'm answering the question. 
HANK JOHNSON: No. You're not answering the question. 
NADLER: (GAVEL) 
The gentleman controls the time. 
VILLA: These all have people with of color. 
NADLER: (GAVEL) 
The gentleman controls the time. 
HANK JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman--let me, let me digress if you will. 
VILLA: Is this The View or is this Congress? 
HANK JOHNSON: (INAUDIBLE) digress. Ms. Alexander and Ms. Alexander, what was it about the Black Panther movie that-- 
VILLA: Unbelievable. 
HANK JOHNSON: --that was such--that was so profound in your view that made it a blockbuster? 
ALEXANDER: Well, certainly a lot of money was spent to make it and that can make the--the difference sometimes. It was the content that mattered. It was the fact that for many years when Jack Kirby and Stan Lee made that movie it took someone like Christopher Priest to create the characters to jump off the screen (INAUDIBLE) of color to make it the Panther we saw. 
And by the way, budgets can be inherently racist. Not because the--the amount of money you allocate to something should be what you value. So Id lie to say that one of the reasons why it was so fantastic is because we hadn't seen that represented before on screen in that way and everybody went for it black, brown and otherwise. It was an outstanding example that storytelling and representation matters. 
HANK JOHNSON: Thank you. And with that, I yield back. 
NADLER: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Jeffries. 
JEFFRIES: Thank the distinguished chair for holding this very important hearing and for your leadership. I'm proud to represent the 8th Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens and also proud to be the lead democratic cosponsor of the First Step Act which was a bipartisan success of course and exited the House of Representatives as a result of the efforts of many democrats on our side of the aisle. So I'm going to--I'm going to resist the temptation to participate in the charade that some are trying to engage in. I'm going to ask some serious questions because this is a serious issue that we're confronting. 
Ms. Alexander, you've had an extraordinary career. And you've seen a lot of changes, I would assume, that are positive in nature and also some issues that remain to be dealt with and--and so I'd be interested in hearing you know, from you in terms of what--what has improved what remains in desperate need of improvement to this very moment? 
ALEXANDER: Thank you, sir for the question. What has improved is that there are more (INAUDIBLE) who are in positions of power to make the types of shows that can be full of diversity. And that matters because we need to train people to be in those positions. That's not a naturally inherent skills et that people have. And I have to give a shout out to people like Yvette Debauser(PH) and Katory Hall(PH) Lashanda Rymes(PH). 
Those are the showrunners we are talking about. We also should look and invest in culture early on that means funding into arts in schools and making sure that people are aware of how--there is a certain type of discernment coming to the arts, how you think, who you think. We certainly are in--in--in--in favor of diversity of thought. So I'd like to make a shout out and say to anybody that wants to come into this that if you have diversity of thought you should make a show that shows that. If you see that there's a real gap in it please put forward a TV show or a film or something to show your point of view. But that's what could help. We need to train people and we need to make sure the showrunners sand the people are int hose positions including producers are funded. But not only that but we support them. 
JEFFRIES: Now to Mrs. Temple, you've acknowledged that there have been some challenges with the industry you know, over time I think that--that's not surprise because there have been challenges here in America in terms of dealing with the systemic racism, the structural racism as Ms. Alexander has put it--that from my vantage point cause obviously it has been in the soil of this country for 401 years. We have come a long way. We still have a long way to go. 
But in terms of diversity it's not just from my standpoint a feel good thing--isn't Black Panther evidence of the fact that when you reflect diverse perspectives to capture the gorgeous mosaic of the American people that you actually are far more likely to have a productive success in terms of the financial bottom line? 
TEMPLE: Yes. That is--that is exactly right. In fact, the motion picture association is very proud of the fact you know, we do an annual theme report every year which does you now, assess demographics in the theatrical market. And it does show that more diversity in front of the camera is actually a positive thing and that it does actually matter to the bottom line of films. 
Other studies have shown that less diverse films actually do less well in the box office. So this is not an existential issue so to speak. It is one where there are real world benefits to having you know, films that reflect everyone. Because audiences are diverse. Our theme report and other statistics shows that audiences are diverse. That, you know, Latinos are some of our best consumers of films and so they want to be represented in film and should be. And so I think that yes, you are exactly right that this is an issue that really shows how important it is to consider diversity from all perspectives and ensure that our films reflect the society that goes to see our films. 
JEFFRIES: Thank you. Now lastly in the time that I have remaining the death of George Floyd, which he narrated that murder for eight minutes and 46 seconds and cried out for his mother seems to have created an inflection point for many in this country in terms of dealing with the challenges of systemic racism. How has Hollywood responded to that particular moment? 
TEMPLE: You know, I am really proud of--of the way that Hollywood responded to--to that moment, honestly. We all--all of the studios and the motion pictures association stated unequivocally that Black Lives Matter. The Motion Picture Association itself is headquartered on Black Lives Matter Plaza. Our studios have given millions and millions of dollars on racial and social justice issues since the events of this summer. We even supported police reform legislation as well in this very House. So you know, I think this is something that really shows how important it is and how responsible the studios feel as well that they are part of making the society a whole a better place for everyone. 
JEFFRIES: Thank you. My time has expired. 
NADLER: Gentleman yields back Mr. Gar--Ms. Garcia. 
GARCIA: Thank you--thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you so very much. And I can tell you that I was part of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus allegation that did the codel to Hollywood and to the studios last November. And since then, this has been a concern for many of us and Mr. Chairman I really appreciate that you are holding this hearing because it is not just an important topic to Congressional Hispanic Caucus but to all our colleagues here in Judiciary and to many Americans across the nation. 
What we see is important. I can personally tell you that growing up I really did think that everybody dressed in a Mariachi outfit and sang Spanish songs and had a great time in a Hacienda looking--Hacienda looking house. Because the only access I had was a drive-in movie theater that showed Mexican movies. And I always wondered why I didn't look like them because I'm--I'm not as--as dark or--or I have the brown eyes like many of what I saw. So I know that what you see especially for children is very important. 
The film industry is make--is a main narrative creating an image to find an institution of American society and a powerful medium for educating or indoctrinating our citizens. 
Initial basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. This historic hearing comes at a time where studies from major universities have shown us the lack of diversity in Hollywood both in front and behind the camera. 
And I can tell you that unfortunately, Latinos continue to be depicted in very negative stereotypes by and large if we are represented at all. We are either the drug dealers, the illegal immigrants, the aliens, the criminals, or you happen to be a female, you're probably the maid that comes in to ask if they need anything else in a broken English. 
So just last year Latinos made up 4.6 percent of all film roles while white people made up 15.7 percent. In did--in disproportionate comparison to whites who made up 67.3 percent of all films and you all can see that in the chart and Mr. Chairman I do have a copy for the record in a--if I can please get that unanimous consent? Thank you. 
NADLER: (OFF MIC) 
GARCIA: Further, women made up less than 44 percent of film leads, less than 50 percent of film directors and less than 17 percent of film writers. This is especially important because how we portray our underrepresented communities really does matter. Just last week, our nation suffered a great loss with the passing of our esteemed Supreme Court Justice, the Honorable Ruth Bader Ginsberg. She said it best when she (INAUDIBLE) stated ""Women belong in all places where decisions are made. It shouldn't be that women are the exception."" 
Women and people of color do belong in every place and we should not be an exception--not on the screen, not behind the camera and not in the board rooms of any of these studios. We must keep striving for a more perfect union by not only--by not only discussing concrete steps media companies can take to improve representation but also by taking action to address the stereotypical images long portrayed of people of color. 
Our children can't be what they can't see. And we have a responsibility to ensure that the media helps our youth envision the world and the world of possibilities of what they can be. With that in mind I wanted to start with our friend from the--this the studio's association and ask a question. 
When we visited last November we met with Paramount, Universal, Netflix, Disney, Warner and Sony, among others. And one of the things that really disturbed was although they were addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and they knew we were there for diversity inclusion issues many of them couldn't tell us any of the numbers like the numbers up here. So do you make any attempt as an association to work with your studios to make sure that they keep track of the number of films that they make that address some of our concerns today? How many--how many leads are minority, how many people are in the studio in front of the camera, behind the camera, what efforts does your association make? 
TEMPLE: Well, I will say that I mentioned that I mentioned earlier the theme report which is a report that the Motion Picture Association puts out its more broadly on demographics--demographic information about our theatrical releases but it does help make a business ca--case about the importance of diversity because it shows that-- 
GARCIA: But do you actually keep track and file yearly report so that the public can see what you all are--are doing or are not doing? 
TEMPLE: Well, I will say that the studios do participate and support the Annenberg Diversity Initiative and I know so I don't want to speak for the other witness but that does actually provide those (INAUDIBLE). 
GARCIA: Question was what do you as the Association for the studios do to monitor and keep track and report? 
UNKNOWN: (GAVEL) 
Gentlelady's time has expired. The witness may answer the question. 
TEMPLE: As I said, what we do is the theme report which goes into the demographic areas of the theatrical releases and then we support a number of initiatives that are independent reports which I think people actually want in terms of the way that diversity is represented on film. So four studios are partners as I said, with the Annenberg Diversity Initiative. Three executives of our member studios are on the initiative's advisory board. So this is, you know, something that we might not do ourselves but do support others making sure that they have that information to be able to independently review these issues and provide that information to the public. 
GARCIA: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up but I do have another unanimous consent request on a statement from Alma Martinez(PH) who is an accomplished American film, television and theatrical actor. She is a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture of Arts and longtime mentor to up and coming actors. This is a statement she would--about Latinos in Hollywood. That's for unanimous consent. Thank you. I yield back. 
UNKNOWN: Now yield to the distinguished gentlelady from the great state of Florida. Representative Mucarsel-Powell. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all the witnesses for coming. And in talking about I think a very important issue. You now, the media we all know how much the media and the entertainment indu--industry shapes the view of our world. It shapes actually the thoughts of our children and the Americans that they choose to grow up to be. I'm a Latino mother here in South Florida, I have two kids. 
And when I go to a movie theater, when I have them watching shows and they see the Latino community being portrayed I wan them to see a Latino community that they are proud of that they can relate to that reflects who they are. It--it's the same for all the kids living here in my District. I represent a District that is 70 percent Hispanic, 12 to 13 percent African American and yet, when they're watching these films it's very difficult for them to relate. And what happens? They grow up trying to be someone that who they're not because they're just always trying to fit in. 
You know, here in Miami, we also have the largest media companies that serve Latino viewers and listeners in the United States. We have the headquarters for Univision, Telemundo, Caracol, (UNTRANSLATED) those are all Spanish serving you know, broad--media that are broadcasting these shows. And unfortunately, what we're seeing more than anything is that they are not portraying the reality of our diversity in the Latino community. Here in Florida International University our university down here has the only 100 percent Spanish language journalism program in the nation. I don't know why we only have to have one but I'm proud to say it's here in Miami at Florida International University. 
The economic and the media production footprint is enormous. And we understand that so often Hollywood doesn't seem to understand. We understand the importance not just of diversity in the media but also the fair and the positive portrayals in the media. 
The term Latino is very broad. It includes a diverse range of people, cultures, values. We look differently, we speak with different accents--accents. But too often we see one singular stereotype that comes across on TV and film. And one study found that Latinos in the media are primarily portrayed as laborers, law enforcement or criminals. 
Another study, our witness, Dr. Smith worked on actually, found that of the top 200 movies in 2017 and in 2018, one in four Latino characters were shown as criminals. One in eight were shown as poor and over half of the Latinos with jobs had one that did not require a college degree. These are stereotypes that influence a negative perception among the American people and our media industries must take responsibility and recognize the role that they play in shaping our inclusive landscape. I know that one group here in Miami is working for the fair portrayal of Cubans. 
I recently spoke with Eduardo Garcia(PH) of the organization Facts About Cuban Exiles. The group was started in 1982 to defend the image of Cuban exiles and to promote and improve the reputation and image of people of Cuban origin and then their descendants in the United States. Especially, here in Miami. And they began their work after troubling portrayals in mainstream film and the television of that area. So organizations like this are so much needed to raise awareness on these issues. 
I wanted to start with Mr. Olmos--big fan of all your work. I'm so glad to see that you're working on educating our children I think that that's so important. Let--let me ask you how are we--how do you think we need to combat these stereotypes? What can we do? Where do we start? 
OLMOS: We start by understanding what a stereotype is. And the stereotype is a fact a truth but if its' the only thing that you see then it's completely gone to waste. I mean our lives are--its' over for us because basically they only see us one way. And my biggest concern is that our children are watching. So for me, how do we change that? By writing, producing, directing, being behind the camera as well as in front of the camera, taking over and like Tyler Perry--we have to start our own studios and move forward creating our own product. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL: Thank you so much, Mr. Olmos. Quick question to Ms. Temple. Ms. Temple, bringing diversity to the industry is a major issue, but how do we act correct the negative portrayal of Latinos that we see in film all the time? 
TEMPLE: Yes, you know, as I eluded to earlier we agree that there are you know, work needs to be done in this area. I think it's taking a step back and trying to do innovative initiatives to try to address each one of--each one of these issues as we see them. So, for example, University of--Universal Studios recently teamed with the Gina Davis Institute and USC to launch the spellcheck for bias which is a resource that will support Latino represent--representation. They will analyze scripts, manuscripts and advertising briefs to ensure and--and check the representation of characters and the percentage of dialogue. 
So innovative I think, new and proactive initiatives like that are what we need to think about to try to really address this problem. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL: Thank you so much. Chairman, my time is up. I yield back. 
NADLER: Gentlelady yields back. Mr. Armstrong. 
ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (INAUDIBLE) 
JORDAN: Thank the gentleman for yielding. I just wanted to give more witnesses a chance to respond. My understanding when I was at a vote earlier that--that there were some points made, questions raised and--and no ability for Ms. Villa and Mr. Whitlock to respond. That's not unusual for this committee. They did it to the Attorney General. 
So, Ms. Villa, I will give you an oprpoutnity to--to if we can maybe you go a couple of minutes and then, I'll give a couple of minutes to Mr. Whitlock to--to respond to anything that was raised earlier that you would like to respond to. 
VILLA: Excellent. Than you, Mr. Jordan. I want to ask why has nobody brought up China. So China, media giants such as Disney are absolutely taking over human rights abuses by working with China. I mean, they have operated around internment camps in China, Mulan the movie was filmed in China with a gross human--human gross violations against human rights and abuses. Their stance on equality as it per--pertains to the the United States is that they don't' care about it. They're bought out by this--by money and they're owning an American commodity that should be something that American voices can be backed by. 
And we talk about diversity but if we don't have diversity behind the scenes when it comes to making sure that American owned products are American owned then it's going to go to foreign voices and that's a problem. That's a big issue. 
As well, as I wanted to say to respond to Ms. Demings, she Ms. Demings--we brought up Black Lives Matter and then said that well, I don't know what this whole thing is about and proceeded to keep talking. And then I wasn't able to respond. I am going to respond now. I am going to say that it's important for representation of thought. 
DEMINGS: For the record, I did not bring up Black Lives Matter. We talked about we were all over the place in our discussions as opposed (INAUDIBLE). 
VILLA: But your side. The Democrats have been all over the place. I spoke about diversity in media-- 
DEMINGS: --(INAUDIBLE) 
VILLA: The Democrats have brought up this president and then shot down when I attempted to respond. 
JORDAN: Madam Chair, it's my time. I would like an additional 20 seconds at it and--and Ms. Villa can answer a question that was posed to her earlier. And I'd like a couple minutes for Mr.--Mr. Whitlock. 
VILLA: Thank you. So, Ms. Demings, since 2017, Oscar nominations have included Moonlight, Hidden Figures, Loving, Fences, Lion, Call Me by Your Name, Greenbook, Bohemian Rhapsody, Roma, If Bill Street Could Talk, Black Panther. In 2017, a black actor was nominated in every acting category. Hollywood is disproportionately run by Democrats. This is a Democrat run counsel here. This--this event was put on by Democrats. So why can't you guys get it right with diversity? It's because you don't' have Republican representation there. 
DEMINGS: (INAUDIBLE) 
VILLA: It's because you don't talk about diversity of thought. It's because you just want to put people who are black and brown under oh they are black so I'm going to agree with them rather than what products are they bringing to the table. Diversity of thought is the biggest issue here. 
JORDAN: Mr. Whitlock, let me just pose a question to you. There was a New York Times piece in--in from July of this year and the headline read, Are Protests Dangerous? This is relative to COVID--COVID 19 concern, pandemic. Are Protests Dangerous? And then the headline reads--what experts say may depend on who's protesting what. This is how absurd it gets. This is how politically correct it gets. 
You can't get COVID if you're protesting certain left wing approved causes. But if you're protesting conservative causes oh my goodness it's COVID--COVID knows the difference between protesting about not being able to go to church or loved ones funeral or protesting a--about some other issue. This is amazing to me. So you got the last minute and 20 seconds here Mr. Whitlock. 
WHITLOCK: Well, I think my overall point is we can talk about skin color diversity and--and but if everybody has to say the exact same thing because that's what Silicon Valley and the social media matrix that they built dictates what difference does it make what color you are? It--it just doesn't. 
So I've sat and listened throughout the day. We've certainly heard from the Latino community about how they are portrayed in movies. Who's in control of this? And--and for me as a black man I look at the music industry and how black men are portrayed in the music industry. Particularly in hip hop. Who is in control of the music industry? Who is in control of Hollywood? 
It--it's--it's pretty clear that it's the left and--and this is how we are being portrayed int eh music and--and movie industry and no one wants to speak out against it. That's where my frustration comes with talking about the president or things like that. There are just much bigger issues and--and again, I'll just repeat when it comes to skin color diversity there is only one thing you are allowed to say by Hollywood, by the cancel culture group. 
ESCOBAR: Mr. Whitlock? 
WHITLOCK: So it renders color almost irrelevant. 
JORDAN: Thank you. 
ESCOBAR: The gentleman's time has expired. I now yield myself five minutes. I'd like to first thank Chairman Nadler for having this hearing and I want to recognize and thank the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Joaquin Castro for pushing on our committee to have this hearing, this very important hearing today. And I also want to thank members of the Try Caucus. 
There really should be absolutely no question that we've seen an increase in racism in our country. In fact, there has been an increase in hate crimes in our country since 2016. That is the year that then candidate Donald Trump announced that he believed Mexicans are rapists and criminals, described immigrants as an invasion and he essentially announced to the world that it was OK for the highest leader in the land not be a racist. 
When the person with the biggest bully pulpit and the loudest voice who is bolstered by his enablers portrays black and brown people in the most negative light--it matters. And when the media and film industries perpetuate damaging stereotypes it matters. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been working to expose the connection between both the lack of representation of Latinos in the industry and the misrepresentation of who we are with the way that we are perceived by society. 
And I'll tell you--I love films. And for--for many of you who are zooming in I have been big fans for a long time. I love going to the movies. But growing up I remember watching Latinos portrayed as gangsters, maids or undocumented immigrants. I never saw a Latino or Latina portrayed as a member of Congress, which I am so privileged to be today. That portrayal matters. 
Now things have gotten better in the industry but the pace is absolutely unacceptable. When we look back over more than a decade at the data looking at Latino leads and co-leads since 2007 Latino representation is still limited. In 2007 Latinos made up 1 percent of leads and co-leads. 11 years later in 2018 that number is now a whopping 4 percent. Ms. Temple, based on your testimony today it seems like you agree that the industry is in part responsible for societal misperceptions of Latinos would you agree? Historically. 
TEMPLE: I would definitely agree that the portrayal on screen has not been accurate when it becomes--when it comes to persons of colors including Latinos and African Americans and others and that's something that the studios are definitely aware of and working against. One of the ways to do that of course is to ensure that you have diversity in the writing rooms which is a focus that I've talked a lot about some of the initiatives that the studios have to increase diversity in the writers rooms so that again, there are people who will be able to accurately reflect you know, those in front of the cameras. 
I also mentioned a little bit earlier the fact that a number of the studios work with consultants and affiliation groups again to--to address the issue of making sure that portrayals are not stereotypical but that they are instead accurate portrayals and reflect-- 
ESCOBAR: (INAUDIBLE) 
TEMPLE: --the broadness of the community. 
ESCOBAR: I appreciate that and you--you did a good job laying out at the beginning of the hearing in your opening statement the--the work that you all--that the industry is doing. What we have seen especially over this past summer and--and in fact for years now is a reckoning a real reckoning on race. We have seen people hundreds of thousands of Americans marching in the streets, demanding change, demanding action. The--the changes that you outlined while I am so grateful for them and while they are long overdue do you really believe they meet the urgency of this moment? A simple yes or no, please. I'm running out of time. 
TEMPLE: I can't answer yes or no but I can say that we--we agree that more needs to be done and so I don't want to just narrowly say has everything we've done (INAUDIBLE). 
ESCOBAR: Ms. Temple, I'm going to take my time back. I--I simply wanted your opinion, I wanted to know if you believe the industry is meting the urgency of the moment. I personally do not believe it is. Do we have your commitment that in addition to what you have outlined that you will look at accelerating het work that needs to be done in order to meet the urgency of this moment yes or no? 
TEMPLE: Yes. You have my commitment and I'm happy to work with all of the studios to continue this dialogue with you directly. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you, Ms. Temple. We will hold you to that commitment. That concludes today's hearing. We thank all of our witnesses for participating. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. Without objection, the hearing is adjourned. "

(BEGIN AUDIO) 
(END AUDIO) 
RASKIN: This is the fourth hearing our subcommittee has had on the problem of white supremacist and violence in America. 
Since the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, we've also held a separate set of briefings on police brutality in communities of color and rampant violations of the First Amendment at civil rights protests, by the Trump Administration. 
Today, we'll examine how these different threats to the American people intersect-namely, how white supremacist organizations, ideas, and attitudes have come to infiltrate and target certain domains of law enforcement. 
The bloody trail of violent white supremacy is now splattered across America-Charleston, South Carolina, where white supremacist Dylan Roof slaughtered nine African American parishioners at worship in the Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church; Charlottesville, Virginia, where hundreds of neo-Nazi and Klansmen rioted and wounded dozens of people and killed Heather Heyer in a terrible attack by automobile; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where a neo-Nazi killed eleven people and wounded six at the Tree of Life Synagogue, as they worshiped; Poway, California, another anti-Semitic rampage; El Paso, Texas, where a white supremacist hyped up on anti-immigrant hate killed 23 people and wounded 23 others in a rampage at a Walmart. 
According to the Anti-Defamation League, 75 percent of all extremist-related murders between 2009 and 2018, were committed by right-wing extremists. The Center for Strategic Studies, which analyzed over 900 politically motivated attacks in the U.S. since 1994, found that there have been nearly six times as many victims of violence from right-wing groups, as from others. In 2020, they found that over 90 percent of political attacks were conducted by right-wing groups. These are the facts. 
Like COVID-19, this virus of violent white supremacy is spreading. The Southern Poverty Law Center documented a record 30 percent increase in the number of hate groups, nationwide, over the last several years, and hate crimes are also trending up. But as with COVID-19, the Trump Administration has decided to mislead the public, by downplaying the problem. A Department of Homeland Security whistleblower has stated that Ken Cuccinelli told him to specifically modify draft language on white supremacy to make, quote, ""the threat appear less severe,"" and to ""include information on the prominence of violent left-wing groups."" 
The spread of violent white supremacy is a threat to everyone but, disproportionately, it is a threat to black and brown communities. But it is also a threat, and purposefully underestimating this problem is a threat, to first responders-in this case, to police officers. According to the Anti-Defamation League, white supremacists and other far right extremist groups have killed 51 police officers, since 1990. Eighty three percent of shootouts between police and extremists involve right-wing extremists, with white supremacists being responsible for more than half of those. 
The unredacted memo we released today from the FBI, states that, quote, ""White supremacist presence among law enforcement personnel is a concern, due to the access they may have to restricted areas vulnerable to sabotage and to elected officials or protected persons that they could see as targets for violence."" White supremacy is a deadly threat to the safety of law enforcement officers, as well as to public safety, generally. 
In May, far right extremists killed David Patrick Underwood, a federal law enforcement officer. One of the Boogaloo boys charged in Underwood's death is a former Air Force sergeant also suspected in the murder of a Santa Cruz Sheriff, earlier this year. In February, a white supremacist killed Officer Nick O'Rear, in Alabama. 
In 2006, the FBI released an intelligence assessment warning of, quote, ""White supremacist infiltration of law enforcement."" The FBI identified two distinct problems. First, the FBI noted the problem of white supremacist groups infiltrating law enforcement. 
We've seen a lot of evidence of that in the fourteen years since the FBI's assessment, as officers across the country have been dismissed for active membership in the KKK and other similar groups. We will hear testimony about this problem, today. But the FBI also identified a second problem, law enforcement officers who have no formal affiliation with racist groups but who sympathize with their racist ideology. This, too, has been in plain view in this period of resurgent racist violence, across America. 
In 2019, a team of investigative journalists published the Plain View Project, which collected over 5,000 postings displaying white supremacist, xenophobic, misogynistic and violent Facebook material from police officers in eight different cities. 
We invited the FBI to come, today. The bureau refused to come, claiming it has nothing to say because they have no evidence that this is a widespread problem demanding the FBI's attention. What's more, they have attempted to disavow their own 2006 intelligence assessment, which has every sign of being an authentic document. They did provide us an unredacted version of that 2006 assessment, which I am releasing today so the public can better understand how the FBI understood this threat and judge its subsequent actions, or lack thereof, accordingly. 
The redacted passages include prescient warnings for the American people. The FBI warned that, quote, ""white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement can result in abuses of authority and passive tolerance of racism within communities served."" The FBI also cautioned that police officers who are hostile to civil rights might, quote, ""Volunteer their professional resources to the white supremacist causes with which they sympathize."" 
These are chilling conclusions, but rather than clearly spell out this threat for the American people, the FBI has suppressed them from public view, for 14 years. For the first time, we can now see that the FBI believed, internally, that white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement departments was a serious problem, a source of potential abuse of power and authority on the street, and a source of potential violence against the civilian population. 
This summer, as the country was shocked to watch videos depicting the brutal and vindictive treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters, other videos emerged of police officers treating armed white militia as friends and as allies. In Salem, Oregon, police gave a polite warning to a group of armed white men asking them to discreetly stay inside the buildings after curfew so it would not look like police were playing favorites when they teargassed protesters. 
In Albuquerque, officers were caught on a police scanner referring to white vigilantes as ""armed friendlies."" In Kenosha, Wisconsin, officers pushed protestors towards a group of armed, white civilians. Police offered water to those armed men, one of whom shot and killed two people that night. The shooter, Kyle Rittenhouse, got away, despite walking up to police with his hands in the air, the murder weapon strapped to his chest, while onlookers identified him as the killer of two innocent Americans. 
The social contract depends on fair and neutral enforcement of the laws to protect the whole citizenry against criminal violence and state violence. We must work to disentangle the police power of the state from groups and individuals that subscribe to violent white supremacist ideology and seek to inflict harm on African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Jewish Americans, LGBTQ Americans, and anyone who stands in the way of a race war and the civil war that the extreme right is calling for in America, today. 
If local or state law enforcement were being infiltrated by ISIS or by Al-Qaeda, or any other terrorist group, we would consider it an immediate public safety emergency. Infiltration by violent white supremacy is no less of a threat and no less urgent. To confront it effectively, we must understand it. That is the purpose of today's hearing. 
So, I now would like to recognize the distinguished Ranking Member, Mr. Roy of Texas, for an opening statement. 
I went a bit over my time there, Mr. Roy, so please feel to take the equal amount of time that you need. 
ROY: Well, I appreciate the Chairman. The Chairman is always gracious to make sure that we have equal time and handle that in that respect and so I appreciate that and good to see it from afar. 
As you know, this hearing is the fourth in our series on white supremacy and we've had a number of good exchanges and dived into some of the facts over the course of previous three hearings, and I certainly think it's important for us to do so. 
As you remember, I was particularly moved and wanted to understand the situation in Charlottesville. As a University of Virginia graduate, obviously, that hit close to home and talking to a mother who lost her daughter sitting there in the downtown mall in Charlottesville where I used to go as a student and seeing this horrid series of events unfold, it was important for us to have that conversation and I think it's important for us to have this conversation. I would note and the chairman knows. I mean, I've been asking repeatedly for the last year for us to have a hearing, for example, on human trafficking. 
There's 40,000,000 people around the world suffering from human trafficking, some 20,000 in the United States where we had actual law enforcement engagement with them, which is a small, is a fraction of what we know is actually occurring in the United States; estimates of up to 300,000 or 400,000. I think we should find time on our schedule for hearings on matters such as that. 
As the chairman well knows, I think it's an important issue and if you think about 300,000 or 400,000 people that are estimated to be engaged, or to be the victims of human trafficking in the United States at any given moment. We ought to look at that. 
And you know, look, I think we have to ask a question., You know, why is this now the fourth in a series of hearings. And I don't question the motives of the chairman but I would have to acknowledge that it is fairly facially obvious, over the last, you know, X number of months, that my Democratic colleagues really want to perpetrate a narrative that American law enforcement is either systemically racist or composed of white supremacists. And I just, categorically, reject that characterization of the almost 800,000 law enforcement personnel who are standing up on the thin blue line for each and every one of us, every day. As a former federal prosecutor, I firmly believe we root out crime, wherever we find it. We root it out. And we root out hate, we root out racism, wherever we find it. That is our job to go pursue it. 
I wholly agree with that. But it is a dangerous path--it is a dangerous path that my Democratic colleagues are pursuing in defining our law enforcement personnel as systemically racist. And that's what's happening, that's what these things are doing, that's what this focus is doing. And by the way, it wouldn't matter if this hearing was just focused--that this hearing is just focused on law enforcement. My Democratic colleagues have made it abundantly clear that the United States of America is, in and of itself, systemically racist. That's the position of the modern Democratic Party, that our nation is systemically racist. And that to me, is fundamentally at odds with what this nation, actually, has stood for and what this nation, actually, has done. 
Look, I come from a family with a history in law enforcement. My great, great grandfather was a Texas Ranger in the county in which I'm sitting, right now, in the 1870s, in Travis County, Hays County and Blanco County. And I'm proud of that. My grandfather was the Chief of Police of a small West Texas town, Sweetwater, Texas. He died of cancer when my dad was seven. My dad barely knew him because he just came back from the war. By all accounts, by everybody I talked to, my grandfather was a good, faithful public servant, who was not racist in any way. Everything I understand from my family, my grandmother. When my grandmother was a single mom in West Texas, the county, first woman County click elected in Nolan County, Texas when my grandfather died of cancer. 
And I stand by my grandfather. I stand by all law the enforcement officers that I worked with when I was the Assistant United States Attorney, working in the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Texas. All of the fine law enforcement officers who worked for me of varying races when I was the first Assistant Attorney General. And you know, when I was the first Assistant Attorney General for Attorney General Ken Paxton here in Texas, we have 4,100 employees. I will wholly acknowledge that, irrespective of race for a moment, if one percent of those 4,100 are doing anything crazy, insane, mean, hateful, racist, illegal, at any given moment, one percent of that 4,100, that's 41 people. And my job, as the first Assistant Attorney General was to go track these things down, have internal investigations, go look and figure out what's happened. 
I wholeheartedly embrace and believe in that but when we, the institution of Congress, make blanket statements using viral videos to define a class of human beings standing on that wall for us, every day, I'm troubled by that. There is a significant amount of evidence out there that suggests that there is not structural bias in the criminal justice system regarding arrests, prosecutions, or sentencing. Crime and suspect behavior, not race, determine most police actions. There are 70 million interactions, roughly--I mean, obviously, these are estimates--70 million interactions between law enforcement and civilians, every year. 
Now, if a million of those are, you know, troubling, problematic, for varying different reasons, one of which might be race, one of which almost certainly is race, then we should root that out. But when you then, categorically, define 70 million police interactions with 800,000 law enforcement personnel, as systemically racist, then you're undermining our entire rule of law, right. I mean, we're seeing this unfold, right now, in front of us. You know, the past few months have brought police into the limelight and sparked a resurgence of anti-law enforcement rhetoric from the left and many in the media. And what has been the result-more violence in our streets, more police officers killed in the line of duty. 
More Americans, many of them in low income communities are suffering because their communities are crumbling at the hands of lawless mobs. They can't use the bus stop, they can't--to take them across town to get to work because somebody smashed it to pieces. They can't get a loaf of bread from their local corner store because looters ransacked it, forced the owner to close shop for good, the owner of a shop that's been in their family for years is now gone. Forty five percent of black owned businesses have been decimated, since the beginning of both the virus and all of the unrest on our streets. 
There are real consequences to what's going on our streets. In many cases, they cannot call the police for help. Just yesterday, there was a thing that went around here in Austin where somebody was running through the Whole Foods in downtown Austin, where everybody's getting their little lattes and buying some arugula for their salads. Somebody's running through and they're worried about it and they call the police. Well guess what, there's no police to get there. Why? Because the Austin City Council in its leftist infinite wisdom has slashed the police department, by a third. 
Look, data shows that when police backlash, based on these false narratives, follows the release of a viral video, law enforcement tends to be less aggressive in pursuing perpetrators, resulting in an increase in crime and homicide of which victims include all races. In the two weeks following the death of Mr. Floyd, more than 700 police officers were injured. Many lives were lost and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to private businesses and public property have been made. Across 20 major cities, the murder rate at the end of June was an average 37 percent higher than it was at the end of May--the murder rate. These are people, these are murders. And what about the police officer shootings with the intent to kill that we recently saw in Los Angeles and Louisville in the name of defending social justice. There's two officers killed in Louisville, at least one of whom was black. 
Defending the police creating broad false narratives about law enforcement and encouraging violence in our streets in the name of politics is harming our communities. You can't defund the police. For example, for total homicides, year-over-year, for the 15 largest US cities, Austin, the district that I represent, ranks first at 64 percent increase. And just a few months ago, the city of Austin, as I said before, defunded one third of the police department. More examples from Austin-43 percent increase in murder, 17 percent increase in aggravated assault, 30 percent increase in statutory rate, 24 percent increase in arson, 5 percent increase in vandalism. Notably, due to their defending, they canceled the 144 Austin police department cadet class, the most diverse cadet class for the department in its history, half of the graduates were minorities. 
They canceled it. It's gone, all those people who wanted to serve law enforcement, who wanted to serve in the community, wanted to help protect their community. Again, over half minorities, that class is gone. At least 46 police officers have been killed in the line of duty, this year. I read all of their names on the floor of the House of Representatives, last week. Where the hell is the NBA wearing their names on the back of their jerseys? Where in the hell is the outrage for the law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, standing up on that thin blue line for us? 
Twenty-four-year-old officer, Katherine Mary Thyne who was dragged by a car and pinned against a tree-dead. Police officer Bryan Brown who was also killed in vehicular assault-gone. Sergeant Damon Gutzwiller who was ambushed, shot and killed, gone. Twenty-four-year-old officer Breann Leath, who was shot in open fire, responding to a domestic disturbance-gone; just to name a few. 
We already have an over 50 percent increase of felonious officers killed in the line of duty with three remaining months left, this year. But cities around the nation are defunding their police department. This committee, in my opinion, is giving a platform to harmful narratives, including the very idea of safe streets, while hurting our communities. Safety and security should be non-negotiable to this body, non-negotiable to me as a father, as a Texan and, especially, as a member of Congress. I think, Mr. Chairman, I understand what we're doing here in the conversation we're having, and these are important conversations. But we ought to be mindful of those 800,000 men and women who are going to suit up today to stand on that line for us. 
And I'm always entertained by those who are out on the streets and something happens and there's violence because they're out at some protest and the next thing you know they go, ""Where are the police?"" 
That's happened to members of this body. They were looking around, ""Where are the police?"" Well I guaran-damn-tee you that the thing that we're going to be asking is, ""Where are the police,"" if we continue to go after and assault them and blanketly condemn them as racists, as an institution of racism, as opposed to doing our lawful duties, members of Congress, or as law enforcement officers, to go root out every single crime, every single action, one case at a time. 
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
RASKIN: Mr. Roy, thank you very much for your thoughtful remarks and I hope I get a chance to respond to some of the things, a bit later. 
One thing I do want to say for right now, is there is nothing in anything that I said and there's nothing about this hearing which describes all of law enforcement as racist or a racist threat. On the contrary, my whole opening was about how violent white supremacy is a threat to the public interest, including to law enforcement, itself. But I think we'll be able to discuss this more with the witnesses, as they come through. And I thank you for your remarks. 
With that, I'm going to recognize the chair of the Oversight Committee, Ms. Maloney, for her opening statement. Please unmute, if you would. We're not hearing Ms. Maloney. 
MALONEY: Unmute-call him and tell him we have got technical problems. 
RASKIN: No, we've got you now, Madam Chair, we've got you. 
MALONEY: Okay. First of all, I want to start by thanking my good friend, Chairman Raskin, for convening this important and timely hearing. 
The subcommittee has already held three hearings focused on violent white supremacy. And Chairman Raskin's leadership on this issue has been inspiring. As Chairman Raskin said, racism is not new to America. It is, particularly, not new to black Americans. Since our nation's founding, racism has been used to treat black Americans as second-class citizens or no class citizens. We must never forget that policing in America started with slave patrols. Many slave patrols evolved into police departments that, for decades, have been used to ensure black Americans could not exercise their full rights, as citizens. 
We are dealing with that legacy, today. Many police departments face the continued infiltration of white supremacists into their ranks. As the FBI found, and I quote, ""Militia extremists, white supremacist extremists and sovereign citizen extremists often have identified active links to law enforcement officers."" This year, we have seen millions of people march in the streets. They are asking for the end of state sanctioned killings and calling for the dismantling of systemic injustice. Their mission is straightforward. They are asking for the bare minimum, that our nation be a place where the lives and deaths of black Americans matter. But those protests have been met with violence and, in many instances, police sanctioned violence by white extremist groups. 
This hearing is not about good officers versus bad officers. This hearing is about making sure we, as a nation, acknowledge that white supremacy has no place in any police department. The idiom does not end with, quote, ""a few bad apples."" The saying is, ""A few bad apples spoil the bunch. We cannot let white supremacy continue to spoil the bunch. Instead, we should all condemn the behavior that Chairman Raskin described. I am honored to attend this hearing. It is shameful, absolutely shameful that the FBI chose to ignore the committee's request to attend and instead, disavowed their own terrifying findings about the pervasiveness of white supremacy in police departments. 
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about their extremely important work and I hope we remember the wise words of Chairman Cummings that, ""We are better than this."" And I yield back. Thank you. 
RASKIN: Madam Chair, thank you very much. I now want to introduce our witnesses. 
Our first witness, today, is going to be Michael German, who is a Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. Then Vida Johnson, who's an Associate Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law School, just a few blocks from the Capitol. 
We'll also hear from Frank Meeink, an author and an activist. Then, we'll hear from Mark Napier, who is the Sheriff of Pima County, Arizona. And finally, we'll hear from Heather Taylor, who is the president of the Ethical Society of Police in St. Louis. 
The witnesses will now please unmute, so I can swear you in. 
Please, all of you, raise your right hands, if you would. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
UNKNOWN: I do. 
RASKIN: Thank you. Let the record show that the witnesses have all answered in the affirmative. Thank you and, without objection, your complete written statements will be made part of the record. 
You are given five minutes, within which to give your oral presentation and then, all of the distinguished members of the committee who have arrived, including Ms. Tlaib, who's just joined the subcommittee, are going to ask you questions. 
With that, Mr. German, you are now recognized for five minutes. 
GERMAN: --and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify, today, about white supremacists and far right militant activity in law enforcement. 
In 1992, when I was an FBI agent preparing to go undercover against neo-Nazi skinhead groups in Los Angeles, my colleagues warned that white supremacists often have relations with law enforcement and that I would have to strengthen my undercover identity to withstand law enforcement scrutiny. 
I worked closely in that operation and in a later one investigating far right militias in Washington state with officers from several different federal and local law enforcement agencies, who typically had more experience than I did. None suggested this was not a reasonable concern. So, I was not surprised when the FBI released its 2006 intelligence assessment entitled ""White Supremacist Infiltration of Law Enforcement"" that alerted agents to this infiltration by organized groups and, ""by self-initiated infiltration by law enforcement personnel sympathetic to white supremacist causes"" as it was the same warning I received a decade earlier. 
A late 2015 FBI counterterrorism policy guide makes the case more directly. It warns agents that FBI domestic terrorism investigations focused on militia extremists, white supremacist extremists and sovereign citizen extremists, often have active links with law enforcement officers. But when Representative William Lacy Clay asked the FBI counterterrorism chief, Michael McGarity, whether the bureau remained concerned about white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement since the publication of the 2006 assessment, at a June, 2019, hearing of this subcommittee, Mr. McGarrity indicated he had not read it. Asked more generally about this infiltration, McGarrity said he would be suspect of white supremacist police officers, but their ideology was a first amendment protected right. 
The 2006 assessment addresses this concern, however, by summarizing Supreme Court precedent on the issue. Quote, ""Although the First Amendment's freedom of association provision protects individuals right to join white supremacist groups for the purpose of lawful activity, the government can limit the employment opportunities of group members who hold sensitive public sector jobs, including jobs within law enforcement, when their membership would interfere with their duties."" 
More importantly, the FBI's 2015 counterterrorism policy, which McGarrity was responsible for executing, indicates not just that members of law enforcement might hold white supremacist views, but that domestic terrorism investigations have often identified ""active links"" between the subjects of these investigations and law enforcement officials. It' proposed remedy is stunningly inadequate, however. It simply instructs agents to protect their investigations by using the silent hit feature of the Terrorist Screening Center watchlist, so that police officers cannot ascertain whether they were under FBI scrutiny. Of course, one doesn't need access to secret FBI terrorism investigations to find evidence of explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with connections to white supremacist groups or far right militant activities, have been exposed in more than a dozen states, around the country. 
Research organizations have uncovered hundreds of the federal, state, and local law enforcement officials participating in racist, nativist and sexist social media activity, which demonstrates that overt bias is too common. Law enforcement officials actively affiliating with white supremacist and far right militant groups pose a serious threat to people of color, religious minorities, LGBTQ people, and anti-racist activists. But the police response to protests following the murder of George Floyd includes a number of law enforcement officers across the country, flaunting their affiliation with far right militant groups. 
Police officers casually fraternizing with armed far right militia groups at protests is confounding because many states, including California, Illinois and Pennsylvania, have laws that bar unregulated paramilitary activities. And far right militants have often killed police officers. As the chairman stated, the ADL has reported that far right militants had killed 51 police officers from 1990 to 2018. 
The ambush shooting, bombing and killing of federal law enforcement officers in Oakland and a local sheriff's deputy in Santa Cruz County, California, by far right militants, highlights the threat that police engagement with these groups pose to their law enforcement partners. My written testimony includes detailed recommendations to Congress for prosecutors and for federal, state and local law enforcement. And I look forward to your questions. Thank you. 
RASKIN: Thank you very much for your testimony, Mr. German. Professor Johnson, you are recognized for your five minutes of testimony. 
JOHNSON: Thank you to the subcommittee members and to Chairman Raskin, Chairman Maloney and Ranking Member Roy for the honor of speaking with you, today. 
My name is Vida Johnson. I am an Associate Professor of Law at Georgetown Law and I write about criminal procedure and policing. Before I begin, I want to make clear that I believe that the vast majority of people who become police officers do so for all the right reasons, including members of my own family. But nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that there's a long history of explicit racism on police departments. And sadly, this legacy of racism continues, today. Our nation is one of the most diverse in the world and our officers need to be able to protect and serve everyone in our community. 
In 2006, the FBI warned of white supremacists trying to infiltrate police departments. The Department of Homeland Security warned in 2009 that white supremacists were recruiting former military personnel and called it one of the biggest domestic terrorism threats in the United States. Warning from these agencies went unheeded. In 2014, members of a police department in Florida were outed as members of the KKK. In 2015, an Alabama officer was identified as being a member of the League of the South. In 2017, an Oklahoma police chief was discovered to be one of the most influential white supremacists in the country. In 2019, a prospective homebuyer toured a Michigan officer's home and saw a framed KKK application. 
In addition to officers who identify with these types of groups, some officers hold explicitly racist views without any hate group affiliation. The Department of Justice reports on Ferguson and Chicago make plain that officers used the ""N"" word, along with other disparaging remarks about people of color in the communities they police. And of course, this year in Wilmington North Carolina, white officers were caught on tape looking forward to a race war and dreaming of wiping black people off the map. Texting scandals involving officers in San Francisco and Miami make clear that this is a problem, nationwide. 
In my 2019 Law Review article, KKK in the PD, I compiled accounts of 178 instances of explicit racial bias found in news stories. We know that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Some officers aren't so careless as to end up on the news but still hold these views. And confidentiality statutes in many states make issue of police discipline private so they don't make the news. And of course, the blue wall of silence keeps many of these officers on the force because others fail to report them for their explicitly racist views. 
We care about this problem because racist views can translate into racist deeds. We know that officers, disproportionately, stop people of color and of course, we worry most about violence. We know that the biggest torture scandal of policing involved John Burge, whose midnight crew in Chicago extracted confessions from over 100 African American men with the use of cattle prods and other torture. An officer in Little Rock, Arkansas, was honest when he applied to a Police Department that he had attended a Klan rally. He was hired, anyway. He later went on to shoot and kill a 15-year-old unarmed black boy. So, what are some solutions to this terrible problem? A more expansive view of Brady versus Maryland, if that were codified, we might come to a to ferret out some of these officers. 
Brady versus Maryland is the Supreme Court case that makes clear that the government must turn over any information that is favorable to the accused and that includes information that impeaches a witness's credibility. Information in police possession is imputed to prosecutors. What would this look like? Prosecutors would have to investigate their officers and turn that information over for use at a public trial. 
Other solutions will include better background checks in hiring of officers, zero-tolerance policies, searches of officer emails and texts for keywords associated with racial animus, social media policies in which officers agree as a condition of hiring to allow social media searches, and federal licensing of officers which would allow for better screening of preventing officers from going from one from one department to another. 
We must weed out officers who hold racist beliefs, rather than sweep them under the rug. 
I'm happy to take any questions. 
RASKIN: Professor Johnson, thank you very much. I now recognize Mr. Meeink for his five minutes of testimony. 
MEEINK: Good morning. Thank you. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Frank Meeink. I'm a former white supremacist and neo-Nazi gang member. After I served my time in prison in 1994, I decided to leave the skinhead movement, now, with the antibodies to the virus of hate. I spent the last 25 years speaking out against racism. I conducted hate crimes training for police officers, FBI and Homeland Security agents. I volunteered with the Des Moines Police Department as an announcer at their annual fundraising hockey game. I am also an activist for Black Lives Matter--Black Lives Matter. 
I've spoken out about the fact that white supremacist leaders encourage their followers to join the police force as a means to cause harm to people of color. I was there when it was said. I was in the room where it happened. I am here to bear witness to my own experience. I grew up in a lower middle-class, tough Irish Catholic neighborhood in South Philadelphia. I had a mother who was a drug addict and an abusive stepfather. I feared going home so much that, some days, I tried to get hit by car. 
At the age of 13, I was kicked out of my mom's home and moved to live with my dad, who lived in a mixed very rough neighborhood in Southwest Philadelphia. I was the new kid, a skinny punk rock white boy at an all-black middle school. This is where my fear turned to hate. That summer, I went off to visit my cousin in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This is Amish country and although my family was not Amish, and I promise you there's no Amish neo-Nazis, I thought my cousin and his friends were cool. They were older. They were neo-Nazis. I would hear them make racist comments, even though they'd never spent any time around black people. When they heard where I went to school, I became the urban, inner-city expert. And I began to feel I mattered. 
The day that I decided to join this movement was the day I saw other people fear my group of friends. I saw them as powerful. Up until that point, I might be a teenager but inside, I was a seven-year-old scared little boy who feared everything. I feared my parents, my stepparents, my school. I feared if I was going to have enough food to eat. I wanted people to fear me. So, I became a member of the neo-Nazi movement. I got a swastika tattooed on my neck to prove my undying loyalty. I joined the movement for survival, which made me grasp on to every word that was said in the room. And here's what I heard. 
In 1991, I attended a meeting run by the White Student Union at Temple University. This was a monthly meeting of about 15 to 20 members. They were mostly guys, so they were career minded. They would use words--they would say to us that we need to grow out our hair, stop getting tattoos and get ready to go into the military or police. Two people that were at that meeting later on became cops. That same year, I attended a small meeting in Baltimore, run by the National Socialist Movement and a group called SS Action. I heard the same rhetoric there. They told us to join law enforcement, so we can give black people felonies, so they would not be able to legally arm themselves and they would not be able to vote. 
Later in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, I attended a Hitler birthday party. This was put on by the Christian Posse Comitatus and at that party, Mark Thomas talked to us about how he was happy with our numbers. We had a lot of members. But he thought we were too rowdy. He said we needed to chill out and get rid of our tattoos and be better soldiers for the movement. Mark Thomas held Bible studies, regularly. We would all gather inside these military tents and in his back yard and we would read the Bible, shoot some guns and prepare to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. This experience was meant to militarize us and push us to gain more professional training in law enforcement. 
In 1992, I attended a meeting of about 100 people in Montgomery, Alabama. This meeting was run by the Aryan Youth Front, where Bill Riccio urged us to join the military so we can get real training. In late 1992, I went to Aryan Fest in a desert town in California. At the time, I still had a big swastika tattooed on my neck. Many people made comments about me and that I need to get rid of it and grow out my hair because we need all of our people to join the military and or police. The fact that many of these neo-Nazis became cops, means there is something not right with the screening process in law enforcement. And I believe it is possible to fix. 
I hope that by me speaking out today, and with God's help, we can at least start stitching this wound in America and stop just putting Band-Aids on it. Breonna Taylor mattered. Black lives matter. Thank you. 
RASKIN: Mr. Meeink, thank you very much for your compelling testimony. And Sheriff Napier, you are now recognized for your five minutes of testimony. 
NAPIER: Good morning. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the subcommittee, this morning, and I thank you for that. My name is Mark Napier. I am the Sheriff of Pima County, Arizona. 
The law enforcement profession shares the concern that any bad actors may infiltrate its ranks. Moreover, we share community outrage at the conduct of a very few members of our profession when they act out with violence and racial animus. However, these are the actions of a very, very few members of law enforcement. Every day, in communities large and small, thousands of law enforcement officers make over a million contacts with the public that result in no use of force or give rise to the appearance of any racial bias. In point of fact, most public contacts with law enforcement are the results of a call for service. 
The law enforcement profession makes every effort to weed out bad actors. Our hiring and training process is rigorous. Prior to employment, we conduct comprehensive background investigations, oral interviews, polygraphs and written examinations. 
Today, we even scan social media, looking for troubling posts and questionable associations. Successful candidates then go through extensive academy training. This training includes cultural awareness training, racial bias training and use of force training. On completion of academy training, new officers go through field training where he or she is evaluated and observed by a tenured high-performing officer. 
At the conclusion of field training, the new officer's on a probationary period for one year, during which time his or her performance is reviewed and observed by a field supervisor. The officer is then evaluated for the duration of his or her career. We take every step possible to weed out bad actors and bad candidates and then to professionally train, observe and evaluate our officers, throughout their career. 
It would be dishonest to suggest that bad actors do not slip through, despite our best efforts. However, this is not unique to law enforcement. Every profession risks the prospect of a bad actor infiltrating its ranks and tarnishing its standing. These isolated occurrences, for any profession, should not be used as an indictment of its entire membership or as a catalyst to assert that the isolated bad acts are evidence of systemic prevalence. 
As Americans, we do not believe the bad acts of a few members of any group provides justification for bias and stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination against all members of that group. This is always wrong, even when it's cast toward law enforcement officers. I've been a law enforcement officer since 1981. I hold a bachelor's degree in social psychology and a master's degree in criminal justice. I do understand the manifestations of both, over and implicit racial bias. Moreover, I believe that racism, discrimination and social economic inequality still exists in our country and constitute a serious problem. 
Racism has been a scar on our country since its founding and I believe it is still alive, today. During my three-decade career in law enforcement, I have not found any evidence to make me believe that racism or white supremacy is systemic and systemic is a very important word in our profession. Assertions, to the contrary, I believe to be false, not out of naivete, ignorance, or a lack of personal exposure to the profession. Rather, because I have simply not been exposed to any evidence that would lead me to reasonably believe that systemic racism and infiltration of white supremacy into the profession which I've dedicated nearly four decades of my life to, is present in modern day law enforcement. 
Again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the subcommittee, this morning. And I welcome any questions that any members might have. Thank you. 
RASKIN: Sheriff Napier, thank you very much for your testimony, today, and for joining us. Finally, we will hear from Heather Taylor, the president of the Ethical Society of Police of St. Louis, Missouri. And Ms. Taylor, you are recognized for your five minutes of an opening statement. 
TAYLOR: Thank you for having me, this morning. 
I would like to start off, once again, my name is Heather Taylor. I recently retired, last Friday. I was a 20-year veteran of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. I was a Detective Sergeant in the homicide section. However, I'm speaking on behalf of the Ethical Society of Police. The Ethical Society of Police was founded in 1972 to fight racial discrimination in our community and our police department. 
We have approximately 325 members in the St. Louis City, St. Louis County and Ferguson area. We are, roughly, 97 percent African American. I'm here to give my perspective on white supremacy ideologies and white supremacist sympathizers in law enforcement. The FBI report from 2006 about ""White Supremacists Infiltration in Law Enforcement,"" the Plainview Project, which affected our police department greatly, which exposed racist content by police officers and numerous other reports are clear examples that we have a problem with white supremacy and racism in law enforcement. 
I want to provide my perspective by telling a true story. For nearly seven years, I have repeatedly reported an officer for his racism. I learned this officer had a penchant for making racist statements about black people on social media. He once stated, ""Black people are pathetic."" He also cheered a black man being shot in the head, posting, ""You can take him out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of him."" 
A black woman accused him of saying, ""only prostitutes and drug dealers own Bentleys."" Another time, he made a racist statement about black people and welfare. This officer was also reported for racial profiling, by a citizen. He's also a field training officer, training hundreds of officers, within our police department. He's never been fired for these statements and these complaints, despite people like myself, who's a sworn officer, and citizens making these complaints. 
These statements were not the worst of his actions. This officer and other officers killed a black man under questionable circumstances, in 2012. I was a scene investigator on that case. That case haunts me to this day. They used a banned chokehold. Another officer tased this man six times--six times. The officer violated numerous policies. A witness said that one of the officers used the ""N"" word during this incident. Others stated the victim resisted arrest. The use of the ""N"" word, all witness' statements related to me, all questionable actions by the officers, were placed in a police report, an official document. 
The report was turned over to the Internal Affairs Division for review for criminal charges or discipline. I was told the officers were returned to full duty. No charges were filed but I just couldn't believe it so I delivered a copy of the police report to the Circuit Attorney's Office in 2013, once after the case was finally done. I just couldn't believe that there were no charges, there was nothing. To this day, I don't know if a Grand Jury ever reviewed the case for any form of charges. I don't know the discipline of that case. In 2020, this same officer that used that banned chokehold made this insensitive Facebook post about another black man. This time, it was George Floyd. It was about chokeholds and his belief that George Floyd's murder was justified. 
I believe more extensive background checks are necessary, when hiring. I believe the immediate termination and removal of police certifications of officers that support white supremacy that are corrupt in any way, that these officers should be removed, immediately. And it is clear and anyone says, anyone saying that you can train away racism, they're wrong. You cannot train away racism, you just can't. You need to weed it out. You need to fire them and terminate them, if they're officers. 
I also believe that whistleblower protections need to become a priority. I've risked my life by reporting the officers. I've received death threats from officers, officers liking the idea of me bleeding out on a call by myself. It's impossible to break the blue coat of silence if there are no protections in place that empowers officers to come forward. I would like to also state that in 2017, a black officer, Milton Green, who grew up in the inner-city, survived, became an officer, he was shot in 2017 by a white officer. There were racial undertones about that incident. That was in 2017. 
Three months later, Detective Luther Hall was brutally beaten, in his own words, like Rodney King, by four white St. Louis city police officers. Those officers have been federally indicted. I would also like to state that COVID-19 is the leading cause of death for police officers, and suicide. The leading cause of death. We are losing officers by COVID-19 and suicide. We have had 45 officers this year, unfortunately, including officer Tamarris Bohannon who was shot and killed, that have been shot and killed or died by force, use of force. 
I think it's important to address that sympathizing with white supremacy is a problem within our law enforcement communities. And that is a reality. And what we see with the officer that I'm speaking about in my example is that he is a field training officer, he's training other officers to become officers. There's no way that he should have been allowed to continue in this field 
I would also like to add in this that there was a recent study by the City Group that listed that $16 trillion is a result of racism in our country--$16 trillion. That's what we have, as a result of racism in our country. And that includes law enforcement and the settlements that have been made regarding racist officers and sympathizers within our police department. 
I welcome any statements or any questions. Thank you. 
RASKIN: Thank you very much, Sergeant Taylor. And with that, we've completed our witness testimony and we will enter upon questions. I now will recognize myself as chair, for five minutes of questioning. 
I want to start with Professor Johnson. To trust the First Amendment implications of this because I know that there are Supreme Court decisions that say that you can't discriminate against people in public hiring, based on what their political ideology is. 
But I wonder if you would speak to the speech conduct distinction and some of the things, for example, that Sergeant Taylor just talked about, in terms of officers letting their beliefs influence their actions on the job, either towards citizens or towards fellow officers. 
JOHNSON: Sure, I'd be happy to answer that question. So, I think it's important to note that public servants are limited, in terms of their speech in a lot of ways. And that's true for federal employees, judges. There's all sorts of ways that we limit the speech of public servants. 
And there have been court decisions, most notably, by the second circuit that say that, when an officer's speech is at odds with the police department's interest in having the trust of the community, that the interests of the police department outweigh the First Amendment concerns of the police officers. 
There was a famous case that took place in New York City about officers who had been on a fluke in expressing very ways to stereotypes. And ultimately, the second circuit ruled that those officers could be legally terminated. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Professor Johnson. Mr. German, dozens of officers have been killed by white supremacists, as you point out. The unredacted FBI document that we released today mentions different threats of white supremacists going out onto the police forces, as Mr. Meeink talked about being encouraged to do by neo-Nazi groups. 
They talked about the risk of sabotage, the risk of having access to elected officials, the risk of having access to weaponry and opportunities to use it. 
What do you think are the biggest risks of white supremacists actually infiltrating law enforcement? 
MEEINK: I believe the biggest risk is that the risk to communities policed by officers who are associated with white supremacist groups are engaged in other racist behavior. 
And I'm disappointed that the FBI has disavowed, apparently behind closed doors, it's 2006 assessment, particularly, because the 2015 assessment is much nearer in time and much more direct about what it's talking about, not just that officers might have white supremacist ideas but that they have active links to subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations. And the reason I'm concerned about that is because the FBI already deprioritizes the investigation of white supremacist violence. And this kind of disavowal disparages the work of very good and effective FBI agents who work these cases, despite the fact that they're not a priority. 
And there are a number of cases, the FBI in 2017, ran an operation that identified two corrections officers who were involved in a Ku Klux Klan plot to kill a black inmate. You know, these kinds of cases are critically important and there are many of them. I can go on. And we don't want to have the FBI creating a chilling effect within its own agency that would slow down the investigations like this, when we already have in civil rights color of law cases, declination rights upwards of 96 percent. 
And so, you can imagine how hard that is to continue working when you have that kind of attitude from your superiors. 
RASKIN: Thank you. Mr. Meeink let me come to you. I think it may have been Sergeant Taylor who voiced some skepticism about whether you can train somebody out of their racism and that that certainly seems right in the abstract. On the other hand, maybe your career, or your own evolution, is a counter example to that. We know Sheriff Napier spoke about the importance of racial, cultural sensitivity training. 
Do you think that's enough to make it work and how did you get out of the white supremacist ideology that you were so steeped in? You've got to unmute. 
MEEINK: Thank you and thank you for the question. Everything can help. Anything that gets more people involved with other human beings is something that will always help. 
That's what changed my life was having a consistent--God put people in my life to prove me wrong, consistently, to take the this right spiritual path. 
What I can tell you, what I know about how I changed my racism is that I learned that empathy plus humility equals humanity and I must be of service to people at all times. And that has changed my life, dramatically, for the better. The more important part about the policing is that we need to take this very serious and the fact that I'm talking about events that were 30 years ago. Do you know how many movements and groups have started and have done the same thing, since then. So, it's a real problem. It's really in there. We are finding more and more stories. Since my article came out in the Daily Beast, a couple weeks ago, more and more officers have been outed and will continue to do--we will continue to do that. 
The training is a great option. We need more people to really get involved with the communities that they once hated or are afraid of. A lot of the officers that we're getting our officers coming from the suburbs. They come into cities where suburban police forces that are getting a lot of men that are full of fear, fear that I used to fear. 
I looked in the face of that man with his knee on George Floyd's neck. He had arrogant fear written all over him. And that's what leads to racism. And that is racism. It's an arrogant fear. 
RASKIN: Thank you. My time is all up. Mr. Meeink, thank you very much. I now yield to the distinguished ranking member for his five minutes of questioning. You've got to unmute. 
ROY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate all the witnesses. Thank you for your testimony, particularly, those of you who served in law enforcement, not to belittle those who didn't but just appreciate your all service and appreciate you, Ms. Johnson, you said you have family members in law enforcement. So, appreciate you all being here. 
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to put into the record, an article the Wall Street Journal had, it's an editorial, to be clear called, ""Who Watches the Hate Watchers"" about the Southern Poverty Law Center's recent turmoil knowing the video that was put out here at the beginning of the hearing was a Southern Poverty Law Center video. 
RASKIN: Without objection. 
ROY: Yeah, the Journal points out some of the issues that the Southern Poverty Law Center has had within its own ranks and they've been kind of making some internal reviews about racism and sexism and other issues inside of the Poverty Law Center. 
Just putting that in the record as an indication that this is, we have a societal question. And so, I'm perfectly comfortable having these conversations to hear of law enforcement, as well, but that we should be looking across all these organizations, particularly, organizations who are focusing so heavily on it. 
A question for Sheriff Napier, could you describe, sir, the current difficulties you have in the hiring process and some of the processes you all go through, in respect to diversity and training in your hiring processes? 
NAPIER: Well, clearly, hiring is a significant challenge, right now. The current national rhetoric current law enforcement has not helped that, especially, trying to recruit, as we desperately do, people of color and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged background is exceptionally hard because, when you have this supposition there's systemic racism in the profession, it seems unwelcoming to people of color and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. 
So, it's an extreme challenge for all of us, right now, to hire but then also to retain. Once people get into this profession, it is now more difficult to retain them. My son is a Tucson police officer. And with some of the recent events, he said something that I hope will touch all of your hearts. He told me that, when he became a police officer, he said, ""Dad, I was willing to lay down my life for my community. I realized that that was part of what I had signed up to do."" He said, ""But dad, I never signed up to be hated like an animal."" 
And the execution and the ambush of law enforcement officers has a very disquieting and chilling effect on law enforcement officers and the ability to recruit these young people. 
So, this is an ongoing challenge and it's not getting better, anytime soon. There are certain economic drivers, of course, but the current rhetoric around law enforcement is not helping our recruiting efforts, especially, in those communities where we would really like to recruit better. 
ROY: Sure. Would you find it troubling, you're not the sheriff, you're in Travis County, Texas, where the city of Austin is--which I represent--the city of Austin just cut its department by a third, upwards of $150 million. 
They're now having to reroute and take folks from one--you know, for example, the drug unit they're having to move people off of that just for regular patrol. They're having now, sometimes, and they canceled, as I noted in my opening statement, they canceled the entire recruiting class, this existing class, which was the most diverse in history. 
Do you see that as a problem? Do you see that as something that might be a nationwide problem, beyond what I'm just seeing here, first-hand, in Austin, Texas? 
NAPIER: Of course. We're not asking law enforcement to do less. When I became a police officer in 1981, law enforcement was, arguably, pretty simple, by comparison to what it is in 2020. 
We're asking law enforcement officers to be mental health professionals, substance abuse counselors. We're asking more and more. So, the idea that you would remove funding at the very time when we're asking more of law enforcement than we ever have is non-sensible. Should we have a great community dialogue about the redefinition, a redefining of what law enforcement does and what services it provides the community and the manner in which those services are provided. 
That's a sensible dialogue. But I think that results in greater funding the law enforcement, not less. 
I just approached my board of supervisors to have additional appropriations for the hiring the community engagement specialists, which will be people that have specific mental health and substance abuse training that will respond to calls that normally, a deputy would respond to because they're a better tool. 
So, we' re actually going in the opposite direction. 
ROY: Yeah, Sherriff, I've got 30 seconds left and I'll be mindful of the clock. The chairman did. And I would just close with this question. You just touched on a very important issue that I would love us to have a long conversation about, the additive nature of having additional resources and mental health counselors and folks to support in supplement law enforcement versus a blunt whacking of law enforcement because of a reaction to--to issues that is an undermining law enforcement. Can you just speak to that, the additive nature versus subtractive nature and then I'll yield back Mr. Chairman? 
NAPIER: Yeah, I think the community is rightly concerned about what role law enforcement fills. And we--we are better able to fill that with more resources, not less. And the indiscriminate arbitrarily cutting of a third of a law enforcement agency is nonsensical and does very little to enhance public safety or to enhance the ability of law enforcement to respond to the evolving needs and desires of the community for public service. So, I would include that. Thank you. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Roy. Thank you--thank you, Sherriff. I now recognize the chair for her five minutes of questioning. Please unmute if you would Ms. Maloney. 
MALONEY: Hello. Can you hear me now? 
RASKIN: I can. 
MALONEY: Okay, thank you. Mr. German, I want to zero in on your August 2020 report. In that report you said that the FBI had previously identified the main problem of white supremacy in law enforcement as, quote, a risk to the integrity of the FBI investigations and the security of its agents and informants, end quote. What do you mean by that? 
GERMAN: Thank you for the question, Chairman Maloney. I believe that my concern is when you look at the 2006 assessment in the 2015 counterterrorism guide, the FBI identifies the primary problem of white supremacist, infiltration of law enforcement is the risk it poses to FBI investigations and law enforcement personnel rather than recognizing that the FBI also has a mandate to protect civil rights. 
And I believe that the primary problem with white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement is that the threat it poses to the communities, these officers, police. And, unfortunately, that's not even with the full redactions removed, that's not the primary concern reflected in those documents. 
MALONEY: Well, it seems that the FBI disagrees with you. They have refused to provide testimony for this hearing, and they have repeatedly told us that the 2006 threat assessment is an irrelevant and outdated document. 
So, in your report, you note that the FBI report does not address the potential harm what white supremacist police officers pose, quote, to communities of color. The police are to society at large. What is the impact on communities of color? Can you elaborate? Can police tolerate racism in their ranks? 
GERMAN: The criminal justice system, there are racial disparities at every step from who the police stop to who gets searched and who gets arrested to how they're charged to use of force issues. 
And we've seen these disparities persist over many decades now. And as long as there is a continuing persistence of white supremacist involvement and racist behavior in law enforcement, that is going to color the perception the public has about police, particularly, in the communities that are most heavily policed. And that disruption between the law enforcement and the communities they serve undermines the security of all of us. 
MALONEY: Also, and the 2006 assessment, the FBI stated, and I quote, white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement can result in other abuses of authority and passive tolerance of racism within communities served, end quote. 
Do you believe that observation has been borne out by current events that we have been observing the past few months? 
GERMAN: I--I do. And again, this isn't a new problem. And that there--there are FBI agents in field offices across the country who are doing good work on this topic. 
But because that work is deprioritized within the FBI, it becomes difficult for them to be as successful as they need to be. And, you know, I would particularly look at civil-rights color of law violations and the high rate of declination. 
MALONEY: Given--given all this, do you think that it's irresponsible of the FBI to continue to ignore this problem? 
GERMAN: Absolutely. If the problem is large enough for the FBI to warn its own agents, I think it's important that the FBI and the Department of Justice put a national strategy to protect the public from these officers, as well. And--and I totally agree that this is a small minority of police officers who are engaged in this behavior, but as long as it persists, it affects the whole system. 
MALONEY: Thank you. Mr. Meeink, earlier this month you gave an interview to the Daily Beast describing how multiple numbers of your gang have infiltrated the police department. What would you say to those who think that white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement is not a real threat? 
MEEINK: Thank you for the question. To answer that question--I know the facts. I know that there are people that I used to run with who are not very spiritually good people and are racist from the core. 
And I would fear, if I was a black person being pulled over on the side of the road, knowing the people I know that became cops, I would be fearful too. I yield my time. 
MALONEY: This is my last question. Given your experience, do you believe that there's a real problem of white supremacist infiltration of the police department? And then I yield back. 
MEEINK: Thank you. So, just to give you some experience real quick, I was a hockey coach for a long time. And I got out of the neo-Nazis. I had a great job of being a hockey coach. 
The reason why I bring that up is because every hockey team has an agitator, right. And he is a guy that goes out and starts trouble with the other team during a game. No matter what that man does, every person on that team has to stand up for him. 
So, when you have one racist Nazi cop in a precinct, the other cops might even not know his full beliefs, but just have to back him up at all times no matter what. And I think that's kind of the trouble that we're getting ourselves into is that people with the blue line will protect one another and not have to want to cause division between themselves even to call out somebody who is wrong. So, I worry about that that they will protect each other because the blue line like a hockey team. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Meeink. And the gentlelady yields back. Thank you, Madam Chair. I now recognize Mr. Clay for his five minutes of questioning. If Mr. Clay is not there, I'm going to go to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Looks like she may have had to step away. Let's see, I'm coming to Mr. Gomez. I see you are present. Mr. Gomez, you are recognized for five minutes. 
GOMEZ: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. One of the--Mr. Meeink, you have already given us your disturbing firsthand account of work by supremacist attempts to infiltrate law enforcement. 
The FBI 2006 assessment noted that white supremacist leaders and groups have historically shown an interest in infiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel. Can you tell us how this assessment squares with your own personal experience? 
MEEINK: Thank you for the question. Off of my personal experience, coming up in the neo-Nazi world, we weren't so much worried about the cops on the outside. We were more worried about FBI and other further investigation. 
So, we never had a full on hatred towards the cops. They were just kind of a speedbump. But we knew that in learning how to become police officers, we could affect our community better towards are views, and when I say better, and that is the disturbing fact and trend that I do see coming through the police department right now. 
GOMEZ: That counsel also noted in one of its redacted passages revealed today by the subcommittee that it was concerned about unreported instances, and infiltration that has gone undetected. 
It further noted that the possibility that infiltration has gone undetected is of great concern. As someone who has been in the room when organized white supremacist have had these conversations, do you think the FBI is being irresponsible when, today, it discounts a likelihood that infiltration goes undetected or unreported? 
MEEINK: So, I know that in the rooms, what we always have talked about, was how to try to get around their test to make sure that they don't see that we have, either neo-Nazi past or neo-Nazi beliefs. 
So, it is talked about regularly about how to try to get around their--it is actually becomes a goal of theirs is to get around the screening process of police departments. That is talked about in the rooms all the time. 
GOMEZ: When these groups of white supremacists, is there often more than one or two or how many would be in--in the particular police department? And would they operate more as a--as a thick within that department or that station? 
MEEINK: I've never been projecting on my end and I wouldn't know the facts to that. So, I would-- really, I know that there's neo-Nazis that get in the police. I don't know how many do it at the time. I don't know, you know, I can't give you any--I don't want to speak out of turn or say something I do not know is a fact. The other stuff I've talked about is fact. So, this I couldn't know the answer to. 
GOMEZ: The reason why I'm asking that question, in Los Angeles County, and this is a question for Mr. German. In Los Angeles County there--we have the Sheriff's Department has had a long history of having some--some people call it cliques, other people call it gangs that dominate station houses and often been terrorizing at black and brown communities. 
And I've actually been to the station. I've went on ride-alongs with actually the Sheriff's Department unincorporated East L.A., and it was something that I saw firsthand. One of the station, and unincorporated East L.A. was called Fort Apache, right. So--so, something that I actually witnessed myself. 
Well, just last month a lawsuit alleged that one of these gangs inducts new members after they had been involved in shooting or acts of brutality by giving them inking parties where they are tattooed with Nazi imagery. 
Chairman Raskin and I have asked the DOJ to investigate. Mr. German, How do these violent gangs or these cliques fit into your white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement? 
GERMAN: It certainly one manifestation of the problem. You did--again, it--when you see these instances, it's often through civil rights lawsuits or investitive journalist who are uncovering these cases. And then, law enforcement responds once it's a public scandal. 
Where, course, people in law enforcement understood this was an issue long before the investitive journalist or victims of these abuses come forward. And that's the problem with the FBI's reporting is that it acknowledges there's a problem, but it's solution is to--is to advise its agents to protect their cases rather than having a comprehensive national strategy to identify these officers that are often known within their departments and make sure that we are nipping this in the bud proactively as we would if it was any other kind of terrorist group. 
GOMEZ: Yeah, one last thing is that I want to just acknowledge that the Sheriff's Department in LA has different cliques or gangs, and some are white supremacist affiliated and some are multiethnic. 
And what happens is that if you don't join that clique, there's a lot of pressure, like as Mr. Meeink says, members who are joining, that are new to the law enforcement, the new deputies feel like they won't be protected if there back is on the line on the streets. 
So, they--they have this weird pressure to join. And in the end, law enforcement should be committed, not to an ideology, but to the department and its ability to protect and serve the people of the communities. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
RASKIN: Mr. Comer, you are now recognized for your five minutes. 
COMER: Well, thank you. My questions will be geared towards the Sheriff. Sherriff, appreciate you being here, appreciate all the witnesses being here. 
You mentioned the hiring process in your remarks. And I do think it's important that we have that kind of very heavy representation of minority police officers, minority law enforcement, especially, in the minority districts. I think that would go a long way towards solving a lot of the distrust that exist out there. What are the current challenges you face with respect to hiring the right people in a diversity in hiring? 
NAPIER: Well, I would say to some degree, this very hearing does not help that. When you allege that there is systemic infiltration of white supremacist and people with racial or biased ideology within the profession, it's not welcoming to people of color. And that's understandable. 
I don't see that. What we're doing, personally, on my department is going down to inner-city high schools and trying to welcome these people very early on in their sophomore and freshman year of high school, try to recruit down there to say you have a home with our family and to establish those relationships very early on. 
But this continual assertion that there is systemic infiltration of white supremacists and people with racial animus in this profession does not help that. And I don't speak about this, you know, from anecdotal evidence or from an academic perspective, but rather, as a practitioner for 39 years. 
COMER: Well, I couldn't agree more. And I was going to ask you how you felt like the current national dialogue among the Democrats, because it is among the Democrats, implying the systematic racism, their constant drum beating to defund the police in certain cities, cities which, by the way, need law enforcement more than--more than anyone. 
And even this committee, the title of this hearing, White Supremacy and the Blue, I mean, what's that doing to law enforcement right now, to the morale, to race relations, I mean, can you kind of give us an example of what it's like? 
NAPIER: Well, I think it's strained our relationship further with the communities that we struggle historically to bond with. It's been an ongoing struggle through the entirety of my career. 
I would take as such, I don't think this is purely a partisan issue, I think there are some Republicans that are concerned, myself being one of them, about having better relations with people of color, to better reach out and to better understand those communities. I think that's a responsibility that law enforcement needs to embrace without respect to partisan ideology. 
But these things are--are not helping our relationship with people of color in these disenfranchised communities that we have historically struggled with. 
COMER: I completely agree. I've supported many parts of criminal justice reform, especially, sentencing and things like that, sentencing injustices, I believe we need more minority law enforcement officers. I've always said that. 
But I do believe that the constant attacking of our law enforcement is heavily overweighted in the Democrat rhetoric right now right before an election for obvious reasons. But, Sheriff, you know, every profession has bad apples in law enforcement is no exception. What challenges do you face with respect to weeding out the bad apples once they become employed as law enforcement officers? 
NAPIER: Well, there are tremendous due process and union agreements that make it very difficult for us sometimes two weed out these bad apples. To--we have some people that have frightening disciplinary histories on our department and it's hard to get rid of these people and to get them out the door. 
So, it is an ongoing challenge. We do want law enforcement officers to have due process rights and to be protected like any citizen would expect to be protected in the employment environment. 
But to some extent, maybe these protections have gone a little too far and a little too constraining on executives like myself, who recognize a problem in think that this person might be better equipped to be in a different profession. 
COMER: Well, I completely agree. Let me thank you for your service. Thank all of our law enforcement women and men who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. And I have 14 seconds left here. 
I do believe that if we're looking for bipartisan opportunities, a bipartisan opportunity for us to work together, Madam Chairwoman, would be to eliminate the barriers that let law enforcement have, like the Sherriff just mentioned, and making it easier to get rid of the bad apples in law enforcement. It's very difficult to fire someone once they get tenure or once they get merit or they become a civil servant. And it shouldn't be that way when you're dealing with--with bad, a few bad cops. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Comer. I now recognize Mr. Clay for questioning for five minutes. 
CLAY: Mr. Chair, did you say Mr. Clay. 
RASKIN: Mr. Clay, yes, you are recognized for five minutes and then we've got you. 
CLAY: Thank you so much and Ranking Member Roy for conducting this hearing. And let me also congratulate Sergeant Taylor for your retirement in your service to the St. Louis community over the years. We appreciate that. 
The types of post and comments that the Plain View Project identified reflect anti-black racism, anti-Hispanic racism, Islam-phobia, homophobia, trans-phobia and violence against civilians. Sergeant Taylor, our city, St. Louis, was one of the cities exploited by the project. 
And as the head of the St. Louis ethical society of police, can you talk about how these races attitudes translate off-line? 
TAYLOR: Thank you for your question. And thank you. So, the attitudes, how they translate is that in the state of Missouri, you are 91 percent more likely to be stopped and pulled over if you are African American compared to white drivers. 
Also, how it translates is that African American officers in the St. Louis city are 60 percent more likely to leave SLMPD within their first seven years. We also know that African Americans in our community overwhelmingly apply to become police officers, even in this environment right now. 
African Americans want to be police officers and they apply. The catch is, is that the hiring process is sometimes not fair. So, you have all those systemic factors that are in play and they--they limit the opportunities of African-Americans in our city to become police officers. 
And you think about the Plain View Project and what it did is that it exposed these biases in these homophobia and racism. And what you see it in a bigger picture is systemic problems. 
CLAY: And you mentioned in your testimony $16 trillion as a result of systemic racism. Do you have any idea of how much St. Louis has paid out for police misconduct and wrongful death settlements? Do you have any idea about that? 
TAYLOR: Oh, millions, millions. We recently had an officer, a captain, who settled a lawsuit for one--over $1 million for racism indiscrimination. We have Detective Luther Hall who was brutally beaten by four white police officers. His partner, who is white, who was working with him undercover, wasn't touched. 
So, Luther was beaten but not his partner who is white. So, that's likely going to be a settlement. Milton Green who was shot by another white colleague, an officer coming to the aid of those officers. So, that--you know, it's in the millions. They increased--double the budget for lawsuits now. 
CLAY: Which burdens the taxpayers in a disproportionate way. Let me--let me ask you about a Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner's exclusion--exclusionary list where she does not take certain cases from officers who are on this list. I noticed that some of them match up with these post that are from this article. 
What does that do to the morale of police officers as--as German has said for the good officers? What does that do when they see these cases not being taken and the whole thing about not being disciplined for these racist posts that are put up? 
TAYLOR: It is very difficult. It's--it's in one sense you're happy, you're absolutely clapping that she is refusing to take their cases. But on the back end of it, we still have to work with these people. We have to work with people who are homophobic, who are racist, who are making these violent threats. 
And the belief, or my belief is that a good majority of us are coming to work to do our job and we do it fairly. However, we have to stand up. We have to stand up as officers, black and white, when we see these post by other officers and we see corruption, we have to stand up. And it is a memorial, as far as, you know, your spirits are down a lot of times within the police department when you see these things. 
CLAY: Again, thank you for your service. And Mr. Chairman, my time is expired. I yield back. 
RASKIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Clay. I now recognize Ms. Wasserman Schultz for her five minutes of questions. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The threat of white supremacy has become really more dangerous than ever. And meanwhile, the presence of white supremacist embedded within law enforcement makes it more difficult to detect and counteract threats from violent hate groups. 
In June 2016, for example, California police officers were found to be collaborating and protecting members of the Traditionalist Workers Party, a neo-Nazi group, in order to target, quote, ""Antiracist activist after a clash in Sacramento."" 
In February 2019, a police lieutenant in Portland was discovered to have a long-running friendly correspondence with the leader of Patriot Prayer, a far right extremist group. 
My own South Florida community has not been immune to hate within its own law enforcement ranks. In 2015, four Fort Lauderdale police officers were found to have exchanged violently racist text messages, leading to the dismissal of at least three dozen cases against black defendants. 
Now, I don't want to give the impression that this is representative of all law enforcement. But these examples alone are too many. And they undermine our nations promise of equal justice. So, Mr. German, my question is, can law enforcement's responses to white supremacist be blunted by sympathetic officers who don't perceive right wing terrorism as a threat? 
GERMAN: Absolutely they can be. And I think the solution is to, as Professor Johnson has advocated, (AUDIO GAP). 
As Sergeant Taylor has suggested, protecting the good officers who report their colleagues when they engage in racist behavior so that we can have a system that the good officers are able to report the misconduct of their colleagues without themselves being targeted and then the prosecutors can make sure that those officers testimony is not being used in a way that would undermine the rights of defendants who are charged with crime. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Sergeant--Sergeant Taylor, have you noticed a difference between how your colleagues assess threats exposed by violent white extremist opposed to those--as opposed to those of other groups like individuals, for example, protesting George Floyd's murder? 
TAYLOR: Yes, we've had colleagues that have been white and black that believe George Floyd was murdered. However, we do have employees that stated, you know, it was justified, that seeing the knee and George Floyd's neck was justifiable and that goes with my opening statement with that officer was one of them, but he's not the only one. 
What that does, it brings in that divide once again that we are on opposite ends a lot of times when it comes to things like that along racial lines. And it doesn't help bring us together to do our job effectively. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you. (AUDIO GAP) Okay, last month we saw a video of police in Kenosha providing water, for example, to right wing militia members and telling them that they, quote, ""Appreciated their presence"" even though they were heavily armed and out after a county curfew. 
Later that night, one of those militia members, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly opened fire and killed two protesters. Mr. German, in your experience going undercover with white supremacist groups, do you think that these extremists believe law enforcement, whether implicitly or explicitly is more aligned with their worldview? 
GERMAN: (AUDIO GAP) in my frustration is law enforcement officers don't seem to recognize the danger of their colleagues. (AUDIO GAP) Santa Cruz County Sheriff's deputies attacked by far right militants; we haven't seen a change in police behavior towards these militants. And I think that poses a threat, not just to the communities these police officers serve, but to law enforcement officers themselves. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: As I close, it's time that we--it's time that we acknowledge the dangers of a police culture that compromises its ability to address violent right wing extremist by tolerating it within its own ranks, even if by a small minority. And I was glad to hear Mr. Comer say that we need to go after bad apples. 
But by failing to fully tackle what internal law enforcement studies have flagged as a problem, in public confidence in our police is further eroded at a time when we can least afford it. So, I appreciate the opportunity to have this hearing today. And I yield back. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. I now recognize Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the Vice Chair Subcommittee for her five minutes of questioning. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Thank you so much Chairman Raskin and thank you to all of our panelist here and our witnesses here today for your testimony and offering your insight. 
Before I began, I would like to ask unanimous consent to submit to the record a Department of Justice hate--a report on hate crime victimization and a CNN article which summarizes the report. 
RASKIN: Without objection. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Now, far too much of the discussion around the issue of white supremacist infiltration in policing focuses on whether this problem existed all. And we have known for generations that it's not a question about whether this problem is an issue, it's a matter of--of how we have allowed it to sustain for so long. 
Congress, as well, has been complicit. And our silence has been allowed--has allowed for more violence and continued generational trauma in our communities. You know, the question was raised by the ranking member early--earlier, why do we keep talking about this? We keep talking about this because we have not solved this problem. 
And I want to make very clear that when we talk about systemic racism, we aren't litigating the individual attitudes of anyone officer. We can all exist in racist systems and do not have to be racist, or consciously racist, in order to participate in these systems. 
And I think it's quite evident when you look at the outcome of the war on drugs, a systemic racism is about the laws that are on the books. It is about the types of enforcement that happens. It's about how--how many officers get designated to some communities more than others that yields race--racial disparities in their outcomes. It doesn't have to do with litigating each and every one individual officer. 
And that is really the issue that is at play. One of the things that I wanted to discuss is we have to stop asking about if white supremacy in policing exists and I think we need to start figuring out how we can better determine the scale of this problem. How big is this issue? 
Mr. German, in your report you write about the unbroken chain of law enforcement involvement in violent organized racist activity right up to the present day. But you also note that only rarely do these cases lead to criminal charges. So, why is that? 
GERMAN: Thank you for the question. I believe it's difficult to prosecute police officers because--partly because of the way that the civil rights laws are written and have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. So, there is certainly room for Congress to work on that. 
But, also, for how the FBI investigates these crimes where when there is an incident of alleged police brutality that law--the FBI will often investigate that very narrowly, much the way they do hate crimes. Are we able to prove that there is some kind of bias or intention to violate civil rights in this case rather than looking comprehensively at that police officer's past to know whether that bias could be proven by other means? 
And then, those cases are sent to Justice Department prosecutors in the vast majority of them are declined for prosecution. So, it becomes a matter of road. The FBI agents know that they just churn these cases out for declination. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Thank you. And Sergeant Taylor, in your decades long career in law enforcement, how often would you see officers who harbored and acted on white supremacist views actually held responsible for their actions? 
TAYLOR: Very rarely, very rarely. We have an officer that--with COVID-19 who made a statement about Chinese Americans and COVID being spread in San Francisco. Reported him, had a citizen report him decades before he had been disciplined for 30 days for using the N-word. And he still on the street patrolling. So, very rarely. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ: So, we have testimony that this is a problem and it's not being--it's systemically not being addressed. But Professor Johnson, I have one last question. 
I think it's important that we talk about the legal mechanisms by which kind of that perpetuate this issue. So, let's talk about qualified immunity. How does the legal system in general including qualified immunity, protect racist law enforcement officers from accountability and how can we hope to evaluate the true spread of this problem given those barriers? 
JOHNSON: That's an excellent question. I think qualified immunity is certainly a barrier to holding police officers civilly liable. And then, we also have the fact that interest align between police and prosecutors because prosecutors depend so much on police officers to help make their cases. 
So, you see a situation where, you know, officers are not being held responsible within their own ranks. They are not being held responsible by prosecutors and they are not being held responsible through our civil courts. And so, it's just a sickening problem. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Professor Johnson, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. I now recognize Ms. Pressley for her five minutes of questioning. 
PRESSLEY: Thank you, Chairman Raskin, for convening this hearing. I think it is worth repeating history. And the roots of policing are inextricably linked to the antebellum slave patrols of the South that led to the establishment of all-white police departments. 
And since the Fugitive Slave Act, criminal law enforcement has met the subjugation and dehumanization of black lives. After the Civil War, police departments and local governments throughout the country were saturated with Ku Klux Klan members and sympathizers who refuse to intervene in their campaign of terror. 
And by the early 20th century, the KKK had over 1 million members. Mr. Meeink, given your experience with white supremacist groups, do you think that contemporary organizations have tried to continue this campaign of influence on law enforcement? 
MEEINK: Thank you for the question. Yes ma'am, I believe that, you know, that a lot of the old neo-Nazi groups have now become more groups like the Proud Boys and a lot of those Proud Boys are filling and wanting to be police officers. 
They are now flying the cop's flag at all their rallies and in their homes. I mean, they're--so, the Proud Boys who used to be what I would consider--are the neo-Nazis of the early '90s and '80s, are planning to gear up to become law enforcement. That's they're now a new goal because they see the damage they can do and get away with it. 
That's why they want to join. They know that they can--the war on drugs, as AMC has said, the war on drugs and the treading on our fourth amendment allows bully cops to pull us from cars, to bring dogs around us, to search us when we have not committed a crime and we are the citizens and our civil circuit should not be able to do that. I will yield my time. 
PRESSLEY: Thank you. And it's clear from the historical record that we cannot simply rely on training to address this problem. Across our country, racism is often ingrained in official and unofficial police trainings. 
So, take the case of Travis Yates. After the Minneapolis mayor band so-called warrior training for the city's cops to reduce police violence, Yates offered to train Minneapolis police for free. 
And this summer, in the wake of George Floyd's murder, (AUDIO GAP) the court is saying that Tulsa police shoot African Americans, quote, ""Less than we probably ought to,"" end quote. 
Then there is John Guandolo, and ex-FBI agent whom the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as, quote, notorious Muslim basher and conspiracy theorist, end quote. 
He has provided law enforcement trainings in at least seven states since leaving the FBI in 2008. So, Sergeant Taylor, have you heard of or had any experiences with these kinds of racist violent trainings? 
TAYLOR: They do exist. And the example that I used in my opening statement that officer is a defense of tactics training officer, and he trains another jurisdiction. And after, you know, we complained on him, thank goodness, they no longer use him to train other officers. 
So, yes, you know, he is steeped in violent ideologies, racism toward African Americans, Muslims, you name it and he trains other officers. So, that is present, it is very much present in law enforcement with these officers and they are allowed to fester and fester and fester. And the policies allow that. 
PRESSLEY: And might I also just, you know, add to here for a moment, I appreciate the enthusiastic affirmation and support and the need to end qualified immunity. I have introduced a bill with Justin Amash to do that to address the callous impunity and disregard for black and brown lives. I mean, there can be no justice without accountability and there's no accountability for as long as we have that doctrine. 
Mr. German, have you seen other instances where police training has emerged as a pressure point for spreading white supremacy's? 
GERMAN: I--I identify, you know, even in implicit biased training, which we expect to be the most comprehensive in antiracism. I quote three separate trainers who say they specifically avoid mentioning explicit racism in law enforcement because they don't want to offend their audience. 
And that, I think, is a bigger part of the problem is that by willingly turning a blind eye to this problem, we allow it to fester rather than taking it head on and making sure we understand that we can't stop or correct implicit bias and unconscious bias if we don't address over an explicit bias. 
PRESSLEY: And Professor Johnson, given the sequence of events that took place in Kenosha Wisconsin where Kyle Rittenhouse murdered and injured black lives matter activist, can you give us your view, because I think history is so important, on the evolution of American law enforcement as a protector and ally of white supremacist groups? 
JOHNSON: You--I mean, your question illustrates how significant this history is. I mean, between the first police departments being organize to catching slaved people to the lynching's that took place for decades without any white people being held responsible by law enforcement to, you know, a lot of unrest that we saw in Los Angeles in the '90s and elsewhere, that this is something that is consolidated power within the state and it's used against people of color and poor people in this country. 
RASKIN: Thank you. The gentle lady's time is expired. 
PRESSLEY: Thank you. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Ms. Pressley. And thank you Professor Johnson. I turned out to the representative from the District of Columbia, Ms. Norton you're recognized now for your five minutes. 
NORTON: Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman? 
RASKIN: Yes, we've got you. 
NORTON: Thank you. This is a very important hearing that we are, and not the first one we've had on this subject. I am concerned that despite identifying this problem, going back to 2006, we are in 2020 now, the FBI has done nothing to address what has become a growing threat. 
And now, they appear to be arguing that it doesn't exist at all. I know that the two FBI witnesses did come before us last year. They gave us in 2000, more than 2000 words of testimony. They didn't even use the words white supremacy once. And that's after the Charlottesville killing of Heather Heyer. 
Even more concerning for me is that there's been a recent whistleblower report that alleges that senior Trump Administration appointees have attempted to suppress the segment of a DHS threat assessment that predicted an elevated threat environment from white supremacist groups this year. 
That is what I mean about a growing threat that is still being denied by the FBI. Mr. Chairman, I would like to flip to the other side of this issue because I am concerned that in recent years the FBI has released a report on what apparently all experts agree is a fictitious movement, they call black identity extremism. 
I have found no expert that says there's any such thing. So, I would like to ask Mr. German, do you know of any such movement, black identity extremism? And what does it mean to you that the FBI would rather focus on what experts seem to agree is an imagined threat of black identity extremist but not on the threat of white supremacists and police? 
GERMAN: I think it's an example of the systemic bias that exist in law enforcement. The FBI remains an overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male organization. 
So, when their guidelines are altered to allow them to investigate the use without evidence of criminality, evidence of wrongdoing, that can target people that are afraid of, because of bias, rather than focusing on evidence that shows the individual or group is engaged in finding (AUDIO GAP). 
NORTON: Thank you. Professor Johnson, can you talk about barriers inside of federal law enforcement that make it difficult to give the issue of white supremacy and the attention it requires now? 
JOHNSON: Well, I think we just--that our law enforcement lacks the political will to address it. There is an ABC pull in 2017 found that 10 percent of Americans found that was acceptable the whole white supremacist or neo-Nazi views. 
And so, you have to imagine that there may be a similar number of law enforcement officers that feel that way. And so, (AUDIO GAP) inside of law enforcement and no real pressure from outside to address this issue. It's going to continue to fester. 
NORTON: Thank you. Finally, I would like to ask Sergeant Taylor, as a local law enforcement officer, so, what are you looking for from the federal government? That's what we have to focus on here as members of Congress. What are you looking for from the federal government to help you combat this threat? What can we do? 
TAYLOR: Well, I think that (AUDIO GAP) and I'm speaking to the very people that are in the field that have experienced these atrocities that are black, white, you know, homophobia, racism, all these different extreme views that officers have. We have to have those people at the table to discuss these things. 
And if you don't have them there with these views that have experienced these things and fault these systems, and that goes for our community, as well, if we don't have them present, everything can't be white and male. You have to have diversity there to bring these views into play to actually address them. It has to come from a well-rounded perspective. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Ms. Norton, for your questioning. And finally, we come to Ms. Tlaib, for her five minutes of questioning. 
TLAIB: Thank you so much, Chairman Raskin for allowing this courageous hearing to happen. I--I do want to take a moment and recognize Sergeant Taylor's incredible courage, as well. I know it hasn't been easy for you to speak the truth about what was going on while you were serving there. I'm sure it's continuing even after your retirement. So, we really do appreciate, especially, in my community, that is 85 percent black, I so appreciate you speaking up. 
The issue we're discussing is not speculation. And I'm really, you know, worried that we continue to say that it's some sort of theory out there. It's been proven that it's our reality today. And white supremacy, as you all know, has not been confined to Facebook post. It's just evidence that what is actually bleeding into our communities and that is making us all unsafe right now. 
Recent horrific events have occurred in my district that have raised concerns for me. And so, Professor Johnson, I want to start with you. Yes or no, should we be concerned that some white right-wing white extremist groups see police departments as allies? 
JOHNSON: Yes, absolutely. 
TLAIB: So, this is something that I actually have seen firsthand in my district. Last year, the Detroit Police Department escorted a heavily armed neo-Nazi group waving Nazi flags and wearing swastika armbands as they disrupted a pride festival. 
In the aftermath, the Detroit police chief defended the protection of his department that he gave to armed white supremacists saying with regard to antiracist counter protest that, quote, both sides were wrong, which drew outrage, of course, in our community. 
However, the treatment of Black Lives Matter peaceful protestors by Detroit police recently, they were met with beatings, chokehold's, teargas and arrest. They had to go as far, these protesters had to go as far as to get a federal judge, which agreed that they have to stop using batons, chemical agents like teargas and chokehold on protesters. 
So, Professor Johnson, how does this kind of protection for neo-Nazis versus the violence towards those protesting right now for black lives in Detroit, a city, again, that is 85 percent black, make us safer? 
JOHNSON: And I think its evidence of exactly what this subcommittee is investigating. 
TLAIB: Thank you so much. You know, one of the things that is of concern to me as, you know, the FBI does not believe this topic was worthy of testimony today, even though their own report and assessments state that white supremacist have infiltrated police departments and could lead to tolerance of racism against black communities. 
And so, when I hear your testimony, Sergeant Napier, or Captain, or is it Sergeant, I believe, Napier, are you there. 
NAPIER: I am ma'am. It's Sherriff. 
TLAIB: Yeah, Sherriff, I'm sorry. One of the things that concerns me, you know, you talk about your son. And I'm, you know, of course, concerned about a lot of things when it comes to policing in my community. But I want to take a close look at something that happened within your district. 
Last November, one of your officers was caught on camera tackling a black teen in foster care who lives without arms or legs, Sheriff, okay. He was tackled by an officer under your leadership. He was also seen abusing another black teen who was merely filming the incident. 
That officer was not charged. So, I'm wondering if that is the case of why you haven't been able to diversify your work--your--your team or, you know, some of the concerns. And so, I truly believe, you know, curious on your end, what kind of treatment did that officer get? Was he held accountable? 
NAPIER: Well, first, we presented that as we should. We put the officer on immediate leave and presented that matter to the county attorney's office who made the decision to decline criminal charges. That was not-- 
TLAIB: So, he was never charged, correct? 
NAPIER: That was a basis on-- 
TLAIB: --Do you think that is also leading to people not wanting to work for a police force that is, you know, constantly involved in criminal activity and assault of innocent civilians? 
NAPIER: Well, it was deemed not to be criminal activity, ma'am-- 
TLAIB: --I understand-- 
NAPIER: --because the attorneys office made that decision. I did not make that decision. It's not my decision. 
TLAIB: Oh, I know. Sherriff, the system is broken, and I know you don't want to face the fact that you and your son are in a system right now that is broken. And I know that you're--you're detouring away from talking about it in that way. 
But, you know, going back to Sergeant Taylor, one of the things that I know the Black Lives Matter protesters in my district have been crying out is please invest more into our schools. Invest more into our communities and neighborhoods. 
One of the things I hear from my police officers is they weren't trained to be nurses or social workers or mental health care workers. They want to see more investment in that because that keeps them safe and that keeps the community they are supposed to be keeping safe, of course, safer. 
Can you talk a little bit about that Sergeant Taylor because I feel like a mesh of what many of these protesters are out there demanding was to just shift in recognizing their lives matter in recognizing that they have to have investment in their quality of life, which again, makes the job of law enforcement obviously much more at ease versus right now where they are criminalizing communities of color? 
TAYLOR: So, thank you for that question. I think that most law enforcement officers would prefer having social workers in our--and our jobs because we don't want to respond to a lot of these calls because we are ill-prepared for it. I studied psychology and I'm still ill-prepared for it even with empathy. And these ideologies about law enforcement are accurate in the sense that we--we have a problem with addressing--addressing our internal problems, first off. 
And then, we have a problem with how we respond to these calls because we want to put force in places that force is not necessary. This is what we're taught. We're taught to be these warriors where we should be guardians. 
And then, even with being a Guardian, we are ill-prepared for that. So, when people talk about defunding the police, when they talk about reallocating these resources, it's necessary because we need more conflict resolution. We have a lack of that. We have a lack of that in law enforcement. We have a lack of de-escalation. 
And so, when you bring in people that have these four-year degrees, which most of us do not have, you bring those people and who have these specialties in these skills, it can offset us responding and shooting a 13-year-old in the back who has autism. So, it's important that we have these people in these jobs. And most of the time, most law enforcement officers will agree that they don't necessarily want to respond on these calls anyway because we are ill-prepared for it. 
TLAIB: That's exactly what I'm hearing. Thank you so much. And again, Chairman, I--I will pray for Sergeant Taylor. I know how extremely difficult it is for her to come up and speak the truth about this, and, you know, really so much respect for you today. Thank you so much. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Councilman Tlaib. Thank you, Sergeant Taylor. In closing, I want to thank, not just Sergeant Taylor, but all of our panelist today for their extraordinary participation, Michael German, Sergeant Taylor, Professor Vida Johnson, Frank Meeink, Sherriff Mark Napier from Arizona, thank you all for coming and participating so intelligently in this important conversation. 
The question of the neutrality in the fairness of law enforcement all across America goes right to the question of our social contracts. You know, if you read any of the social contracts, theorist John Locke or Thomas Hobbes or Rousseau, all of them said that we enter into society because we'll be safer inside the social contract then outside of it, which Hobbes said, you know, was a state of nature, a state of war and violence, nasty brutish, and short. 
And so, we enter the social contract, but we expect that the police who we pay to protect us will act with the neutrality and fairness and respect for everyone in the community. And we know that the vast majority of officers enter with that idea. So, the infiltration of white supremacists' members, activists, ideas and attitudes is a threat to public security and public safety and it's a threat to the reputation of the law enforcement function, which I think all of us agree. 
It is, whether you consider it a few bad apples are a lot of bad apples, but those bad apples can spoil the reputation of the whole bureau. So, we hope that the FBI will stand up and take credit for the things that it is saying and doing to identify the problem and come up with a national strategy for making sure that we don't have that kind of infiltration and suffusion of white supremacist attitudes and ideas and actions in law enforcement. 
With that, without objection, all members will have five legislative days within which to submit additional written questions for the witnesses to the chair and we will forward them to the witnesses for their prompt response. I ask all of our witnesses to please get it back as soon as you can. 
And with that, I thank you all for your participation. The hearing is now adjourned "

[*]DOYLE: So the committee will now come to order. Today the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology and the Subcommittee on Consumer Protections and Commerce are holding a joint hearing entitled A Country in Crisis How Disinformation is Dividing the Nation. 
Due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, today's hearing is being held remotely. All members and witnesses will be participating via video conferencing. As a part of our hearing, microphones will be set on mute for the purpose of eliminating inadvertent background noise. Members and witnesses you will need to unmute your microphone each time you wish to speak. Documents for the record can be sent to Chloe Rodriguez at the email address we provided to staff. All documents will be entered into the record at the conclusion of the hearing. The Chair will now recognize himself for a five-minute opening statement. 
Good morning and welcome to today's joint hearing on disinformation and the crisis it is creating in our country and for our democracy. I want to thank our panel of witnesses for joining us virtually today. While the committee has held several virtual hearings so far, this is the first one I have chaired so please bear with me as we get through this. 
The matter before the committee today is one of pressing importance. The flood of disinformation online principally distributed by social media companies and the dangerous and divisive impact it is having on our nation as we endure the COVID-19 epidemic. Over 120,000 Americans have already lost their lives to this virus, and nearly 2.4 million Americans have been infected. Tens of millions of people are out of work as we attempt to stop the spread of this virus and prevent an even greater disaster. 
In the midst of this historic crisis, we are also facing an historic opportunity. Tens of millions of Americans are calling for racial justice and systematic changes to end racism and police brutality in the wake of the horrific murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other black Americans at the hands of law enforcement. Black Lives Matter movement has resulted in protests around the globe and online as people are taking to the streets, to social media to express their support for change, and as we march for progress and grapple with this deadly disease, the divisions in our country are growing. 
While our nation has long been divided today, we see that much of this division is driven by misinformation, distributed, and amplified by social media companies, the largest among them being Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. These platforms have become central to the daily lives of so many around the globe, and to the way people get their news, interact with each other, and engage in political discourse. Our nation and the world are facing a heretofore unprecedented tsunami of disinformation that threatens to devastate our country and the world. 
It has been driven by hostile foreign powers seeking to weaken our democracy and divide our people, by those in our country who seek to divide us for their own political gain and by social media company themselves who have put profits before people as platforms have become awash in disinformation and their business models have come to depend on these engaging and enraging nature of these false truths. 
When Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996, this provision provided online companies with a sword and a shield to address concerns about content moderation and a website's liability for hosting third-party content. And while a number of websites have used 230 for years to remove sexually explicit and overtly violent content, they have failed to act to curtail the spread of disinformation. 
Instead they have built systems to spread it at scale and to monetize the way it confirms our implicit biases. Everyone likes to hear and read things that confirm what they think is true, and these companies have made trillions of dollars by feeding people what they want to hear. As a result, these platforms have peddled lies about COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, voting by mail, and much, much more. When companies have done the right thing and stepped up to take down disinformation, they have been attacked by those who have benefited from it. 
Recently Twitter labeled a number of tweets by President Trump as inaccurate, abusive, and glorifying violence. In response, President Trump issued an executive order threatening all social media companies. The Department of Justice have issued similarly thuggish proposals as well. The intent of these actions is clear, to bully social media companies into inaction. 
Social media companies need to step up to protect our civil rights, our human rights, and our human lives, not to sit on the sideline as the nation drowns in a sea of disinformation. Make no mistake, the future of our democracy is at stake, and the status quo is unacceptable. While Section 230 has long provided online companies the flexibility and the liability protections they need to innovate and to connect people from around the world, it has become clear that reform is necessary if we want to stem the tide of disinformation rolling over our country. 
That concludes my opening statement, and it now gives me great pleasure to recognize my good friend Mr. Latta, ranking member for the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology for five minutes for his opening statement. 
LATTA: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very much for holding today's hearing on disinformation online, and I also want to thank our witnesses for joining us today. We are living in a time when Americans increasingly rely on the internet in their daily lives, and while our nation is battling the coronavirus having access to accurate information can mean the difference between life and death. 
As we all know, not everything we see and read online can be taken as fact due to inaccuracies or outright lies. I have some folks that have told me that everything on the internet is true because you can't put anything on the internet that wouldn't be true. So that is (INAUDIBLE) some people (INAUDIBLE). To date, companies have worked to police their platforms to remove harmful or inaccurate information online. 
In fact, Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to allow internet companies to do just that. The law was intended to encourage internet platforms then interactive computer services like CompuServe and America Online to proactively take down offensive content without having the fear of being held liable for doing the right thing. Hateful and racist comments should have no place in our society or on our platforms, and Section 230 provides a tool for companies to make sure this doesn't happen. And while some companies use this shield for its intended purpose, it is concerning that we are seeing other abuse of Section 230 after being pressured by activist employees or advertisers to make good Samaritan policies intended to fit their own political agenda. 
Many tech companies have benefited and grown because they are afforded CVA 230 protections. These protections have allowed them to become the true gatekeepers to the internet. But too often, we see that they don't want to take responsibility for the content within those gates. Let me be clear I'm not advocating that Congress repealed the law, nor am I advocating for Congress to consider niche carveouts that could lead to a patchwork of affability of the law. Section 230 was enacted for a reason. It is unfortunate however that the courts took such a broad interpretation of Section 230 simply granting fraud and liability protection without platforms having to demonstrate that they are doing, and I quote everything possible. 
Numerous platforms have hidden behind Section 230 to avoid litigation without having to take responsibility. Not only are good Samaritans sometimes being selective in taking down harmful or illegal activity, but Section 230 has been interpreted so broadly that bad Samaritans--bad Samaritans can skate by without accountability. 
Freedom of speech is a fundamental right upon which our democracy is built, and we must make sure these companies are now policing the free flow of speech, especially when it comes to political discussions as they continue to operate online platforms. While we are talking about private companies, many of the concerns I have outlined here today could simply be addressed if these companies be--began to equitably and consistently enforce their terms of service. If companies have the time and resources to make the difficult and complex decisions over moderating conservative speech, then surely they can make the easy decisions when it comes to taking down illegal, hate, or racist content on their platforms. 
I hope reports of political bias among large internet platforms are not an indication of their prioritization of resources. If so, then we should consider congressional scrutiny over how Section 230 is being used in the marketplace. So I will say it again I do not believe repealing Section 230 is the answer, but I do believe these companies could need more oversight as to how they are making certain decisions related to their content moderation practices, what they choose to censor and what they don't. 
We should make every effort to ensure that companies are using the sword provided by Section 230 to take down offensive and rude content but that they keep their power in check when it comes to censoring political speech. Again terms and services should be enforced equitably and consistently. I look forward to--to hearing from our today's witnesses and Mr. Chairman I yield back. 
DOYLE: Okay. I thank the gentleman. The chair now recognizes Ms. Schakowsky, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce for five minutes for her opening statement. Jan, you need to unmute if you haven't. 
SCHAKOWSKY: Okay, do that all of the time. Sorry. Thank you, Chairman Doyle. I am so glad to be doing a joint hearing with you, and I want to thank our distinguished panel for joining us today. 
Last fall Chairman Doyle and I held a joint hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Subsequent and subsequent--subsequently, my subcommittee held a hearing on unsafe products and fake reviews found online. At both hearings, industry representatives came and--and testified, big tech was here, and we heard that content moderation and consumer protection were really hard, and the industry could always do better, and they made promises but they discouraged congressional action. I think they may have even apologized as big tech typically does when it appears before this--this committee. 
Fast forward to 6 months--to 6 months later and add a global health pandemic and nationwide protests against policies of brutal and racial inequities and as we will hear today it is an under--understated--it is an understatement to say that industry could still be doing better. 
The harms associated with misinformation and disinformation continue to fall disproportionately on communities of color who already suffer worse outcomes from COVID-19 as--and at the same time, the president himself is con--cont--continually spreading dangerous disinformation that big tech is all too eager to promote. 
No matter what the absolutists say about Section 230, it is not only about free speech and content moderation; if it were, our conversation today would be very different. Instead big tech uses it as a shield to protect itself from liability when it fails to protect consumers from harm and from harmful public health and or harms public health and use it as a sword to intimidate cities and states when they consider legislation as Airbnb did in 2016 when New York City was considering regulating its online rent market for private homes. 
The truth is Section 230 protects business models and the generation--and generates pro--prolific scams, fake news, fake reviews, and unsafe counter--counterfeit and stolen products. This--this was never the intent, and since both courts and the industry refused to change it, Congress must do it, but we must do it in a responsible way. The President's recent actions are designed to kneecap platforms that face--that fact check him and engage in--checking the time here--that engage in what he claims is bias against conservative views. 
Let me be clear, the president is using his position to chill speech, and that is just wrong. We must encourage count--content moderation that fosters a safer and healthier online world and don't be--don't be fooled by made-up claims of bias against conservatives. Today it seems there is less of a bias against conservatives and rather a bias for conservatives. 
On June 19, nine of the ten top-performing political pages on Facebook were conservative pages, including Donald Trump, Donald Trump for President, Ben Shapiro, Breitbart, and Sean Hannity. And as the New York Times reported over the weekend Facebook in part--in particular seems to enjoy a cozy relationship with the Trump administration aided by Facebook's loyal Trump supporters Joe Kaplan(SP) and Peter Thiel(SP). I hope that Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Thiel will soon make it before Congress, make themselves available so that we can ask questions about the role that they--that they play and I am just so anxious to hear about--hear from our witnesses and I will you back at this time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
DOYLE: Thank you. The gentlelady yields back her time. The chair now recognizes--Ms. Rodgers has yielded her time I believe to Mr. Guthrie, so Mr. Guthrie, you are recognized for five minutes. 
GUTHRIE: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the chairs and the ranking members for holding this hearing and our distinguished panelist for being here. 
The coronavirus outbreak has shown us the true strength of American technology. As much of our world became digital, we saw innovation across the board from doctors switching to telehealth services to educators teaching students from afar, to friends and family connecting online more so than ever before. Through this explosion of innovation, we have seen the best in people, companies, and individuals stepping up to attempt to our new world and neighbors helping neighbors as we all go through this together. 
Sadly, it has also brought out the worst in some people. While social media and other online websites can be used to connect us with each other and to information unfortunately, bad actors can also weaponize these platforms to further spread disinformation, putting Americans' health and security at risk. 
Social media platforms have responded to disinformation campaigns differently. Some have taken a more active approach to monitoring and removing such content, while others have allowed disinformation, misinformation, and offensive and intolerable comments to fester on their sites unchecked. In either case, I think we can all agree that better transparency regarding how these internal guidelines are determined as well as the mechanisms by which such content is removed in the appeals processes they have in place, is needed. We must also ensure that social media companies are applying these standards fairly and not just laboring--labeling a differing opinion as disinformation. 
During this public health crisis, the Federal Trade Commission has continued its work protecting consumers, providing guidance to businesses, and protecting competition in the marketplace throughout the pandemic. They have issued dozens of warnings to individuals and entities marketing therapies and products that claim to prevent or treat COVID-19. Further, they have disseminated information with consumers on how to avoid such scams and verify information they come across--they come across online, which I've shared with my constituents. Disinformation will continue to be vital as we navigate this unprecedented time. 
Looking forward I believe that emerging technology has--has the potential to be useful in combating illicit content online and putting a stop to these bad actors that is why I recently introduced the Countering Online Harms Act which would direct the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a study on how artificial intelligence may be used to identify and remove harmful online content such as disinformation campaigns, deep fakes, counterfeit products and other deceptive and fraudulent con--content that is intended to scam or do harm. Further, my bill would require the FTC to submit a subsequent report to Congress with recommendations on how to implement solutions with AI to address those issues and recommendations for potential legislation. 
Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, we have tapped into America's innovative potential to solve many of our new problems, and I hope that the Countering(SP) Online Harms Act will build on this innovation to help protect American consumers as more and more of our lives are conducted online. Thank you to all of the witnesses for your participation today. I look forward to hearing your testimony, and Mr. Chairman I would like to submit for the record Ranking Member McMorris-Rodgers' opening statement, and thank you again and I yield back. I yield back. 
DOYLE: The gentleman yields back. The chair now--Mr. Pallone has yielded in his time equally between Mr. Butterfield and Ms. Blunt Rochester, so Mr. Butterfield, you can start for the first two and a half minutes and then yield to Ms. Rochester. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for convening this hearing today on the role that social media and other online platforms have in spreading disinformation. 
Mr. Chairman, the ability for virtually anyone to post thoughts and pictures and videos to social media has shed light on many of the systemic injustices and disparities that exist both in our country and around the world. However, we have also witnessed those same platforms used by domestic and foreign actors to undermine our democracy through disinformation campaigns making for the easy spread of false narratives that undermine the public's trust in institutions like the press and our governments. 
A disturbing pattern Mr. Chairman has emerged online, revealing that African-Americans and other racial minorities are consistently targeted by those seeking to promote disinformation. It is now well established that in 2016 foreign actors targeted the African-American community by way of social media in efforts to keep African-Americans from voting in the presidential election. That is a fact. 
More recently, mass protests following the death of George Floyd have often been wrongfully categorized on social media as violent by those seeking to undermine their purpose. Further, in the midst of a pandemic that disproportionately impacts communities of color, falsehoods have been spread from all--from our own President about the virus's treatment and testing and origins deepening already existing divides and putting the public's health at considerable risk. 
Such attempts at disenfranchisement and deception have no place, no place in a country where so many have fought bitterly and at such great cost to ensure that every American voice is heard at the ballot box and in the public square which has increasingly moved online. In order to achieve meaningful progress in the fight against disinformation online, it will take the full cooperation of policymakers, industry stakeholders and regulators to achieve our goal of an equitable online landscape that fosters health discourse, healthy discourse without also promoting and protecting the civil rights of all users. That is what Ms. Schakowsky was talking about a few minutes ago, and I want to completely associate myself with her words. 
At this time, Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned in the outset, I will yield the balance of my time for my friend from the state of Delaware Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you, Mr. Butterfield, for yielding. Last October, the Energy and Commerce Committee considered whether social media companies have done enough to control hate speech, voter suppression activities, and blatantly false information on their platforms. Less than a year later, we are faced with a pandemic, record-level unemployment, and Americans across the country demanding real action now on police violence and racial inequality yet social media companies have failed to prevent white nationalists, scammers, and other opportunists from using their platforms to exacerbate these crises. Notably, the largest platform, Facebook, stands out as the most irresponsible platform. 
2020 is a defining year for our democracy. Facebook and the other platforms have a responsibility to the country to get their act together and to be a part of the solution and not the problem. Thank you, and I yield back. Mr. Chairman? 
UNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman you--you are muted, we can't hear you. 
DOYLE: I'm sorry. At this time, the chair will recognize Ms. Brooks, who is being yielded Mr. Walden's time. Ms. Brooks, you are recognized for five minutes. 
BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Walden is at Rules Committee, so I have been asked to read his statement. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I welcome and thank all of our witnesses for joining us today to discuss online misinformation. The internet is both a tool for good and evil. It allows Americans to work and learn from home, gives us unlimited access to information, helps connect us to our loved ones, and strengthens our economy. 
The United States is a global leader in innovation and home to the most advanced technology companies in the world. The internet has also empowered bad actors to promote online scams, post harmful and offensive content, and globally disseminate this information for free. Often social media posts have become a cancer on civility, literally destroying reputations and lives with one click. 
It is revolting to see what some people post online. Something I can tell you from personal experience in this public position. But we all know it's hard to regulate speech, especially in a democracy and with the protections we are afforded under the First Amendment. We also know there are boundaries and limits, but over the course of our history, we have never had so much power to regulate speech concentrated in so few in the private sector and with the broad immunity protection they have under Section 230. 
As we battle COVID-19, access to factual information is more important now than ever however, we still see misinformation spread on platforms. I know the Trump administration has aggressively gone after bad actors, but as soon as you take down one site or profile another one pops up. It is a global battle. We are in the midst of a national fight for equality and justice. At the same time, we see bigots post unacceptable, racist, and offensive comments online. These comments have no place in our society. 
Congress expects internet companies to monitor their platforms and take down false, misleading, and harmful content. That is why Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides liability protection to companies that take down content on their platforms. Last fall, this committee held a hearing to re-examine Section 230. I said then and will say again, many concerns can be addressed if these companies simply do what they say they will do, enforce their terms of service. 
However, recent actions taken by these companies trouble me. Twitter recently enacted new policies that seemingly target President Trump. Meanwhile, tweets that actually advocate violence are not flagged. Questions remain about who makes these decisions. Google took action against the Federalist for allegedly violating Google's ad policy and comment sections not for the content of its articles, as NBC initially claimed. Significant questions persist as to whether Google followed their procedures and notified the Federalist directly. Moreover, why was this publication targeted and not others? 
I think I can speak for everyone on this committee when I say we do not support harmful or racist rhetoric or disinformation online. We expect these companies to do their best to flag or remove all offensive and misleading content, but we also expect these immensely powerful platforms to follow their own processes for notifying users when they have potentially violated those policies and to enforce policies equitably, but that does not appear to have happened of late. 
That is why I prepared legislation that will mandate more transparency from online platforms about their content practices. This would require these companies to file reports with the FTC so it is clear whether they are complying with their own terms of service and bring transparency to their appeal process. I hope this can be bipartisan legislation. This is a straightforward bill that only impacts companies with revenues over $1 billion, so I hardly think it will crash the internet. 
I realize given a mix of human review and artificial intelligence, these platforms are not always going to get it right, but they absolutely must be more transparent. The power to regulate speech in America is cloaked more and more in secret algorithms and centralized in the hands of a powerful few in the private sector. 
We have never needed transparency and accountability more. Freedom-loving Americans have far too much at stake for us to let internet companies go unchecked. Thank you, and I yield back. 
DOYLE: The gentlelady yields back. I want to thank her. I now want to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing. Ms. Brandi Collins-Dexter, a Senior Campaign Director at Color of Change, Dr. Hany Farid, Professor, at the University of California Berkeley, Mr. Neil Fried, former Chief Council for Communications and Technology on the Energy and Commerce Committee and Principal at Digital Frontiers Advocacy, and Mr. Spencer Overton, President of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies and Professor of Law at George Washington University. We wanna thank all of our witnesses for joining us today, we look forward to your testimony. At this time, the chair will recognize each witness for five minutes to provide their opening statement. And Ms. Collins-Dexter, you are now recognized for five minutes. And if you unmute. Ms. Collins-Dexter? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Hi (INAUDIBLE)-- 
DOYLE: --You're recognized for five minutes-- 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Thank you, good day Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden, Chairman Doyle, Ranking Member Latta, Chair Schakowsky, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, and members of the subcommittee. I am Brandi Collins-Dexter, Senior Campaign Director at Color Change and a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy Shorenstein Center, working on documenting racialized disinformation campaigns. 
For black communities, uncertainty is driven by distrust of mainstream media and a history of trauma from interactions from powerful institutions ranging from Madison, to law enforcement, to federal, state and local governments. Many of us have turned to social media as our church, our office water cooler and our political home. But unlike a physical space like a church or office, online you often don't know who's standing next to you, who is giving the sermon or how your data and information may be weaponized against you. While many corporate actors claim they are protecting free speech, this is an illusion. 
Every day, companies make a choice about what's allowed and what's not. When companies say they are not willing to remove certain things, what they're really saying is that addressing white nationalism, disinformation and anti-blackness simply don't rise to a level of urgency for them. Tech companies have routinely failed to uphold societal values, like transparency, accountability and fairness. 
We have seen misinformation about COVID-19 that endangers black lives. Back in February Color of Change alerted Twitter to COVID-19 misinformation that was spreading in black communities. The company only revised standards to address the dangers of misinformation after increased pressure and evidence gathered by Color of Change and other groups. Other tech companies have been slower to respond. A ""Plandemic"" video on YouTube suggesting that the pandemic is a false flag to force mandatory vaccines and microchips had 4.3 million views on YouTube and 930,000 engagements on Facebook. 
Every week, I sit on Zoom with my mom while she recounts various people in our family and friend network who have passed from COVID related issues, so I feel acutely the danger from these type of bias. 
At Color of Change, we have collected hundreds and hundreds of complaints from our members about censorship, harassment and biorac--biracial threats that they have received on Facebook. On the platform we often see conspiracy theories coupled with threats and calls to violence. The most popular of those conspiracy theories are those involving anti-Semitic tropes about George Soros and black activist groups. The idea that black people are puppets has been played out by white supremacists like David Duke to undermine the credibility and impact the black organizations but more--beyond credibility, it puts our lives in physical danger. 
Members of Congress, please move quickly to fix our democracy before it's irretrievably broken. I urge you to convene a series of civil rights focus hearings with high level executives from all major companies with particular focus on those trafficking of disinformation. Restore funding for the Office Of Technology Assessment, in order to help Congress tackle issues such as data privacy, tech election protection and set up infrastructure that can facilitate deeper investment in US based innovation and entrepreneurship, to combat disinformation and other data hostile practices. Ensure that regulators have every power at their disposal to ensure the safety of consumers and users on tech platforms. We support a consumer watchdog agency that is resourced to ensure we are all able to have control and protection of our data and that there is a competitive digital marketplace. 
And finally, Congress should affirmatively empower and resource the Federal Trade Commission to enforce anti-trust laws against technology oligarchs. The sheer amount of data and information amassed by tech companies, the inability of companies like Facebook and Google to be regulated at scale and the stakes online in the voting booth and on our streets require actionable steps towards breaking up companies. 
Congress is charged with making decisions, policies and laws that make real our joint aspiration for a more perfect union, that establishes justice, ensures domestic tranquility, provides for the common defense and promotes the general welfare so that the blessings of liberty can ring true for all of us. This cannot happen when democracy is corrupted. Uncontrolled tech companies pose significant threats to democracy and freedom in the US, and around the world. We must move with collective urgency to ensure that our data and physical bodies are protected on and offline. Thank you so much for your time. 
DOYLE: Thank you for your testimony. The chair now recognizes Dr. Farid, you're recognized for five minutes. 
FARID: Chairs, ranking members and members of both subcommittees, thanks for the opportunity to speak with you today on these incredibly important issues. Acknowledging the internet had had a remarkable impact on our lives and society, many educational entertaining and inspiring things have emerged in the past two decades in innovation. 
But at the same time, many horrific things have emerged; a massive proliferation of child sexual abuse material, the spread and radicalization of domestic and international terrorists, the distribution of illegal and deadly drugs, the proliferation of mis and disinformation campaigns designed to sew civil unrest, incite violence and disrupt Democratic elections, the proliferation or dangerous, hateful and deadly conspiracy theories, the routine harassment of women in underrepresented groups in the forms of threats, of sexual violence, and revenge and non-consensual pornography, small to large scale fraud, and spectacular failures to protect the personal and sensitive data. 
How in 20 years did we go from the promise of the internet, to democratize access to knowledge and make the world more understanding and enlightened, to this litany of daily horrors? Due to a combination of naivete, ideology, willful ignorance and a mentality of growth at all costs, the titans of tech have simply failed to install proper safeguards on their services. We can and we must do better when it comes to contending with some of the most violent, harmful, dangerous, hateful and fraudulent content online. We can and we must do better when it comes to contending with a misinformation apocalypse that has emerged over the past few years. The COVID global pandemic for example, has been an ideal breeding ground for online misinformation. 
Social media traffic has reached an all-time record as people are forced to remain at home, often idle, anxious and hungry for information. The resulting spike in COVID related misinformation is of grave concern to health professionals. The World Health Organization for example has listed this infodemic in its top priorities to contain the pandemic. Over the past few months, we have measured a troubling wide reach in belief in COVID related misinformation that is highly partisan and is more prevalent in those that consume news primarily on social media. 
We find that the amount of misinformation believed by those with social media (INAUDIBLE) their main source of news is 1.4 times greater than others, and the amount of misinformation believe--believed by those on the right of the political spectrum is two times greater than those on the left. Even prior to the current pandemic, the FBI announced last year that fringe conspiracy theories are a domestic terrorist threat due to the increasing number of violent incidents motivated by such beliefs. 
At the same time, YouTube continues to knowingly and actively promote fringe and dangerous conspiracies. At its peak in late 2018, we measured that almost 10 percent of recommended videos on YouTube's informal and news channels were conspiratorial in nature. Because 70 percent of all watched videos on YouTube are recommended by YouTube, their recommendation algorithm is responsible for the spread of conspiracies and misinformation. 
Now Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has tried to frame the issue or reigning in mis and disinformation as not wanting to be the arbiter of truth. This entirely misses the point. The point is not about--only about truth or falsehood but about algorithmic amplification. The point is that social media decides what is relevant by recommending it every day to their billions of users. 
The point is that social media has learned that outrageous, divisive, conspiratorial content increases engagement. The point is that all my content providers could simply decide that they value trusted information over untrusted information, respectful over hateful, and unifying over devise and in turn fundamentally change the divisiveness fueling and misinformation distributing machine that is social media today. 
If advertisers that are the fuel behind social media took a stand against online abuses they could withhold their advertising dollars to insist on real change, standing in the way of this much needed change is a lack of corporate leadership, a lack of competition, a lack of regulatory oversight, and a lack of education among the general public. Responsibility, therefore, to regain civility and trust online falls on the private sector, government regulators and we, the general public. Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions. 
DOYLE: I thank the gentleman for his testimony. The chair now recognizes Neil Freild--Fried, Neil welcome back to the committee, always good to see how one of our own back to business. You're now recognized for five minutes. 
FRIED: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden, Chairman Doyle, Ranking Member Latta, Chair Schakowsky, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify. After 10 years as communications and technology council to this committee, it's an honor to be on this side of the witness table, albeit virtually. I've been involved in the Section 230 debates for a while now, since 1999, and welcome the opportunity to share my views. Those views are my own, I have no client on Section 230 matters. I come not to bury(PH) Section 230, but to improve it. I recommend restoring a duty of care online by requiring platforms to take reasonable, good faith steps to prevent illicit use of their services, as a condition of receiving Section 230 protection. 
This would better protect users as well as address competition concerns and it would do so without regulating the internet, without taking away the platform's content moderation safe harbor and without raising government censorship issues. Growing frustration with the internet stems in large part from the lack of accountability of platforms as well as online intermediaries such as domain name providers and reverse proxy services. Increased transparency would help as would legislation restoring access to the WHOIS information needed to catch illicit actors. 
Full--fully realizing that the internet we all aspire to however will also require recalibrating Section 230. So long as platforms can facilitate illicit activity with impunity, we are fighting a losing battle. Despite claims that Section 230 encourages content moderation, it actually does the opposite. Congress gave platforms a content liability shield so they would wield a content moderation sword. 
Although Section 230(c)(2) creates a safe harbor for content moderation, Section 230(c)(1) eliminates liability even if the platforms don't moderate content. In other words, they reap the benefits of the shield, even when they drop the sword. Thus, while Section 230(c) is called the Good Samaritan Provision, it still protects platform when they behave like bad Samaritans profiting from advertising around unlawful behavior while sitting on their hands without legal consequence. This is aggravating illicit activity online, everything from fraud to the spread of child pornography. 
Ordinarily, a business has a duty of care to prevent people from using its services to harm others. Section 230 however, eliminates this duty even when the platforms negligently, recklessly, or willfully disregard illicit activity. This puts the internet users in harm's way and often leaves victims without a remedy, in light of the anonymous nature of the internet. The platforms say they are taking responsible steps to curb illicit activity. They--that may be true in some cases, but why should their judgment be beyond judicial scrutiny? Section 230 also affects competition by letting platforms avoid the ordinary business costs of preventing harm. This gives them an unfair advantage over their competitors, they can grow more recklessly in both scale and scope which also gives them market power to negotiate aggressive terms in their favor. 
They can generate profit from advertising around elicit activity and they can ignore harms that their users cause to their competitors. One way to preserve the benefits of Section 230 while fixing its harms would be to restore a duty of care. This could be achieved by requiring platforms to take reasonable, good faith steps to curb illicit activity as a condition of receiving protection. Doing so would mean platforms do not enjoy protection when they negligently, recklessly or knowingly facilitate illicit activity. Such a solution also avoids harm that critics attribute to Section 230 reform. First it preserves the content moderation safe harbor the platforms say they need to continue carrying user-generated content. 
Second, it requires no new regulation of the internet. Platforms would still have discretion over their business models on the front-end but would appropriately be held accountable on the back end if they used that discretion poorly. That potential backend accountability would prompt responsibility by design. Third, it doesn't rely on government determined content rules, avoiding First Amendment claims, forth, any evaluation of reason over this will factor in the resources available to a platform ensuring smaller platforms are not unreasonably burdened as they try to grow. In the meantime, the US should refrain from including Section 230 type language in trade deals, to do otherwise would export the harms we are experiencing here to foreign citizens and to US companies abroad. And because the internet is global, lax standards abroad also harm US citizens and business here. I thank the committee again for providing me the opportunity to appear today and welcome any questions. 
DOYLE: Thank you Mr. Fried, the chair now recognizes Mr. Overton for five minutes. 
OVERTON: Thank you very much-- 
DOYLE: --Mr. Overton, you're recognized for-- 
OVERTON: --chairs, ranking members and members of the committee, I thank you for inviting me to testify. My name is Spencer Overton, I'm the President of The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies which was founded in 1970 and is America's black think tank. I'm also a tenured law professor at GW, specializing in voting rights and I recently published academic research on voter suppression through social media. Disinformation on social media presents a real danger to moc--to democracy, both domestic and foreign actors use disinformation to divide Americans along racial lines. They use data and psychology to play on people's deepest fears and create an ""Us"" versus ""Them"" discourse. 
According to a recent Gallup/Knight Foundation survey, 81 percent of Americans believe that social medial companies should never allow intentionally misleading information on elections and political issues. 230, Section 230 clearly gives social media companies authority to remove disinformation, and they should use that authority to do a better job and stopping disinformation. So, some social media companies will say they don't remove disinformation because they wanna protect speech or be viewpoint neutral. But the harms that result are not neutral for communities of color. For example, in 2016 you'll remember several Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube accounts looked like they were African American operated, but in fact, they were operated by the Russian internet Research Agency. At--at first, the fake accounts built trust by showcasing black achievements, later they started posting on police violence and other structural inequalities. 
Then, near election day after they had built a large following, the fake accounts urged black voters to protest by boycotting the election and not voting. Now, we don't know how many black voters stayed home because of this disinformation, but we do know that 2016 marked the most significant decline in black voter turnout on record. Even though the Russians infiltrated different groups--you know a variety of groups, conservative, liberal, second amendment, LGBT, Latino, policing, Muslim Am--Muslim American groups, even though they did all that, this harm was not neutral for black communities. 
For example, while Black people make up just 13 percent of the US population, Black audiences accounted for over 38 percent of the Facebook ads purchased by the Russians, and almost half of the user clicks. Also, the Russians scheme discouraged voting among African Americans, right, but not those other groups. It's not neutral for our nation's most valuable companies to profit off of discrimination against historically marginalized communities. Now recently President Trump signed an executive order that attempted to increase the legal liability for social media companies that moderated objectionable content by President Trump and his followers. This type of retaliation discourages social media companies from stopping disinformation and allows for more disinformation that divides Americans. 
Although President Trump's executive order is--is problematic, right, the status quo just clearly, it is not working. The types of dis--disinformation and voter suppression schemes we saw in 2016 are continuing in 2020. Facebook has even argued that federal civil rights laws don't apply to Facebook. Even in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, there exists a real question about whether social media companies will address their own systemic shortcomings and fully embrace civil rights principles. I hope the civil right--the social media companies will fully adopt these civil rights principles and use their existing legal authority to prevent disinformation and voter suppression. If legal reforms are needed however, these debates should occur in Congress and--and should include the voices of communities of color who have been disproportionately harmed by targeted voter suppression, and other disinformation campaigns. Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion today. 
DOYLE: Thank you very much. I wanna thank all the panelists for their testimony and-and note for the record that they all were able to do it under five minutes. So, the--on the committee, they'll endeavor to follow their good example and not take any longer than five minutes for our questions. So, we're going to move on to member questions. Each member will have five minutes to ask questions of our witnesses, and I will start by recognizing myself for five minutes. 
Ms. Collins-Dexter, in your testimony you talked about the dangers of tech companies' reluctance to regulate disinformation from prominent figures. Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his decision not to moderate inaccurate statements made by President Trump regarding voting by mail and his glorification of violence, when he said to people protesting the murder of George Floyd ""When the looting starts the shooting starts."" Those words have a long history of abetting bigotry and police brutality in this country. Just yesterday, the president threatened protestors in Washington, DC with violence. What are online platforms culpable for when they allow this kind of content to be posted and shared by their most prominent users? And what do you think the president's intent was when he signed the executive order to prevent online censorship as the White House described it? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Thank you, congressman. There's so much at stake with people's lives when disinformation is allowed to rule the day and particularly, it doesn't matter when tech companies enforce the rules with people that have 10, or 20, or 100 followers, if the people that have thousands and millions of followers are allowed to peddle disinformation. And so, in terms of vote by mail, we know for a fact that--you know 80 percent of Americans support vote by mail. We've seen swells in voter turnouts in places like I live, like Baltimore. It has actually no impact on partisan turnout. I know that's not important to anyone here, but it's actually important for everybody in our democracy to be able to engage in the business of voting. And so, when it's left--all of these allegations that vote by mail is a fraud it--it turns people out--off, it--it hinders our ability to have like safe voting conditions in November while we're still dealing with COVID, and it--it really does do a disservice to I think, the work that Congress has invested in, in ensuring that everybody can engage in our democracy. 
In terms of the threats we personally have dealt with a--an increased number of threats to our lives as individuals, as--and as an organization, I think MoveOn has actually found that in a--after monitoring 25,000 comments in certain right wing groups in particular there were 207 calls to violence and mu--murder that were actually identified, which I can share with folks if they're interested afterwards. But like, we see how things that are said online have a deep impact on our safety offline. As far as--as what the president--you know, his thinking, I--you know I would hate to speculate what anybody thinks internally, but-- 
DOYLE: --I understand and--and you don't need to do that. I do wanna ask Mr. Overton a question too before my time is up. Mr. Overton, in your recent law review article entitled State Power To Regulate Social Media Companies and Voter Suppression in minority communities using targeted ads on Facebook and other platforms, we saw on--held hearings on the devastating effect of these efforts in 2016 and--and I have grave concerns about the 2020 election. 
You argued that the steps taken by online platforms to enable and tailor the targeting of prospective classes such as Black Americans with paid advertisements and promoted posts constitutes a material contribution to the distribution of these ads, and should make these online platforms liable under state voter suppression laws. Does Congress need to clarify Section 230 to make it clear that platforms that enable these kinds of civil rights violations are liable, not only under federal law, but under state law as well? 
OVERTON: Thank you so much and you're absolutely right. We're not necessarily talking about the speech of the third parties as you point out, we're talking about the platforms themselves. They are materially participating by using their algorithms to target communities of color. So, an employment ad goes to white folks but not to black folks. Voter suppression ads target at black folks and not other people and that is materially participating in the discrimination which is not what--which is not immunity that 230 covers. 
So, courts have not explicitly talked about that and if Congress opens up 230, certainly it should make it explicitly clear that this type of behavior is not protected by 230. Unfortunately, Facebook has argued that it is protected and that they should be able to target ads away from black communities and employment opportunities to just--to just white folks. 
DOYLE: Thank you, and I see my time has expired, right on the button. I will now recognize my good friend Mr. Latta, for his five minutes. You need to unmute Bob, there you go. 
LATTA: Well thank you Mr. Chairman, and I wanna thank you again for holding today's hearing and I'd like to start this with Mr. Fried. this morning I sent a letter to several federal agencies and questioning the information about how those agencies use information from the WHOIS database to combat illegal activity online. Through the ambiguous and overly broad nature of the European Union's GDPR access to WHOIS information has been restricted for many third-party organizations that use this information to identify bad actors online. Access to WHOIS is especially important during this pandemic, as we have seen an increase of online misinformation and fraud targeting consumers. Our first question, how did access to WHOIS information prior to the implementation--implementation of GDPR help in the takedown of illegal content? 
FRIED: Thank you, Mr. Latta. Two ways, one is fairly obvious. If you found someone engaging in illicit activity though a website, you could try and figure out who holds that website, and so it's good in sort of captioning those engaged in illicit activity. But what many people don't realize, it's also used to prevent illicit activity. Because you can track patterns, if you see that a lot of illicit activity has occurred from a particular website or from certain people who are holding a website, well that web--what web managers can do is create sort of black lists and say ""We know that this actor is going things nefarious, they're engaging in fraud, they're engaging in cyberattacks."" And corporate or law enforcement can then proactively prevent those entities from creating further havoc. So, it's both catching criminals and preventing crime. 
LATTA: Well, and also, just as a follow-up because it says withholding that impetus access to the WHOIS information from certain groups reduce the action that domain name providers are able to take against that illegal content? 
FRIED: Yes, and so his is also very important. So obviously, law enforcement is critical here, but law enforcement only has so many resources. There was a--a very large community of cyber experts to track illicit behavior and they can often flag illicit activity, both it has already occurred or as we've just discussed that may be happening soon because they can see certain actors who are engaged in illicit activity in the past about to do something again and they can warn public safety, law enforcement that something is amiss and you lose that as well. So, without WHOIS it really hurts the ability of domain--domain name providers to--to release this information at least because of the--the way the EU is--GDPR is begin overapplied. 
LATTA: So, and just finally, could you briefly summarize the types of societal problems that could be better confronted by restoring that ac--the access to the WHOIS information? 
FRIED: Everything we're experiencing now from fraud to illicit sale of drugs, to cyberattacks, any illicit activity online often either has a website component or it has IP addresses that you can find through the WHOIS data. So, any illicit activity the scourge of misinformation of fraud, of cyberattacks, all could be aided com--combating that could all be aided if we had better access to WHOIS data like we used to have. 
LATTA: Well thank you. Mr. Farid, there is much discussion for companies to be transparent about their terms of service and how they enforce their policies. But recently, social media companies seem to be creating new policies ad hoc to fit their political agenda, arguably making these companies arbiters of speech on their platform. So if artificial intelligence and human review are important elements to ensure that harmful and illegal content gets taken down, but how do you address the human bias element to make sure that Americans are able to exercise their right of free speech? 
FARID: I think the bias question is important Congressman. I think it's important for us to talk about it. Let me say that there is no compelling evidence that we have seen to date that shows that there is a consistent bias. You can always take the individual cases and show that there's a problem here or there, but the consistent, disproportionate affecting of one group or another, politically, we have not seen. 
So, I think the answer to your question is, we need transparency, we need transparencies in the rules, we need transparencies in how they're being enforced, we need better reporting, we need more consistency and we need more investment. The fact is that the tech companies have not invested in the technologies and in the services, they need to moderate their platforms because frankly, it's bad for business. 
And so, we need for them to put more effort into this and for it to be transparent and clear and consistent application of the rules. And without as we've been talking about, real reform in 230, not removing it as you said in your opening remark, but real reform, I think that's gonna be very difficult to achieve. 
LATTA: Well thank you very much Mr. Chairman, and my time is set to expire, and I yield back the balance. 
DOYLE: I thank the gentleman. Chair now recognizes Ms. Schakowsky for five minutes. You need to unmute, Jan. 
SCHAKOWSKY: Okay, Doc--Mr. Fried, I--I just want to point out, you said that you hope that 230 and the--and the liability shield would not be in foreign pol--in trade agreements. And as you know, as I was--I--and I know 'cause I was on the working group, it is in the US/Canada /Mexico Trade Agreement, and I think we need to work on a bipartisan way to make sure that we are keeping it out of future agreements. because it will make it harder for us then to moderate 230. So, I hope we can work together on--on that. 
As Mark Zuckerberg noted so clearly when he testified before Congress, Facebook and other social media platforms make money by selling ads. And in--in many of our consumer protection hearings, someone uses the now kind of cliche line, ""If you're not paying for the product, you are the product."" Simply put, the longer you stay on an app, the more money the company makes. And what gets and keeps people online as Dr. Farid noted in his testimony, content that is ""Novel and provoking"" such as conspiracy theories and snake oil, et cetera and--and COVID-19 hoaxes and things about protesters are--draw viewers. 
So, let me ask you, Dr. Farid, can you discuss why many of the big platforms allow amplification of conspiracies and disinformation to happen, and how the business model seems to be benefiting them? 
FARID: Thank you, Congresswoman, you said it absolute right that social media is in the--is in the engagement and attention business. So, they profit when we spend more time on the platform, they collect more data from us, and they deliver ads. They didn't set out to fuel misinformation and hate and divisiveness, but that's what the algorithms learned. So when you do A-B testing, ""If we show you this do you spend more or less tie on the platform,"" they--algorithms have learned that the hateful, the divisive, the conspiratorial, the outrageous and the novel keeps on the platforms longer. 
And since that is the driving factor for--for profit, that's what the algorithms do. Now they could change the algorithms, they could just say ""Look it's not all about engagement, it's not all about profit it's about a healthier ecosystem democracy and society,"" and they can just value something else in what they are optimizing for. But the core poison here congresswoman, which is what you're getting at, is the business model. The business model is that when you keep people on the platform, you profit more and that is fundamentally at odds with our societal and democratic goals. 
SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. You know at--we hear over and over again from big tech that ""Well, we're gonna fix this, self-regulation really works"" and I don't think that--I personally don't think that's--that's true. Congress routinely, routinely regulates commercial activity to prevent harm, harmful products from being sold, stop fraud and deter illegal discrimination. So, when a company is profiting from its de--decisions to push counterfeit products or face--facilitating housing discrimination they should be held accountable. So, Mr. Overton, and--and maybe we could also hear from Ms. Collins-Dexter, do I have any time left? Yeah, I do. You testified that the statue--that the status--okay, let me try again. You testified that the status quo for Section 230 is not working to protect civil rights. Can you expand a little bit on the civil rights aspect? 
OVERTON: Yes, thank you. So, it's not working because in part, the algorithms are--are--have a discriminatory impact and effect, even when they take explicit racial groups in targeting out, they're still profiting from that in terms of employment. But when we look in other areas, we see voter suppression that continues to exist. Something was just uncovered in terms of a group in Ghana, in Nigeria, targeting Black Americans with disinformation. So, we see several examples it's very unlike COVID. Certainly, there was some misinformation with COVID but the thought was, ""Hey there's public health here at stake we really also need to be focused about--on the health of our democracy and--and we need platforms to be serious about that. 
SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, my time has expired. 
DOYLE: --The gentlelady's time has expired-- 
SCHAKOWSKY: Yeah, so maybe you can--we can talk offline. Thank you very much. 
DOYLE: Okay, thank you. The chair now recognizes Mr. Shimkus for five minutes. Is Mr. Shimkus here? Okay, let's go to Dr. Burgess, you're recognized for five minutes. I'm sorry is the chair here, is Mr. Walden here? Is the chairman here, is Mr. Walden here, Bob (PH)? Okay. Dr. Burgess, you're recognized for five minutes. 
UNKNOWN: Mr. Doyle, both Mr. Walden and Mr. Burgess are at Rules Committee at the moment. 
DOYLE: Okay, is Mr. Shimkus present? Okay, we're down to what, Mr. Guthrie? 
GUTHRIE: Mr. Guthrie. 
DOYLE: Yeah, Mr. Guthrie. 
GUTHRIE: --That's me-- 
DOYLE: (INAUDIBLE) 
GUTHRIE: Thank you Mr. Chair, I appreciate it very much (INAUDIBLE)-- 
DOYLE: I--I think we had met before on the Rules Committee but-- 
GUTHRIE: Yeah, they-- 
DOYLE: (INAUDIBLE) 
GUTHRIE: Yeah, they were, I'm standing by, thank you very much. Dr. Farid, my first question's for you. Welcome back to the committee, we all--we like hearing from you and enjoy our discussions, but we often hear that there are difficult judgment calls on content moderation. Do you believe these large social media companies currently possess the tech--technolog--tech--technological means to better moderate illicit content on their platforms? And if they do, why aren't they using them? 
FARID: Thank you congressman, it's good to see you again and good to be back here. I don't actually think they have very good technology. (INAUDIBLE) the technology can't be developed it's that they just haven't developed it, they haven't prioritized it. So, I'll give you a couple of examples (INAUDIBLE) on YouTube, you are not allowed to post adult legal pornography. Perfectly protected speech by the way, and nobody gives Facebook and YouTube a hard time for eliminating that content which they do by the way very effectively because it's bad for business. Advertisers don't wanna advertise against that content (INAUDIBLE) information. When the DMCA was passed, we got very good at removing copyright infringements because the law insisted on it. 
So when there has been an insistence to remove content or that it was important for businesses, the companies have actually gotten very good, (INAUDIBLE) prioritize misinformation, disinformation (INAUDIBLE) but I'll also point out that it's not always entirely about either removing the content or not it's also about the amplification. So, what they could chose to do even they don't have the ability to detect fake news, misinformation, disinformation is they could reprioritize the algorithms so that trusted information is brought on--above untrusted information. 
So, you could think about the problem in two ways, it's not about necessarily detecting fake information, but it's also--could be about detecting trustworthy information, or civil infor--or civil discourse. And so, it's simply not a priority for them and despite the claims by the way, (INAUDIBLE) made the same claims about copyright infringement but as soon as the laws were passed, well they got really good at it. And they did--the same case about child sexual abuse material and when the public pressure escalated so much, they eventually started removing the content, under--after years and years of denial that it was possible. 
GUTHRIE: Well thank you that's--that's very helpful than you very much. And also, question to you again, I app--I appreciate your collaboration with Microsoft to develop PhotoDNA over a decade ago. When you work with these companies, what are the benchmarks you would advise these companies to meet, and--such as investment and personnel? 
FARID: Yeah, that's a great question congressman, so--you know one of the--one of the hardest things with these companies is there's a lack of transparency. And so, we don't know how much child sexual abuse material, how much terrorism material, how much illegal drugs and misinformation goes through their network. 
So, the first thing is to really get good at reporting and understanding the flow of disinformation through your services so that as we deploy technologies, we can do better. So, here's what I can tell you is that it--and all of the major companies dealing with these things are not a priority. And so, whether it's human--human moderators or whether it's research, or whether it's technology deployment it is simply not being prioritized. 
Now, the thing you will always hear is, ""Well, we do this, we do this, we do this, and we do this."" And the answer is ""That's fine, but what they're not telling is what they're not doing."" (INAUDIBLE) call for transparency on the flood of disinformation on (INAUDIBLE) this and to reprioritize the priorities in the current companies so that we start dealing with the harmful content, at least as effectively as we do for making money. 
GUTHRIE: Okay, thank you and I have about a minute left, so Mr. Fried, I'd like to ask you this, appreciate your answers Dr. Farid. Mr. Fried, where do you see emerging technology such as artificial intelligence being used to help combat disinformation particularly during situations like the current pandemic? Do you believe AI can be used to identify and remove illicit content from platforms such as disinformation campaigns and counterfeit products? I have about a minute for you to respond, so. 
FRIED: (INAUDIBLE) rule out any technological tools that can help, I--I would caution that depending on what kind of artificial intelligence you're talking about like algorithms right, these also can cause a problem. Some of them got us into this we're in now. So absolutely, we should look at all the options, but (INAUDIBLE) both the concerns as well as the benefits. 
GUTHRIE: Okay, and I'll just follow-up then. Do you believe that--second's to Dr--to Mr. Farid, do you believe that Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act creates a disincentive for platforms implementing artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies to address this? 
FRIED: So, Professor Farid hit on this already which is that the law could increase the incentive to solve problems. And right now, because the liability protection applies even if they do nothing, there is less legal incentive for them to solve that problem. 
GUTHRIE: So, it's not a disincentive, just no incentive to do so? 
FRIED: There is less of a legal incentive, that is correct. 
GUTHRIE: Thank you very much. Well I have about 10 seconds left, I appreciate your answers, I appreciate you being here, and I yield back. 
DOYLE: The gentlemen yields back. The chair now recognizes Mr. Rush for five minutes. Mr. Rush, you're recognized. Bob, you need to unmute. Mr. Rush, if you can hear me, you need to unmute your microphone and your video's off too, so you may wanna check that also. Okay, I think we're gonna go to Mr. Butterfield. Mr. Butterfield, we'll recognize you for five minutes and we'll come back to Mr. Rush, if he gets back online. Mr. Butterfield? Isn't technology wonderful? Mr. Butterfield? Okay, Mr. Rush, can you hear me? 
RUSH: I certainly can now, I can hear you, and I can see you Mr. Chairman. 
DOYLE: Okay you--you are now recognized for five minutes, my friend. 
RUSH: Well thank you very much Mr. Chairman, and I am delighted to participate in this hearing, and I want to welcome all of our witnesses. Ms. Collins-Dexter, I've introduced COVID-19 testing reaching (PH) and contacting everyone which his called the Trace Act, which is meant to provide contact tracing and testing in the face of this pandemic. We've got almost 70 co-sponsors. And this bill has been (INAUDIBLE) to an incredible amount of disinformation and distortions and frankly, downright lies, all on social media platforms. This occurred primarily due to the bill number H. R 6666 and the bill (INAUDIBLE) would focus on the African American community. When my staff engaged 10 companies to prevent the spread of dis--disinformation, and they were told that the posts represent people, especially their opinions on legislation and therefore, no violating community guidelines. While I fully support a free and (INAUDIBLE) discussion I believe it is also important to recognize that disinformation can have real and significant consequences. I wonder then, where and how do we draw the line between opinion and disinformation? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yes, I think it's extremely important that we draw that line, thank you, congressman. We--a difference of opinion is I think, ""Taxes should go here"" versus--you know ""Pay less taxes"" and there's a number of ways in which we have to be invested in a free marketplace of ideas. 
But when it comes to information that's put forward that directly endangers people's lives on and offline, in the case of--of your bill, congressman, we're seeing right now that from the data we do know that 60 percent of cases and of--depending of the state of deaths from COVID-19 are Black people. There is a high number of stakes involved with the amount of disinformation we've seen floating around and particularly when Congress people are trying to put forward bills that would increase the data and awareness of folks around this, and other things. It--it's extraordinarily important that we do say that there's a difference between opinion and there's a different between the need for facts in our society. 
RUSH: Yes, Ms--Ms. (INAUDIBLE) Collins-Dexter, AI trained--you said in your testimony that ""AI trained to identify hate speech may actually amplify racial myres (PH)--bias, rather."" This is very concerning to me and may of my colleagues. What could and should Congress do to prevent and mitigate this outcome? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah, so I mean I think again like with the issue of AI we've found time and time again racial bias in--in healthcare software, in crime software, Google's hate speech has a--a AI racial bias problem as well as the technology that was used on Facebook. And so, I think--and also, we see that a lot of content moderators are contractors, are not necessarily in the country and not able to really do their job at full scale. 
And so I think that again when I point to some of the ways on which I would see Congress moving forward, I think something like bringing back GAO would be really great to--to help ensure that Congress is informed and able to make good decisions around how to move forward on decisions like AI monitoring. 
RUSH: Yeah, Mr. Chairman, I--I think that my time has been expired, and I yield back. 
DOYLE: Well I wanna thank the gentleman for yielding us back 43 seconds, setting such a good example. I can see my good friend JS on the screen, so Mr. Shimkus, you are recognized for five minutes. 
SHIMKUS: Thank you Mr. Chairman, it's great hearing and thank for the panelists for being there. I wanna direct my questions to Neil Fried, it's good to have and see him again, of course working with the committee for many years. And I think we all can agree that some content decisions are complex, but you suggest companies have not met the bar when it comes to clearly illegal content, or violation of terms of service. Do the current incentives under Section 230 encourage companies to proactively engage in enforcing their terms of service, or are simply waiting for users to flag content? 
DOYLE: Thank you. And you're gonna be right next after Dr. Shimkus. (INAUDIBLE). 
FRIED: So, despite the claim that it actually encourages content moderation, it doesn't. What it does do, right in the--in the safe harbor for content moderation is it gets rid of the disincentive caused by the prodigy case. But what that provision gives, essentially 230(c)(1) takes away by saying ""You can't be held liable for anything anyway."" So, it actually (INAUDIBLE) there's no incentive to be--legal incentive to be proactive. 
SHIMKUS: Okay we had some interruption there. So, but let me just follow-up. And if companies decide to engage proactively, how do--how do those incentives prevent the engagement from being entirely one-sided at the whim of the employees making those decisions? 
FRIED: So, the discretion is completely theirs. There is no--most every other business who's not platform will have some duty of care. They could be held culpable if they act recklessly. That does not apply to the platforms. So that it is completely within their discretion, there is not a legal incentive for them to actually act. 
SHIMKUS: Great, my--my family's fourth generation Lithuanian Americans and it's--I follow a lot of the Baltic issues as you know, and disinformation that comes from Russia throughout Eastern Europe but particularly the Baltic countries. So, the Lithuanian Government has created an initiative called ""Debunk.eu"" to combat --to combat disinformation. They found that in this COVID crisis there had been a significant increase in online disinformation with stories that have stirred up Russophobia, and the Baltic to push false narratives and the failures of the Baltic Governments and spread messaging that COVID-19 is destroying the European Union. Are there any lessons the U.S. can learn from projects like Debunk.eu? 
FRIED: So Mr. Shimkus, I'm not familiar with that particular project, but clearly if that were to reveal information about websites that are engaged in misinformation, it would be great to have access to WHOIS information to try and track them down, see the patterns that exist, that the cyber experts often try to do and prevent that misinformation from spreading. Unfortunately, we don't have WHOIS access because of an overapplication of GDPR. 
SHIMKUS: Yeah and I'm trying to look for my clock to check my time, and if I have available time if anyone of the other panelists wanna address that, that's combatting informat--I've got two minutes left, combatting information with information is kind of what the Lithuanians are doing. And so, it's--you know fighting that space. Does anybody else--maybe I see Ms. Collins-Dexter shaking her head, would you like to comment on that? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah, I think it's extremely important when we look at models around the globe that there are countries that are taking this very seriously, the issue of disinformation. We've seen how that's played out in the Ukraine and some of the place that you've mentioned. This is part of the reason why I've advocated for a data protection agency. But in terms of like, looking around and seeing, ""What are the lessons, how can we get this right,"" We have to have a vested interest in getting it right. 
SHIMKUS: Thanks. Mr. Farid? 
FARID: Thank you Congressman. Good information, trustworthy information are necessary, but they are--they're--they're not sufficient conditions. So, we need that information, but we also then need the platform algorithms to allow them to surface. If those get buried by the recommendation algorithms they don't do us any good. So, I think we need two things, we need that trustworthy information, and then we need for them to be valued and promoted above the untrusted information that we're talking about. 
SHIMKUS: Great. I have 43 seconds left. Mr. Chairman, thank you and I'll yield back my time. 
DOYLE: I thank the gentleman for yielding back. The chair now recognizes Mr. Butterfield for five minutes. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you very much Mr. Chairman, thank you again for--for convening this very important hearing today, and thank you to the witnesses for your testimony. Mr. Overton, it's good to see you again, I've known you and of your work for many years now and thank you very much for your testimony. Let me ask you Mr. Overton, how does the diss--dissemination of information, disenfranchise marginalized communities? Would you break it down at a level so that the average person can understand that? 
OVERTON: Certainly. Thank you very much and thanks for your leadership and your service to our country. The unique nature of social media involves microtargeting and as a result, especially with ads, you can target particular groups. So for example, this is what the Russians did and some other folks do, targeting African Americans with particular messages, building trust, et cetera and then toward the end saying, ""Well, hey let's protest police brutality and let's protest systemic racism by saying home, and not voting."" That is a real problem and the microtargeting, so other people in the nation don't really know what's going on and these messages are targeted right at black folks, that is a part of the problem. Now, microtargeting has some good traits if you think about sick--sickle cell anemia, other things, we wanna help people in certain ways, but it--it can also be used for negative purposes. 
BUTTERFIELD: Well it seems that we need to correct this issue and we need to move pretty fast. So, what--what in your opinion, what are the platforms just plain failing to do, and what do we need to do immediately? 
OVERTON: Well, the platforms were very serious in--in terms of COVID-19. They did things like look to outside experts and--and third party credible entities to figure out what information was good, what information was bad, they invested a lot of resources and took it more seriously than they have taken voting issues. 
So, the first thing is really platforms then themselves, need to step up to the plate. Second piece here is, they need to disclose information so that we understand what's going on in terms of the American public, both the schemes that are going on and how they're applying their standards so that disclosure at this point is important. And you know, there's a question, ""Can anything eb done in terms of law in the next few months,"" but--but certainly a hearing, pressing these companies is important. 
BUTTERFIELD: Let me next turn to Dr. Farid. Dr. Farid, how has the reluctance by some social media and tech companies to fact check content on their platforms actually exacerbated the spread of disinformation? 
FARID: Thank you, congressman. I--I think you're right when Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand that ""We don't wanna be the arbiters of truth,"" this is part of what the problem is we're facing in the misinformation apocalypse, but it's also as I said in my testimony completely missing the point. The point is not always partly about what's true and what's false but it's what's being amplified. 
The power of Facebook, the power of YouTube, the power of Twitter is in the recommendation engine and as Professor Overton was saying in the microtargeting of information. So I think there's a bit of a head fake being done here to say ""Well we don't wanna tell people what's real and what's not,"" when in reality, they are telling us on a daily basis what is relevant and what we should view. So that is where I think the out--the discussion should be had is what is being actively promoted and recommended and microtargeted, and then we can move away from some of the more difficult conversations of the gray area content being either true of false. 
BUTTERFIELD: Okay and I think you may have touched on this but let me just go ahead and--and put it you anyway. How would you recommend the tech companies take meaningful action to prevent the dissemination of--of disinformation on their platforms? I mean, not just rhetoric but they need to act quickly. 
FARID: I--I agree, and I have been deeply frustrated for over a decade in their response from everything from child sexual abuse to terrorism, to illegal drugs and misinformation and the reality is, they have not acted. And so, I think there should be a call of action to the advertisers. The reality is that the social media companies are more--almost entirely dependent on advertising dollars. 
There are 10 CEOs in the world who can wake up tomorrow and say, ""Enough is enough we are done with technology being weaponized, we will no longer advertise on these platforms."" And there is a slowly growing effort on that part, a--a number of companies have started to withhold advertising dollars, Disney has done it in the past with YouTube, because they failed to protect children. I think if we want action today, that's where the power is, is in the advertising dollars. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you Dr. Farid. I've run out of time and our chairman yields a pretty mean gala(PH). I yield back. 
DOYLE: I wanna thank the gentleman for yielding back. Okay, I see the doctor is back in the house, so we will recognize Dr. Burgess. 
BURGESS: Thank you--thank you chairman, and I appreciate the recognition. So Mr. Farid, let me ask you, I apologize for the fact that there are dual hearings going on, if you've already answered this I--I'll--I'll apologize to you in advance, but in your written testimony, you argued that Congress should restore duty of care by requiring the technology company to host--that hosts content to only receive the 230 immunity if they make a good faith effort to remove said illicit content. So, in your view, what--what does make up this good faith effort? 
FARID: So, the good faith effort is not as much (INAUDIBLE) as the--the real action, right? So, under a common law (INAUDIBLE) any company can be held culpable if they act negligently recklessly, for knowingly failing to prevent one user of its services to harm other users, right? 
FRIED: And so that act (INAUDIBLE) the lead protected to make sure that (INAUDIBLE). 
(AUDIO GAP) 
But the rule Section 230 says that no matter what happens (INAUDIBLE) cannot be held culpable, even if-- 
(AUDIO GAP) 
--no concept of (INAUDIBLE) problems. If we would be action--if we actually required the reasonable step I think this would largely solve itself. As Professor Farid mentioned, they'd have a legal incentive to act. 
And they will (INAUDIBLE) responsibly by design. They'll anticipate the risk, be more reasonable up front and certainly when they know of illicit activity they'll do more to stop it. So (INAUDIBLE) institutions will (INAUDIBLE) liability protection (INAUDIBLE) would encourage more responsible behavior (INAUDIBLE). 
(AUDIO GAP) 
BURGESS: You know--I--I had an opportunity just this week to have a conversation with our former colleague Chris Cox who was if I recall corrected one of the authors of this provision originally. And he suggested that the authority by the state AGs to enforce unfair or deceptive trade practices--mini FTCs I think he referred to them as. But they could be used to enforce content moderation policies as outlined in a--a terms and conditions. 
So, Mr. Fried if you could speak to that. 
FRIED: So, there is (INAUDIBLE) concern that the state action was preempted. So, it's not quite clear what the states will be able to do and I think that--the state (INAUDIBLE) about that. And Congress wanted it--might want to clarify. 
BURGESS: So, given the cross-voter applications on the internet and the way the technology works, where--where actually does the juris--jurisdiction then reside? 
FRIED: Well certainly if there's criminal activity in the state the state has jurisdiction. Its citizens are being harmed. I do point out that maybe jurisdiction over the (INAUDIBLE) harm. If there were (INAUDIBLE) applied to the online (INAUDIBLE)--so there are some jurisdiction (INAUDIBLE). But we've done that before and we can do that again. 
BURGESS: So, is--is this a vital option to get companies to comply with their own content moderation policies? 
FRIED: I--I think so. (INAUDIBLE) for the other industries, right? (INAUDIBLE) many of whom compete with the (INAUDIBLE). There are non-online media entities (INAUDIBLE) brick and mortar companies not in the media space. And they don't have this obligation and they deal with it. And so, I'm not sure why the platform shouldn't (INAUDIBLE). 230 works for the good (INAUDIBLE) but it's also shielding the bad (INAUDIBLE). We need to address the bad Samaritan problem. (INAUDIBLE) the incentives. 
BURGESS: So, it seems like anything change the applicability of Section 230 based on size of a technology company could create a barrier for entry for others who are just starting out and obviously much smaller. Is that a concern? 
FRIED: I actually don't think that. Because under a duty of care this (INAUDIBLE) much reasonable. And certainly, the resources of the (INAUDIBLE) are a factor in what (INAUDIBLE). A smaller (INAUDIBLE) has fewer resources. A smaller entity has fewer users. But when they're smaller (INAUDIBLE) need to constant moderation and won't (INAUDIBLE) they don't have the resources. (INAUDIBLE) as they (INAUDIBLE) the expectation grows with it. (INAUDIBLE) responsibility over time. They build their platform when they're small, we address the problems when they're big. The problem is (INAUDIBLE). 
They have very, very large (INAUDIBLE) we really weren't focused on it (INAUDIBLE). Right? And so now we have a much harder problem to solve. One very (INAUDIBLE) us to have (INAUDIBLE) which I think a duty of care can do. And (INAUDIBLE) because a smaller (INAUDIBLE). 
DOYLE: Gentleman's time has expired. 
BURGESS: I'd like to thank the Chairman. I'll yield back. 
DOYLE: Thank you. Gentleman yields back. Let me remind all members that in order to be recognized your video needs to be on and active. So, if you're in line waiting to be recognized please make sure you have your video on. I see that the chairman of our full committee has returned from the rules committee. So, it gives me great pleasure to recognize Mr. Pallone for five minutes. 
PALLONE: Thank you Chairman Doyle, and this is such an important hearing on disinformation and how it divides the nation. I'm--I constantly (INAUDIBLE) by Mark Zuckerberg that he doesn't want to be, and I quote, ""the arbiter of truth"". But I think that that absolutely misses the point. 
And I know that Dr. Farid is there and in his written testimony he talks about how certain disinformation or conspiracy theories are amplified on platforms like Facebook. And the problem caused by Facebook has nothing to do with truth and falsity in my opinion, it's about what they amplify or don't. And it may go to a fundamental problem with Facebook's business model. 
So last month the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled Facebook executive shut down efforts to make the site less divisive. And I'd like to introduce it for the record. It's here. And I think that this article shows that Facebook understand the problem but won't address it. I guess I should ask unanimous consent of you to enter it into the record, Mr. Chairman. 
DOYLE: Yeah, without objection so ordered. 
PALLONE: Thank you. So, let me ask Dr. Farid. Do you believe the major platforms understand that they are promoting disinformation and conspiratorial content, and could they address it if they wanted to? 
FARID: Thank you congressman. So first of all, I think you're absolutely right about the landscape here. The Wall Street Journal did a very good job of revealing what we've known for a long time, which is that Mark Zuckerberg the C-Suite and Facebook knows that they are peddlers of hate, divisiveness, conspiracies because it's good for business. So, they've known this for a long time. The algorithms have learned this to the tune of $70 billion last year in--in revenue. 
And they could do something about it. They absolutely could. But it would of course reduce engagement and therefore reduce profits. And so, there's just thi--this is what's sort of our problem with these business models of social media is that they're misaligned with individual societal and democratic goals. Because they have figured out that they can tap into the lowest common denominator of humans. 
So, it's like any other addictive substance, right? It--they--these things are tested in order to keep us addicted, in order to--to--to--to tap into the things that we are--are not necessarily positive for society. And so, we can blame us, and you should blame the users for this for--for falling into this trap. But the fact is that we are being manipulated by the algorithms in order for them to simply get our data and provide advertising dollars to us. 
PALLONE: Well thank you. So--I mean--these platforms may bias towards conspiracy theories. But I think the problem is made 10 times worse when important figures and government officials peddle disinformation or conspiracy and hate that feeds these platforms. 
So, let me ask Ms. Collins-Dexter, in your written testimony you discuss how some public figures peddle disinformation to the masses with few if any repercussions. And as we know, President Trump is one of those public figures. So, let me ask you, how has President Trump used social media to spread or amplify disinformation that is harmful to Black Americans and otherwise inflame racial tensions? 
And you also mention that social media companies like Facebook are not fact checking posts consistently, such as those related to mail in voting. And so, what is the effect of that inconsistent fact checking? So first with the racial tensions and second with the--you know--mail in voting as examples if you could Ms. Collins-Dexter. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yes, thank you Congressman. We've--we pointed out several different examples over the course of this in the ways in which commentary around protestors and this depiction of Black Lives Matters as a terrorist organization has had deep impacts in terms of like harms to people on the ground. 
But another way in which I've seen the President push disinformation is actually some of his early commentary on COVID-19 and his push that Lupus medication was actually what people should be using. Now if you look again disproportionately people are impacted by--black people are impacted by COVID. Also disproportionately impacted by Lupus and a number of other autoimmune disease that--it runs rampant in my family, for example. 
So that piece of disinformation allowed to stand that caused a run on Lupus medication actually actively like harmed people. My sister couldn't get her medication. There were a number of different issues. So that's just like one example I would raise. 
PALLONE: And what about the mail in ballots and--you know--the comments about that? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Again, that's danger. Like, we've talked about the fact that like vote by mail is very safe. There's research that shows that in elections it has .0025 percent chance of fraud or something like that. So, to promote that that is a fraudulent practice is--has implications. Also, for Black people going to polling places which we know are being closed down, standing in long lines not being able to engage in democracy safely. 
PALLONE: Thank you-- 
DOYLE: --The gentleman's time has expired. 
PALLONE: Thank you. 
DOYLE: Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the full committee. Mr. Walden, you're recognized for five minutes. 
WALDEN: Well thank you very much Doyle. And Chairman Pallone and I were both at the rules committee. So, I appreciate being worked in here and I'm--I'm sorry I wasn't able to give my opening statement myself. But I understand Ms. Brooks did a wonderful job with it. 
Mr. Farid, I think many of the issues related to content moderation by platforms could be solved if companies enforce their terms of service in a transparent, uniform, and equitable pattern. That's what makes it so disconcerting in this case of Google that we've read about that reportedly based action off inaccurate NBC reporting. And now just yesterday another egregious action by Twitter to block the President's Tweets. 
These recent actions make clear that the CEOs of these companies need to come before this committee to answer our questions. And if they will not come voluntarily then Mr. Chairman perhaps it's time we compel their attendance. 
Mr. Fried, free speech and content decisions are certainly tricky. And I'm--I'm certainly an advocate of the First Amendment. I have a degree in journalism. But how can we incentivize these companies to step up and apply their rules with more transparency and more uniformity? 
FRIED: Thank you Mr. Walden, good to see you. Certainly, transparency would be helpful. I know there is some discussion that--you know--a violation of the terms of service could be a contractual problem. There is some discussion I think of asking the FTC to step in and call it an unfair practice. So, you can certainly try that. 
One thing I suggest you look at is--and this was raised by DOJ--is whether Section 230 might actually even preempt FTC action. There's--there's open question. And if you look at the roommates dot com case which was mentioned sort of implicitly earlier--if the platform is itself acting in an illegal fashion and perhaps violating a term of service were that Congress' decision to--to make clearer is an illegal action unfair practice--then maybe under the roommates case the FTC could have jurisdiction. Because it's not--it's not a content moderation issue. 
I--I surmise however that the platforms will argue that no, no, no, this is about our content moderation not about our terms of service. And so, Section 230 preempts. So certainly, calling it unfair pre--unfair practice to violate the terms of service could be an issue. But I'm not sure how that interplays with Section 230 just yet. 
WALDEN: Yeah and I--I guess for the average consumer or user--pretty tough to take on these giants individually. And--and--and wage this battle-- 
FRIED: --Yes-- 
WALDEN: --This is bigger than city hall. 
FRIED: And keep in mind too again, I'm all for the transparency. But they control their terms of service. So, if they know that a violation of their terms of service could cause an FTC violation, they presumably would write their terms of service in a more generic way as to avoid liability under the--that sort of theory. 
So that's why I certainly think transparency helps. I fear we are going to have to address the 230 immunity to really solve this problem. 
WALDEN: Well it's--it's--I think it's long overdue in many respects. It was a law written decades ago in an era that didn't contemplate the modern communication technology (INAUDIBLE) scope and the power of these platforms. 
And--and I know it's not easy to quote unquote regulate speech. Because what one person finds offensive the other may say that's my right. And so, they're in--they're in a tricky position as well. But I know we've asked Google three pretty simple questions about this case involving the Federalist and--and just how are they notified? How--how did it work and all that and--and we still don't have--have answers back on--on that. And they were actually pretty simple questions. 
Mr. Farid, you--you mention how companies employ algorithmic amplification increase views of certain content that draws attention to their platform but need to prioritize algorithms to promote trusted information over misinformation. Should there be a heightened accountability for these platforms when it comes to amplified content in order to gain liability protection? And how do you incentivize these actions? 
And I know when--when I Chaired the committee we--we actually did a hearing on algorithms so members could better understand how they're created. Because there is implicit bias in some of the algorithms that's unfair and--and can--I'll--I'll leave it at that. But it was certainly demonstrated that there--there's some unfair issues in the algorithm. So, Dr. Farid can you explain? 
FARID: Yeah. So, there's no question Congressman that simply turning over everything to algorithms that are not explainable or understandable solve all of our problems. As Ms. Collins-Dexter pointed out we have seen bias in algorithms in medical care, in judicial system. So, we do have to be careful about that. And again--you know--we've been beating this drum, but the transparency and the understanding of these algorithms is critical. 
I would say though that --you know--we--we still have this tension here between misalignment of corporate interests and societal interests and what is keeping people on the platform. And that I think is where that tension is. You're--you're absolutely right, Congressman. There is--they have a touch business to run-- 
WALDEN: --Yeah-- 
FARID: --What insults you doesn't insult me and vice versa. 
WALDEN: And I--I--I know my time's about over. But I--I would just say I've seen it too in the news business where they actually (INAUDIBLE) read what story what time in the day. Which headline, which lead gets you most--and I'm not sure that's a good thing either. I realize they got to run their business but--but I'm not sure that only reinforces kind of--it doesn't expand our scope of understanding and information. They just drive us deeper into our own silos. 
And so, I yield back-- 
DOYLE: --Gentleman's time--gentleman's time is expired. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Matsui for five minutes. 
MATSUI: Thank you very much Mr. Chairman and thank you very much for your patience for some of us going back and forth all the time between Rules and E and C. Facebook has announced that it will remove COVID-19 related misinformation that could contribute to imminent physical harm. However, Facebook appears to be adopted a narrow interpretation of imminent physical harm as allowing significant amounts of disinformation to remain in circulation online. 
Dr. Farid, do you believe imminent physical harm should include false information about COVID-19 testing site locations, hours of operation, or documentation required? 
FARID: Thank you Congresswoman. I agree with you. I think Facebook has taken a particularly narrow definition of imminent harm and maybe that was an excusable position three, four months ago. But I think if--it is inexcusable today when we know that even a fraction of the population that is getting misinformation can lead to health problems for the entire society and world. 
So, I think that they need to take a much harder line on this both in terms of what we see publicly and also the private groups that are much less transparent. 
MATSUI: So, do you also believe is there additional public health infor--misinformation you believe should be removed by Facebook? 
FARID: Absolutely. We are seeing a proliferation of misinformation and conspiracies on Facebook, on YouTube, on Twitter, on Reddit, and on almost all social media platforms that are not actively being dealt with. 
MATSUI: Well--you know--even a situation where Facebook has taken down COVID-19 misinformation has failed to adequately remove all posts spreading the same false information. In one instance, Facebook removed a post suggesting that wearing a mask in public can make you sick but failed to remove duplicates or co--clones of this original post. Dr. Farid, in your opinion, has Facebook committed sufficient resources to identify and remove all duplicate or shared posts related to COVID-19 misinformation? 
FARID: They have not. And part of that is excusable because most of their moderators have not been able to do the work from home. And I--I understand that. But the fact is is that prior to COVID-19 they did not have the safeguards in place both in terms of content moderators, in terms of technology, and in terms of policy to deal with these types of issues. 
MATSUI: Okay. Facebook has promoted its groups feature as a way for users to communicate privately with other users about the topic of shared interest. While these groups have allowed some family members or local clubs to foster more intimate interactions, they have also provided malicious actors with a new tool to spread misinformation, hate speech, and conspiracy theories. 
Ms. Collins-Decter--Dexter, how have white nationalism face groups--Facebook groups to spread hate speech and have these groups translated into real world activity? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Absolutely. I--our first entry point into negotiating with Facebook actually came about six years ago when there were closed white nationalist hate groups that were doxing organizers and black people in Sacramento and in store--Stone Mountain, Georgia. And people were showing up to those places and to people's homes with guns. 
And when we went to Facebook and asked them to make changes they said they didn't feel like they had a problem and were slow to move. Now--cut to now, we see this plethora of issues coming out by the day of the ways in which violent hate speech, calls to murder, calls to violence run rampant in closed groups. And including targeting loss in other places. And Facebook again has been slow to act. 
MATSUI: Well do you believe that Facebook provides sufficient public information about the ownership, management, and membership of neo-Confederate or white nationalist groups? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: I think that's actually the same question. We are for sure in favor of privacy, that's why we support laws like the one in California. And I think it's extremely important that we maintain data protection activities. But again, when that line crosses over to bullets dipped in pigs blood--like, calls to action that are actively going to compromise people's lives and safety, we have to really be strident about the ways in which we're making that information public so people can protect themself. 
MATSUI: Okay. I just have a few seconds here. YouTube has had some success limiting the prevalence of misinformation by stressing its recommendation algorithms. Dr. Farid, do you believe YouTube has a capacity to further adjust its algorithms to limit the spread of misinformation? And if so why haven't these adjustments been implemented? I've got like 17 seconds. You have 17 seconds-- 
FARID: --Yes. So, the answer is yes they have the ability. In late 2018 we saw upwards of 10 percent of the recommended videos being conspiratorial and under public pressure they've been able to reduce that to around three percent. They've always had the ability to do it, they simply have not. 
MATSUI: Okay. Well thank you very much. And I thank all the witnesses and I yield back. 
DOYLE: Gentlelady yields back. It's--Chair now recognizes Mr. Kinzinger for five minutes. 
KINZINGER: Well thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you to--to all our witnesses for being here. Very much appreciated. Despite all the debate I actually have yet to really take a position on whether to preserve, amend, or repeal Section 230. Given the potential ramifications I definitely want to just take my time and be thoughtful. 
What makes the most sense is to make other legislative or regulatory attempts to bring about the change we want before we throw the baby out with the bathwater. If those options fail we still have the ability to go back and amend or repeal it later. For example, I've introduced solutions to one subset of these issues, the fake accounts which are under discussion today. 
One of them's HR6586, the Social Media Accountability and Account Verification Act, which was referred to this committee. And also, the second bill, it's HR6587, the Social Media Fraud Mitigation Act which is related but was referred to the juda--Judiciary Committee. 
Taken together the bills seek to protect consumers by improving the operations of social media companies and punishing those who use fake accounts to cause harm to others. My office took on the task of trying to legislate or regulate social media companies without amending Section 230 or trampling on free speech and it was certainly not easy. 
We consulted with attorneys, non-profits, consumer advocates, industry, and more. And yes, we want--we--we went to every or almost nearly ever--every Democrat on the two subcommittees represented here today to ask them to work with me on the bill and--and lead it with me. We offered to work with anyone to improve our language to try to gro--garner broad support. 
To be fair some did engage and provide constructive feedback. And I'm proud to say that much of the feedback was incorporated into the bill. I'm not saying this to be mean spirited, I'm not calling anyone out by name. But as of today, and not for the lack of effort, I still don't have a partner on the other side of the aisle to work with me on it. 
If my friends on the other side of the aisle don't like my bill, there are other ideas offered by my Republican colleagues. That's fine. It won't hurt my feelings. But we've put something out there. And so, let's either work on this together or please put forward a reasonable solution of your own. Because frankly I'm a little frustrated that we keep having the Section 230 conversation and we haven't found a path forward. Or rather, it seems we can't even find an intersection where we're supposed to meet to chart a path forward. 
So I'll end my comments by once again inviting my colleagues on the other side of the aisle or really any of my colleagues--I could use some Republican support as well--to reach out so we can move this ball forward. 
But more broadly, whether we're talking about romance scams, fake profiles, or tools of state craft involved in massive, coordinated disinformation effort we clearly have a problem with the status quo. We've already touched on whether you all think that social media companies are utilizing all of their tools that they can to be able to take down scams or fraudulent activity. And Mr. Walden touched on the incentives for the companies. 
So, I want to follow up on that with Mr. Farid. Putting aside the complexities of algorithm development, what other barriers are there in preventing the companies from implementing these safeguards? 
FARID: I think the primary barriers are technology. We saw that when the platforms wanted to remove adult pornography or--or copyright information they were able to do that. So, it is primarily one of resources being put to research to deal with these issues. But there is real tension here and we have to recognize it. Which is that it is fighting up against the core business model. You're--you're literally asking companies to reduce their profits. 
And look, that's a tough ask. And that's because the core business model is one of engagement and not one of the way, say, Netflix or Spotify or Amazon Prime is where I pay a monthly fee and they get the money no matter what and they just have to grow the user base. So, there's tension here. And I think that tension is at the core of why it is difficult to get the companies to act on these issues. 
KINZINGER: So, is the only real answer then government intervention in your mind? 
FARID: I think there's two interventions. One is--is healthy competition. Maybe it's time for a better business model. Maybe we don't have to have a purely data driven ad driven technology sector. Maybe there's a better business model. Maybe advertisers can say you know what, we don't want our--our ads running al--against hateful, divisive, conspiratorial content. 
And then of course there's us the user. I mean so you could--you could blame the people creating the fake content. You can blame the platform for amplifying it. But we're part of the problem too. We're the ones sharing it, liking it, and re-Tweeting it. So as an educator I also have to say this is our failure that we the people are part of the problem as well. 
And of course, here there has to be sensible regulation. And I agree with you, Congressman, that you don't want to throw out 230 and you don't want to move too fast in this space and have unintended consequences. There's been many, many wonderful things from technology. And we have to think carefully and thoughtfully how modest change can--can help us get out of the mess that we're in today. 
KINZINGER: Well thank you. And I have another question I'll submit for the record and I yield back-- 
DOYLE: --I see the gentleman's time has expired. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Kinzinger. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Castor. You're recognized for five minutes. 
CASTOR: Well thank you Mr. Chairman. Hey, our witnesses have been terrific today so thank you very much all of you. I'd like to ask if--if the liability shield under Section 230 were eliminated today, what practical changes would the tech platforms like Facebook make? What--what would we see happen? I'll start with Ms. Collins-Dexter. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Alright. Could you say that one more time? 
CASTOR: If the--if the liabil--liability shield under Section 230 were eliminated today what practical changes would we see tech platforms like Facebook make? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah--you know--I honestly don't know. And this is part of the reason why I think we need to have this conversation in a broader context, one about general corporate responsibility and corporate (INAUDIBLE). And too, around like understanding what the research is telling us about 230. 
I know that it's time to have a serious conversation around 230 for sure. But in terms of like privacy protections and a number of other factors taking a blow torch to 230 before we've actually had a chance to talk about that is important. And (INAUDIBLE)-- 
OVERTON: --And--and--yeah let me just cut in-- 
COLLINS-DEXTER: --Mr. Overton-- 
OVERTON: --Sure. Let me just chime in for a moment. We really do need 230. And--and we need some form of 230 for a couple reasons. One, we want Black Lives Matter, we want the Tea Party, we want a variety of grassroots organizations to be able to participate and post their material without fear that the--the platforms feel like they're going to be sued. Right? 
So, 230 is important in terms of facilitating the speech of grassroots folks. It's an important provision, right? But like we said, there's some problems and there need to be some tweaks here. It's also important in terms of the original purpose was to facilitate content moderation. This notion that you're not responsible for every single thing that goes up. 
And again, as a result you can have a lot of different voices up. But again, if you are discriminating and using your algorithms to make money to--you know--target employment ads toward whites and away from Latinos-- 
COLLINS-DEXTER: --But it's--it's worse than that. It's worse than that though with the proliferation of child pornography and other illicit behavior. It goes beyond just the--the debate on--beyond our free speech and the first amendment. There is a lot of illicit activity that these tech platforms have used that liability shield to shield themselves. 
OVERTON: That--that--that's absolutely right. And that's why I say hey we should think about reform rather than just I think your initial point was let's just kind of blow it up or--or--you know--what would happen if we repealed it completely. Right? And I--and I do think that there's a problem with just absolute complete repeal not just to the tech companies but to--to average citizens in our democracy. 
FRIED: And I agree. Yeah, I agree but there's some good news here, which is the benefits of 230 come from C2. It comes from the safe harbor for content moderation, right? We wanted--we didn't want Prodigy to be punished for stopping child predators. We didn't want Prodigy punished when it tried and missed something. So, we can keep C2. The problem is C1 which says you don't have to do any of that. 
So, my proposal is let's put that duty of care back in place. Let's keep C2 which keeps the internets and the platforms as an avenue from free expression. But let's tweak C1 so that they actually have to earn that, they actually have to exercise a duty of care to stop the illicit stuff in exchange for that. That gets us the best of both worlds. We stop the illegal activity, but we keep the platform for free expression. 
And Mr. Farid. 
FARID: Thank you. We have a--a--an interesting experiment that has been being played out in Germany over the last few years with the NetzDG law which was addressing hate speech, terrorism, and extremism. And what happened is when the Germans passed very strict laws on take down, what happened is that the companies ramped up their human moderators. And they ended up doing a good job. 
They started--they just said look, now the law mandates this with penalties up to 50 million euros for each failure. And guess what? They ramped up. They started getting better moderators, better technology, and the law actually works. So, we have a good existing proof that we can actually do better. 
CASTOR: Thanks to all of you. I'll yield back. Thanks. 
DOYLE: Thank you, gentlelady yields back. It now gives me pleasure to introduce my friend and fellow suffering Pittsburgh Pirate fan Mr. Bilirakis for five minutes. 
BILIRAKIS: We haven't lost a game yet, Mr. Chairman. 
(LAUGHTER) 
DOYLE: That's because we haven't played yet. 
BILIRAKIS: You're right. And we have a good shot with this short season though. Okay. We'll get back to business. 
I want to thank the witnesses. Mr. Fried, as both Representative McKinley and I have passionately called on in past hearings, we have seen advertisements for the sale of illegal drugs on social media websites. As we know there are two types of ad groups online. One a private negotiation between the platform and the advisor. The other where the advisor is the winner of a bid war for immediate available ad space where the platform is less connected to the transaction. 
And this is the question. How if at all can Section 230 be retrofitted to fairly provide platform accountability for advertisements of illegal products in both these circumstances, or is there another method to address this very serious problem-- 
FRIED: --And I think-- 
BILIRAKIS: --Question for Mr. Fried. 
FRIED: Sure, thank you Congressman. I think if we fix 230 C1 and recreate the duty of care we will make a lot of progress. Right--because then there actually is an incentive to solve the problem. There's--there's a legal consequence for failing to. If a nightclub doesn't do enough to stop the peddling of drugs in its nightclub, it can be culpable. But in the same scenario a platform cannot because of C1. 
So, I think we need to recreate that duty of care. And this applies to all the (INAUDIBLE) that we see on the internet, whether it's illicit drugs, peddling of child pornography, cybercrime, fraud. There is a lack of a legal incentive that applies to everybody else who's not an online platform, whether they're traditional media or even just brick and mortar retail. And we need to right those incentives. 
We can save C2 so we get the free expression. But if we recreate that duty of care just to require reasonable action and let there be scrutiny--right now we don't have to take the word of everybody else. But we have to take the word of the platforms. They may be doing a good job. In fact, often they are. But there's no scrutiny at that. And that's why we need to fix the incentive. 
BILIRAKIS: Thank you. My next question again for Mr. Fried. Section 230 C2 as you mention in your written testimony and then also here states that a--a provider is protected from liability for any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene or otherwise objectionable. And that's a quote here. 
That is an exceptionally wide protection. What is your opinion--in your opinion what would be required for a provider to fail that standard under the current language and--and are you aware of any real world solutions where the standard was not met? Again for Mr. Fried. 
FRIED: Sorry, I'm having a little mic trouble. Can you hear me? 
BILIRAKIS: Yes, I can. 
FRIED: So, when we're talking about speech we do have to be a little more concerned as Mr. Walden pointed out about the first amendment. But there may be some value in the good faith provision, right? So, it gets clear--right--the--Section 230 is meant to protect consumers, right? So, an effort to protect consumers done in good faith is fine. But if there's evidence--and it would take evidence--but if there is evidence that there's a pretextual use of content moderation it's not really to help consumers but that's being used as a pretext for some other motive, then you might have a court say well okay, 230 doesn't apply. 
There are starting to be some discussion of that. It's not always a clear discussion of good faith. But I'd look for a discussion of that. What--what is pretextual rather than protecting consumers? That may be a place to explore. That way you don't have to worry about regulating speech. Like it's clear that that--there was evidence that's not what they're doing is protecting consumers. Then maybe they don't get the defense of 230. 
Now that doesn't mean that they are necessarily culpable for anything. It just means they've lost their liability shield. They still would--would have had to engage in something illicit. But at least you can have that conversation. Have they done something, have they violated a contract, have they violated a law without using 230 as a--a shield when they're not really protecting a consumer? 
BILIRAKIS: Alright. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman I'll yield back my 35 seconds. Appreciate it very much. Thank the witnesses as well. 
DOYLE: I thank the gentleman. It gives me now pleasure to introduce the gentleman from the great state of California, Mr. McNerney for five minutes. 
MCNERNEY: I thank the chairs and the ranking members and the panelists. This is a great hearing and great engagements on both sides of the aisle, so thank you all. Last year I sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg expressing concerns about the potential conflict of interest that Facebook faces between their bottom line and addressing the spread of political disinformation on their platform. 
I asked specific questions focusing on Facebook's handling of disinformation. But they did not answer my questions. I also asked Facebook some of these questions again when they testified before the committee earlier this year. Still they refused to answer my questions. 
Professor Farid, you spent a lot of time looking into these issues and working with communities to understand--with the companies to understand their practices. What is it that they are hiding? 
FARID: Mark Zuckerberg is hiding the fact that he knows that hate, lies, and divisiveness are good for business. He's hiding the fact that content moderation is bad for business. And so, he props up these phony arguments to hide behind. And I think Mark Zuckerberg is hiding the fact that his entire business model of maximizing engagement to maximize advertising dollars just stinks. It's bad for us an individual, it's bad for society, and it's bad for democracy. But it's awfully good for his bottom line to the tune of $70 billion last year. 
I continue to argue that the core business model is the poison here. When you are in the attention grabbing ad driven business, your job is to keep people on the platform for as long as possible. And we know that hate, divisiveness, outrageous and conspiratorial--drives business. And he knows this, and he is profiting off of the back is--of us as individuals, society, and democracies. And I think we should hold him accountable for that. 
MCNERNEY: Thank you. That was a pretty strong statement Professor. I appreciate it. Spencer Overton, thank you for presenting this morning. Some Republicans in Washington have made demonstrably false allegations of anti-conservative bias on social media. But as the Representative from Stockton, California, the most racially diverse city in the country, my concern is really about protecting the rights of all citizens to vote. 
Professor, can you talk about some of the tactics that have been used to suppress votes of black people and people of color on social media platforms? Also, with just 131 days to go before the general election, what tactics are you concerned about that will be used leading up to the November election? 
OVERTON: Yes, thank you very much. And just to be clear, I don't think that we can equate content moderation which is debatable with voter suppression. I think that they're just very different things. So, it's a kind of have some false neutrality like they're the same thing is--is--is--is wrong. 
This targeting--targeting of messages at particular communities is a primary device. So, we see that--we saw that in 2016. We're seeing it in 2020. Certainly, messages about--you know--extensive fraud can certainly discourage people from participating and engaging. Or messages that hey we're going to have law enforcement at every polling place. A variety of messages like that can certainly discourage participation especially when they are targeted at a particular community. 
MCNERNEY: Well thank you. I--Professor Farid has already addressed the question of what action the platforms could be taking and talked about the need for advertisers to act. I'd like to hear from the other witnesses starting with Ms. Collins-Dexter. What are some of the steps that social media platforms could be taking right now that they are currently--that they aren't taking to combat the spread of disinformation on their platforms? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Thank you. So, I think there's a lot to be said around the recommendations that folks have mentioned. Often when you're recommending other sources it can take you down a dark rabbit hole. And we've seen that a couple of times with increased recommendations of white supremacists. I think there needs to be (INAUDIBLE) around the content moderation. I think we need permanent civil rights infrastructure that exists in the executive level in the C-Suite working with Mark Zuckerberg. 
I think it's critically important that we see civil rights not as a partisan issue but one that has implications across the board and that there's someone there that represents those interests. 
MCNERNEY: Well thank you. Professor Overton in 30--in 17 seconds. 
OVERTON: Yes. Civil rights, it's not partisan. It's a bipartisan issue. Facebook has kind of created this false dichotomy of like conservatives versus civil rights. That's completely wrong. People in both parties are committed to civil rights and--you know--we need to stay firm with that. 
MCNERNEY: Thank you. I ran out of time, Mr. Chairman. 
DOYLE: The gentleman's time is expired. I thank the gentleman. I see my good friend Mr. Johnson appears to be in an automobile hopefully in the passenger seat. So, Bill, why you're recognized for five minutes. And keep your eyes on the road if you're not in that passenger seat. 
JOHNSON: I--I'm an IT guy Mr. Chairman and I can multitask so I'm--I'm good. 
DOYLE: Okay. 
JOHNSON: But--but I am in the passenger seat. Thank you very much. You know, it--it frustrates me when I hear these--these tech companies like Facebook and Google and Twitter and others hide behind the excuse that it's their algorithms that are making these decisions about the content that they--that they serve up to the American people. 
Look, I--I--I've got two degrees in computer science. We've talked about this before in other hearings. Algorithms are logic constructs that are built by humans and the computers are--are told what to do. They don't dream this stuff up on their own. And--and I also get frustrated because--you know--one of the main reasons that these technology platforms have been able to be as prolific and as powerful as they are is because they haven't been regulated. And--and in the absence of regulation it takes the--the--the notion of social responsibility even that much higher to self-police. 
So, Mr. Fried, in your testimony you talk about how the tech industry is one of the only sectors that not only is free from regulation before the fact, but they're also free from judicial scrutiny after the fact. Instead Congress has delegated the oversight authority to these tech companies--to the actual tech companies themselves to be--to--to self-regulate. How has this balance been struck in other related industries like the newspaper or broadcast industries? And what has been the effect of that balance? 
FRIED: You know--ordinarily it's one or the other. If you're regulated, ordinarily you might have some limited immunity for the regulated activity. Because your business model has been restricted. If you're not regulated than ordinarily you're held culpable if you make a bad decision in designing your business model. The platforms have the best of both worlds. 
Now the traditional media--right--still have a duty of care. In the New York Times versus Sullivan case for example--right--the Supreme Court very importantly said there are first amendment protections in holding a--a media defendant liable when there's a public official who's bringing a libel suit. But even in that case they are subject to a--a knowledge or reckless disregard standard. 
So, if they don't do their due diligence and are reckless or have knowledge of falsity they can still be held culpable under a standard of care. They put a lot of effort into their fact checking to avoid that sort of culpability. And of course, if it's not a public figure there's even more potential culpability because it's not that high of a standard. 
But in--in a case where a platform knowingly or is recklessly disregarding falsity they still can't be held culpable. And that gives them an advantage because they just--they can avoid the ordinary costs of business in--in avoiding harm. 
JOHNSON: Well I think I've lost my sound. Mr. Chairman I'll yield back the remainder of my time. I apologize. I don't know why but I can't--I can't hear anything-- 
DOYLE: --You know what we can hear you Mr--we can hear you Mr. Johnson-- 
JOHNSON: --Can you hear me-- 
DOYLE: --And you still have a minute and 25 seconds. 
JOHNSON: Okay. Well here--here goes my--my last question then. You know--and--and I appreciate what Mr. Fried just said. We--we've seen instances where 
(AUDIO GAP) 
--beyond the--the platforms for third party information distribution to instead acting as content providers. And I agree with Mr. Fried. You can't (INAUDIBLE). 
So, Mr. Fried, as edge platforms make this move from neutral bulletin boards of the 1990s to play (INAUDIBLE) content, has Section 230 given these platforms a leg up--an advantage among their media industry competitors? 
FRIED: I think so. They--they don't have to be as sensitive to misinformation, to defamation. They avoid cost that every other responsible media organization has to be very concerned about, right? They're pushing data. They're not worried as much about curating content. And that gives them an advantage. 
JOHNSON: Yeah. I--I agree with you totally. Mr. Chairman, in spite of my technical malfunction I'll yield back a total 15 seconds. Thank you. 
DOYLE: Okay. I thank the gentleman. Now it gives me pleasure to introduce Vermont's most popular Congressman, Peter Welch. Mr. Welch you're recognized for five minutes. 
WELCH: Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to start out with a reference to--to my colleagues Mr. Kinzinger and Mr. Johnson and what he just said. Mr. Kinzinger asked the question as to whether it is time to pull the plug and to say that Congress has to act on Section 230. And that would be Congress making decisions about what a duty of care is (AUDIO GAP) to provide 
(AUDIO GAP) 
--of the various platforms. Ms. Collins-Deck--Dexter, just very briefly. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah, I--if I understand you I think you're saying more regul--whether or not we should do regulations? Sorry, you cut out. 
WELCH: Law--law and regulation. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yes. We absolutely need it. I think it's important-- 
WELCH: --And I just want to go through this really quickly. So, and Mr--Mr. Farid. 
FARID: Absolutely. We've been waiting for years, Congressman, for the tech industry to self-regulate and they haven't. So, we have to make some changes. 
WELCH: Okay. And Mr. Fried. 
FRIED: Don't eliminate 230 but fix it. 
WELCH: Okay. And Professor Overton. 
OVERTON: Yes. We need some changes. 
WELCH: And I'm--I'm going to characterize something that I think is--is what I'm seeing that if the situation--you have a--a case like the typical defense from the tech companies about inter--quote interfering as they put it with Section 230. Is it 230 they cite in this committee years ago was the author of Section 230. Has made us the biggest internet success in the world. 
Now Mr. Zuckerber--Zuckerberg's argument is essentially--so--look how rich I am. That's how successful Section 230 is. But the casualty more and more is democratic discussion and democratic debate. And this is where I want to go to Mr. Johnson. 
The Zuckerberg defense is that he doesn't want to monitor speech but as a number of you have said and Mr. Johnson pointed out, the algorithm is something they control, number one. And number two is Professor Overton pointed out it's not about speech. It's about peddling the--the--the--the conflicting content that will most--get the most hits and produce the most money. 
Can each of you comment as to whether you see that as an ongoing threat to our democratic debate and dialogue? And I'll start--I'll start with you Mr. Fried. 
FRIED: Was that Fried or Farid? If it's Fried, I would say fix the incentives-- 
WELCH: --We'll go with you if you're up-- 
FRIED: --And the rest will fix it-- 
WELCH: --Pardon me? 
FRIED: I'd say fix the incentives and the rest will fix itself. We don't need to regulate them, we just need to give them the same incentive everybody else has to moderate their content, protect consumers, and know that if they're reckless they're going to be culpable. 
WELCH: Alright. Mr. Farid. 
FARID: You're absolutely right, Congressman. We--they control the algorithms. They have designed the algorithms to promote the hate and the divisive and the conspiratorial and they--they can optimize it differently. They just need the right incentives whether that's regulatory, advertising, or competition. 
WELCH: And let me--do--go to Professor Overton. The question I think many of us have and my colleague John Sarbanes has raised this before. Can Section 230 freedom for these platforms to do anything they want where the algorithms about intensified division coexist with decent democratic debate or does one have to become the casualty of the other? 
OVERTON: Well so far one has become the casualty of the other. And part of the problem there is that the platforms have not taken the steps they need to protect civil rights. They have the authority. They have the power. They haven't used it effectively. They haven't responded here. So that is the problem. And in light of that--you know--I--I do believe that that status quo is untenable. 
WELCH: Alright. Thank you very much for this excellent hearing. I yield back Mr. Chairman. 
DOYLE: Okay. Thank the gentleman for yielding back. Let's see now who's next. Chair recognizes Mr. Flores for five minutes. 
FLORES: Thank you Mr. Chairman and I thank you for hosting this hearing. Mr. Fried I thank you for appearing here today and for your thoughtful testimony. And particularly--in particular I appreciate your sensitivity to preserving First Amendment rights in the context of suggesting practical and effective solutions to the spread of disinformation. 
As you su--succinctly observed earlier Section 230 was created to quote, ""One, help a nascent online industry to develop into a forum for user generated content and two, to stem the growing spate of harmful behavior on the internet"" unquote. As I think we can all agree it succeeded beyond all expectations on the first goal to grow the industry but has fallen woefully short of stem--stemming harmful behavior from the second part. 
You've recommended recalibrating Section 230 to restore a duty of care by requiring internet platforms to take reasonable, good faith steps to prevent illicit use of their services as a condition of receiving Section 230's protection. In other words, holding the platforms accountable when they act with negligent reckless or woeful disregard. 
Can you elaborate on what restoring a duty of care looks like in practice and how that becomes operational? In other words, what is the dynamic that makes this approach successful? 
FRIED: So, it's all about incentives. I think a number of the witnesses have talked about it. Every other non-platform has a duty, right? If they let their facilities be used to harm another and don't take reasonable steps, they can be held accountable. That's really what we want. No one can question them right now when they say we've done enough. We're being reasonable. 
And again, in many cases they may be, and they'll be vindicated when they are. But when they're--when they're not and you can't question it victims are left with no remedy. Often they can't even get discovery because as soon as the court says oh, sorry, it's--you know--a content moderation issue you can't even question whether the platforms are being responsible. Are they being reckless? Are they willful disregard of a lot of awful stuff happening on their platform? 
If you create that duty of care you solve that problem, but you keep the great stuff that has made the platform so big. It's the--it's the content moderation safe harbor to promote free expression. That's the good part. That's what I think everyone wanted to do--that's what Congress wanted to do to address the Prodigy case. To help the good actor, the good Samaritan. Unfortunately, C1 protects the bad Samaritan. 
FLORES: Let's dig a little bit further out of this. How do we determine what will constitute a reasonable good faith step to predict--to prevent illicit use? And can you provide an example of a model to illustrate? That would be very helpful. 
FRIED: Sure. The--the reasonableness is not hard. That's a standard everybody lives on if you're not under--if you're not a platform right? And so, if you're acting negli--negligently or recklessly you can be held accountable. We don't really have to define that. There's plenty of precedent on that. 
The--the (INAUDIBLE) faith is a little bit more of a challenge. But again, I think that the key there--and again we have to be careful because that--the good faith provision tends to come up more in a speech context than a--a illicit activity context. But are they really trying to moderate to protect consumers or is it a pretext? Are they using the claim of content moderation not to protect consumers but to accomplish some other objective? 
If there is evidence of that then you can actually say okay let's strip away the protection of 230 because this is not about protecting consumers, this is not being done in good faith. Then you have to ask the second question which is have they really done something illicit? They may not have. If it's a pure speech issue even if they don't get protection of 230, the first amendment protects them. It's have they violated some other duty. Once you get rid of the 230 protection then you can ask that question. 
Many times, they won't have violated a duty. Unfortunately, there are cases where I think they are violating that duty. That's the incentive we need to fix. 
FLORES: Okay. Well it's great to have you join us for the committee again today and I yield back the balance of my time. 
FRIED: Thank you. 
DOYLE: Okay, thank you Mr. Flores. He yields back. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California Mr. Cardenas for five minutes. You need to unmute, Tony. 
CARDENAS: Okay, got it. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. Appreciate this opportunity. And Ranking Member--Chairman and Ranking Members to and women to have this important hearing. The issues that come to mind for me for Americans is that we have a lot of major problems going on today. And Americans don't know who to believe or where to get their information and what to believe. 
So, people are confused about what's news and what's commentary. The leaders of this nation have had an inherent level of credibility in the hearts and minds of Americans for--for generations. And that's a good thing. We have a--a big problem when we have a President who is misusing his access to the loudest megaphones in the land. And by virtue of the megaphone and his affinity for making false claims in--in the biggest transmitter of information and disinformation has become. 
According to one database as of April third, 2020 President Trump has made 18,000 false or misleading claims during his time in office. Even if they only have that half right, you're still approaching 10,000 times of the most powerful person in the world giving misleading or misinformation. We all know a few of the most recent claims, the use of Hydroxychloroquine to cure the Coronavirus which the FDA has now said not to use because it--because the medicine has failed in several clinical trials. 
Or the constant rhetoric of the Hispanic Invasion. He has used this word at least two dozen times when referring to Latinos and Latina immigrants or asylum seekers. Even after a shooter killed 20 people in El Paso last fall and referenced the Hispanic Invasion, Trump warned yet again of a looming invasion and claimed without any evidence whatsoever that a caravan of migrants headed to the border had been infiltrated by gang members. 
A--he even sent U.S. troops to the border, insisting that the operation was necessary to keep our country safe. But after the election was over there wasn't an--another peep about an invasion and our troops were quietly called back. When the public reacts in horror to what he Tweets, sometimes he and his staff walk things back and say he was just kidding. Well of course the American people are confused. More than just confusing disinformation and misinformation are harmful to--the things that are harmful to the people of this great nation when they come from a supposed leader and can have even more dangerous consequences for marginalized communities. 
Ms. Collins-Dexter, in your testimony you mentioned disinformation campaigns that have used social media to inflame racial divisions and hostilities in America. And we all know the President loves to use inflammatory rhetoric however inaccurate sew--to sew hate and discord between Americans. 
Can you explain the long term and short term consequences and impacts of disinformation and misinformation that come from the President on disenfranchised and underrepresented populations? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Thank you. Thank you Congressman. There's a--there's a number of different issues here. There's one that's safety of people offline. We've seen an increase of white nationalist hate crimes carried out against (INAUDIBLE) groups Latinx, Asian, Black communities, Muslim communities, and part of that's (INAUDIBLE) small groups. 
Also, voter suppression as Dr. Overton has talked about. We've seen a lot of that. It's been--we've talked extensively about Black attacks. It's actually been woefully underreported how much disinformation around voting has been targeted to Latinx communities and actually was targeted through the resident troll farms. And so, there's a number of ways in which you can see fractures in our democracy and ability to live that come from disinformation online being unregulated by figures--particularly those that are validated with blue checks by their name. 
CARDENAS: Than--thank you. And--and to some of our panelists if you could explain Section 230. Being that some of these platforms are now the largest corporations in America, apparently having revenues in the tune of tens of billions of dollars a year are they adhering to 230 correctly when it comes to the possibility of interfering with their revenue? 
In other words, do they have enough resources to be more technology adherent and also hire more individuals so that they can actually do their due diligence and adhere to the spirit of 230 while still having--giving themselves the opportunity to continue their business model? 
Okay. No panelists have an opinion about whether or not it's a shortage of resources for companies like Facebook and others? Okay, alright. Well-- 
FARID: --I'll chime in, Congressman. I don't think it's a shortage of resources. When Facebook makes $70 billion a year, this is not a resource problem. This is a priority problem-- 
CARDENAS: --Thank you. Thank you very much. 
DOYLE: Gentleman's time has expired. 
CARDENAS: Okay. Thank you so much. I yield back. 
DOYLE: Thank you. Chair now recognizes Ms. Brooks for five minutes. 
BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you so much for this incredibly important hearing. I want to talk about the practical aspects. When we had Mark Zuckerberg testify before our committee, now a couple of years ago, I actually asked him the question about promulgation of terrorist messaging. I had a constituent who actually had been beheaded by ISIS. I asked--I'm a former U.S. attorney and prosecuted many child exploitation cases and talked about still the proliferation of child exploitation over the internet. And he talked about the number of content moderators that the company had hired, that they were hiring more. 
Dr. Farid, I'd like you to talk a little bit about the--the practical aspects of how content moderators work. And I believe Dr. Collins-Dexter, you might have mentioned that content moderators are often not in this country. I was not aware of this. Both of you quickly talk about how the--how the platforms actually use content moderators. And then, also I've recently heard that they sued these platforms because of really horrific kind of--the type of work that they do. 
FARID: Yeah. 
BROOKS: So, I'm very concerned about this. 
FARID: I think you're right to be concerned, Congresswoman. So, first of all, most of the moderators, the vast majority, are not employees of Facebook. They are third party. They go through vendors. There have been horrific stories of their misuse. They're underpaid. They're overworked. They have PTSD within weeks of working because they are looking at the absolutely worst and horrific content that you can't even imagine online, and they are not given the mental health issues or the resources to deal with it. 
Facebook has outsourced some of the ugliest work that they have to do, and I think that they should be ashamed of themselves for that. The fact that they don't have enough moderators--they're very happy to trot out the number of moderators. But, the reality is that these moderators are spending fractions of a second looking at a piece of content and having to look at that for eight, ten hours straight day after day after day. These are horrific working conditions, and that's why some of the really good investigative journalism called out these companies for horrific treatment of this. 
I can tell you, having worked in the child sexual exploitation space, that when the National Center for Missing Exploited Children, or the Canadian Center for Child Protection does content moderation, they limit--greatly limit to only a few hours a day of what moderators will see. They have mental health issues. They have breaks. They take care of the people who are doing the dirty ugly work. And Facebook is simply not doing that. 
BROOKS: Thank you. And I must say that because I was a prosecutor in these types of cases, I--I did witness some of this. And it is horrific. And so, thank you for your--but--but, what--we have to have content moderators. And is your suggestion that through either more reporting, more transparency, that the country, the world understand what is being allowed on these platforms? 
FARID: What--what we should be moving to, first of all, is not doubling but quadrupling tenth factor moderators so they can spend less and less time looking at this material to sort of minimize the harm. And, at the same time, we should be deploying technology to mitigate the content that human moderators have to look at. The goal should be--you're always going to need human moderators to make the difficult calls. But, technology can do better and better this. We've seen that success from the child sexual exploitation space. But, it's simply, again, an issue of investment. 
So, we have to--we need way more moderators than we have. We have to treat them better. They have to have mental health issues. And we need to start deploying technology in a much more effective way to minimize the harm to the human moderators. 
BROOKS: Thank you. I'm going to shift very briefly. Dr. Collins-Dexter, you mentioned in your opening statement about the office of--Congress's OTA. Can you--I'm on the bipartisan committee on modernization of Congress, and we have talked about renewing Congress's--in the House, the office of technology assessment, I believe, or--can--can you talk about what role you believe that would play or you think in--in order to help us move forward in these very difficult understanding of this type of problem? What--what was your recommendation there? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah. So, I mean--two more things on content moderation. A, when we first went to Facebook five years ago and told them about the hate speech and violent (INAUDIBLE) online, they told us that their content moderators didn't understand how racism looked in the U.S., and that's why there were false positives. So, that's an issue. Also, they've cut back a lot, which in a time of coronavirus is a big deal. 
Shoutout to my mother in law who worked at the Library of Congress and was a part of this. And she did a lot of like bipartisan research around technology. And one of the things they said is that when they took the partisanship out of the research, they were actually able to do a lot and invest in like innovation and communities. 
BROOKS: Thank you. 
DOYLE: Gentlelady's time has expired. Chair now recognizes Congresswoman Kelly for five minutes. 
KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to all that are testifying today. As we established, many people, especially young people, use social media as their primary source of obtaining news and also, as we've established, unfortunately through COVID and recent protests, there's been a lot of misinformation and disinformation. 
Mr. Collins-Dexter and Mr. Overton, social media platforms have used a variety of approaches to reduce disinformation on their platforms, removing or down--breaking this information that doesn't pass fact checking by independent organizations, upranking and featuring authoritative content from recognized health authorities, changing the user experience designed to introduce friction and being more transparent about the use of machine learning to moderate content. 
Should they be using these approaches on other topics that create similar harm such as the census, political protests, or voting? And what other approaches should they be using now? Either one of you can start. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Professor Overton, do you want to start? 
OVERTON: Sure, thanks so much. Certainly, when we look at--I know that they have fallen short, in some ways, with COVID here. And Dr. Farid--I defer to him. But, I would also just say they have been doing a better job with COVID-19 than they have with regard to voting rights. So, I would agree with you that they need to, you know--they do a good job on obscenity. 
They do a good job on some others. They need to adapt some of these practices. Some of it is technology and investing in technology. Some of it is changing definitions about what needs to be moderated in terms of voter suppression, in terms of misrepresentations about long lines, et cetera. That stuff needs to be included as well from a policy standpoint. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah. I agree--sorry (INAUDIBLE). 
KELLY: No, go on. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Yeah. I absolutely agree. I think we have been asking them for years to make certain changes, and it is mind boggling how quickly they were able to scale up in the--a couple weeks into--when this information was exploding online. Unfortunately, it was a little bit late because there was a lot of black disinformation that we've been tracking--I'll be releasing a report later this week--around how much had traveled before they cracked down. 
But, I think what we see time and time again is that the urgency that they feel around other issues does not apply when we're talking about white nationalism or--or things--anti-black disinformation. 
KELLY: Thank you. Professor Farid, in your testimony, you mentioned how video recommendation algorithms can accelerate disinformation and create a feedback loop. What incentive is there for social media companies to stop their current practices if it's generating more eyeballs and more ad revenue? And how should companies intervene, and is there a specific approach you believe platforms should take for viral content review? 
FARID: Right. So, the first thing to understand is that, on YouTube, for example, 70 percent, seven, zero, of watched videos are those that are recommended by YouTube, not just organically you clicking on a video. So, they are controlling what we see to a significant extent, number one. 
Number two, when, for example, YouTube was called out over and over again for not protecting children online, Disney withheld advertising dollars, and then, YouTube made changes. Similarly, when they started getting called out for horrific dangerous and deadly conspiracies, they eventually made changes. 
So, the--so, there--there--there are real hard technological problems here. There are difficult content moderation problems. We have not even come close to that line yet. The issue is, as we've been talking about--is just a misalignment of incentives. So, they profit with eyeballs. Conspiratorial, hateful, and decisiveness maximizes eyeballs. So, unless there is a regulatory oversight, an advertising boycott, or better platforms emerge, their incentives are not there. And so, we have to sort of give them those incentives. 
KELLY: Okay. And then, how should companies intervene, and is there a specific approach you believe platforms should take for viral content review? 
FARID: Absolutely. So, when content--and you're starting to see this--goes viral, there needs to be human or algorithmic moderation. If something has two views, I'm not worried about it right now. But, when those things spike--and they know when they spike because the recommendation algorithms find them and start promoting them--they have to have extra scrutiny. And that just needs putting the resources to that. 
KELLY: Thank you so-- 
FARID: --Let me--let me just--I'm going to emphasize one more thing too (INAUDIBLE). You have to understand that, on social media, the half-life of a post is measured in hours. So, this is not something you can come to a week later or a month later. You have literally minutes to deal with these things as they go viral because they happen very, very fast-- 
KELLY: --Thank you so much. Thank you to all the witnesses. And I yield back, Mr. Chair. 
DOYLE: Thank you. Gentlelady yields back. The chair now recognizes Mr. Hudson for five minutes. 
HUDSON: Thank you, Chairman Doyle, Ranking Member Latta, Chairwoman Schakowsky, and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers. Thank you for holding this joint hearing today. And thank you to all our witnesses for--for what's been an excellent discussion. 
The United States is a country founded on the principle of free speech and free exchange of ideas as one of the principles that truly makes our nation great. However, I'm disturbed by a recent trend of political censorship and liberal bias that has consumed social media platforms. Just yesterday, as has been mentioned earlier, Twitter took it upon themselves to censor another one of President Trump's tweets that posed the establishment of an autonomous zone of Washington D.C. similar to the one that we see in Seattle. 
This divisiveness we are discussing here today is really. Companies are openly suggested they support the free expression of ideas so long as they are the same as their own. This does nothing but undermine free speech and divide our nation. As we examine how online disinformation further exacerbates these issues and further divides our nation, we must realize the far-reaching consequence of our actions and policy proposals. 
To be clear, deliberately misleading anyone about medical treatments or sharing false information about the COVID-19 virus is dangerous and wrong. Spreading hate speech or disparaging others based on their race is also dangerous, and it is wrong. 
On the other hand, when we discuss reforms to the internet, we must be deliberate. We cannot stifle the innovation which has given us the greatest tool the world has ever seen. Without the internet and social media, our spread of critical information related to COVID-19 would have been slowed and could have cost thousands of lives. 
Additionally, it was a social media post that first told the world about the death of George Floyd. And the protest and demonstrations that have followed take advantage of things like hashtags, Facebook groups, and livestreaming to share with the world their message in a way that was not possible just a few years ago. 
Mr. Fried, a lot of the testimony we heard is focused on reforms to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In your testimony, you lay out several reforms that you'd like to see in order to restore the original intent of the law while protecting free expression. If Congress does go too far in your opinion regulating the internet, what are some of the risks we're taking? Would we be able to have the same sort of dialogues and civic engagement that we've come to enjoy on our social media platforms? 
FRIED: So, the good news is--is I'm not proposing regulation. Right? Regulation is usually limiting a business model in advance, saying, ""You can't use your discretion."" That's not the proposal on the table. Right? What we're talking about is applying a duty of care. You have all the discretion you want in the front end. All we're saying is that if you make a bad decision, then you can be held culpable, like every other business in America. 
I think that avoids the harm of regulation. We don't want to stifle innovation. We don't have to. Let them innovate. But, if they innovate wrong, if they are careless and reckless, like every other business in America, they should be able to be held to account. If they're doing nothing wrong--and they often aren't--everything's fine. But, when they are, we can't even question it (INAUDIBLE). Let's take the regulation off the table. I don't think we're going to chill innovation by holding them to the same duty of care as everybody else. 
We do have to be careful on speech. And so, I think there--we've got to be very careful. It's a lot easier than (INAUDIBLE) illicit conduct. Maybe there's some room in the good faith requirement. If the courts give some meaning to that in a careful way about pretext, I think that can go a long way in solving some of our speech concerns. 
HUDSON: That--that makes sense to me. And, you know, Mr. Flores asked you about some of your ideas under your ""reasonable good faith steps."" What--what--but--but, my question, I guess, would be--how would that be enforced? What would that look like? 
FRIED: I'm sorry, again. Was that Fried or Farid? Is that for me? 
HUDSON: That's for you. Yes, sir. 
FRIED: Again. So, every other company in America--right--is subject to a duty of care. They deal with it every day, and so, they take reasonable steps. This would largely be self-enforcing. We'd be lining up incentives. If they're going to be reckless--right--if they're going to allow--they're not going to combat the distribution of drugs over their platforms, they're not going to do what every other business does to make sure their facilities aren't misused, they'll be held accountable. I don't think there's a lot to do other than recreate the duty of care that applies to everybody else. 
HUDSON: Thank you for that. And I--I'm running low on time. But, Ms. Collins-Dexter, I want to ask you quickly--throughout your career, you've worked on many successful campaigns and initiatives. Could you share with us how social media has been utilized as a tool for your efforts as well as for some current projects? How do you think various movements that seek to change society have benefitted from (INAUDIBLE) individuals' ability to participate through social media? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Groups have always benefited from new technologies. It's extremely important, as an opportunity for the voices of the unheard to be heard, whether it's through books, whether it's through media, whether it's through technology. And we've seen, when left in the hands of corporations and it becomes unregulated, that actually those voices end up being drowned out more and more. And so, that is part of what we're seeing now in social media. Like as we have not been regulating these companies, more and more this idea of what free speech looks like is operating on a sliding scale where it's free for some and costly for others. 
HUDSON: (INAUDIBLE) 
DOYLE: Gentleman's time has expired. 
HUDSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
DOYLE: I thank the gentleman. Chair now recognizes my good friend Ms. Dingell, for five minutes. 
DINGELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Chairwoman Schakowsky, for holding this important hearing. And the good news for all witnesses that, by the time you get to me, it means you're getting close to the end. 
(LAUGHTER) 
But, this subject--this is something that's very important to me. And I want to say to my colleague, Mr. Hudson, it's not just the conservatives. The unions have, in the last couple of weeks, sent a letter. Facebook's taken down the use of the word ""unionization,"" which has been very disturbing with the UAW because it--it was being taken down from sites where some really specific issues were being discussed. So, I want my colleagues to know it's really an issue on both sides. How do we talk about it, and how do we define it? 
And I am worried about how disinformation spreads like wildfire. And I'm trying to figure out--how do we address it? How do we protect that free speech? But--so, for instance, I've been to many protests over the last two weeks. I don't look at someone who would have been at 17 of them. But, I have. And I have had several people come up to me. I had a constituent who--who was suspended from Facebook for a week for saying that people were going to die because they weren't wearing masks. 
And yet, somebody else, who had been at that vigil, had threatened with guns. She was suspended for a week, and Facebook did not take down the, ""I have guns. I can protect."" There's an inconsistency here that just makes--it--it--there's no--you have no metrics by which to judge who they're making decisions, and I would really beg to differ with that. 
But, let me start with Ms. Collins-Dexter. Have you seen other examples of platforms not applying their terms of services in uniform fashion, and have you seen an uptick in these kind of disparities in recent months? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Absolutely. I think, to be clear, all of the platforms have demonstrated some level of issue with applying the rules unevenly, particularly when it comes to more prominent figures. 
DINGELL: Mr. Farid, I can see you nodding your head too, sir. 
FARID: Yeah. I mean, look, it's easy to pick on Facebook. They're the biggest. But, all the services, from Reddit to Tiktok to YouTube to Google to--to Twitter--they're all struggling under the weight. But, it's their weight. They build these things at scale and at a speed without putting the proper safeguards in place. So, they don't then get to turn around and say, ""Well, the internet's really big. The problems are really hard."" You built this mess, and now you have to fix it. 
OVERTON: And--and Congresswoman--I'm sorry. Congresswoman, Spencer Overton-- 
DINGELL: --Yeah, thank you 
OVERTON: You know, it's definitely debatable about content and what should be regulated, definite, by--by the platforms. The issue though is that these are private entities, and so, for example, when the president talks about free speech, you know, free speech is really about government. Right? 
And so, if we were to basically say Facebook were to have everything, they couldn't remove threats, harassment, altered video, misinformation, sexual privacy invasion, et cetera--so, we definitely want transparency and more consistent content moderation. But, I do think that us simply saying, ""Hey, all of this is free speech,"" opens the door to a lot of negative hate speech and a lot of, you know, violations of basic civil rights here that, you know, we don't want to occur. 
DINGELL: I agree with you, and I really want--I have one--I have another question I want to ask, and I'm running out of time. But, I really fear that the internet has become a tool of fear and hatred. And whenever I talk about the second amendment, the death threats that I get that aren't taken down are sort of stunning. 
But, Mr. Farid--I'm running out of town. Arizona has seen a spike in daily COVID cases. At the beginning of this month, there were roughly 200 new cases per day. Today, that number is over 3,500 daily new cases. Yesterday, President Trump held an event in Phoenix, which is a new COVID hotspot. Thousands of people attended the event without wearing masks and without socially distancing. When asked why they weren't taking the precautions, they told reporters that they didn't believe the number of reported deaths, that they were overstated, and they didn't believe in the severity of the disease. 
Given your research, what do you make of these statements? And do you believe that online platforms are doing enough to curtail the deadly misinformation? 
FARID: So, first of all, I don't think they're doing enough. And we've seen this. We've seen the misinformation apocalypse, and we've seen it propagate down to where people are making decisions that are affecting their health and their neighbor's health and--and those in this country. And I think that is a deadly consequence of--of allowing this type of misinformation to propagate through the services. 
DOYLE: Gentlelady's time has expired. Chair now recognizes Mr. Gianforte for five minutes. 
GIANFORTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all the panelists. This has been a very good discussion. I created my business on the back of the internet in the early 2000s. We eventually grew that from an extra bedroom in our home to one of the largest employers in Montana. We had 1,100 employees globally. And our website had about eight million unique visitors every single day. We're a good example that the internet has removed geographic barriers that previously prevented global businesses from operating in rural Montana and rural America. 
But, the internet can also have negative effects. Platforms can amplify similar voices and stifle others without much clarity. In a time when many were forced indoors, misinformation had even more disastrous effects. I understand how important Section 230 can be, especially for a small business, which doesn't have the resources of a large one. It's an important shield that also comes with a sword. 
There's been concern that certain companies are using their size to stifle certain voices. I believe it might be a lack of understanding by companies based in Silicon Valley. Back in March of last year, Missoula based Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation reached out to my office because one of their advertisements had been denied by Google over concerns of animal--animal cruelty. The ad featured a woman talking about going up hunting with her dad. There were no dead animals. There was no animal cruelty. It promoted our hunting heritage. 
As an avid hunter and outdoorsman myself, I know how many Montanans rely on hunting to provide for food for their families and as a way to enjoy our great outdoors. Many businesses in Montana promote hunting and fishing as it is their means to sell their outdoor sporting goods products. Will their businesses be denied the opportunity to advertise on a platform that owns a large portion of the market? Will they have to reach out to their member of Congress every time there's a ""misunderstanding?"" 
Well, there have been some troubling examples. I appreciated the quick response and willingness to engage from these platforms. We got the problem fixed. It just took a lot of work. It's difficult to regulate a dynamic industry, and hastily rushed to draft legislation could have more unintended consequences than solutions. 
Mr. Fried, in your testimony, you pointed to ways we can work together for a solution. I'm interested in what effect you think over prescriptive legislation--what sort of negative impacts would overly prescriptive legislation have on the sector? 
FRIED: I think that was me. So-- 
GIANFORTE: --Yeah-- 
FRIED: --That was for me. 
GIANFORTE: Yeah. 
FRIED: I really--I'm not advocating regulation. Right? We want all the experimentation. We want business models like the ones you talked about for your business. That's the innovation. Right? And so, (INAUDIBLE) you get protection for free expression from the Safe Harbor and C2 (SP). But, what we need to do is just say, ""Innovate, experiment, but know that you're going to be held accountable for your own decisions."" Every other business does that. It's just--it's personal responsibility. It's business responsibility. That will solve a lot of it. We don't have to be prescriptive. 
And the other beauty of this is you don't have to come up with different legislative solutions for every single ill on the internet. If you line up the incentives, the platforms will solve their own problems because they don't want to be sued. Right? That's what every other business does. We don't have to decide--there's a solution for this and a solution for that. Make them accountable for their own actions like every other business is. 
GIANFORTE: Thank you. And just as a follow on to that, Montana is a small business state. Innovation often happens in these small businesses. I'm concerned, as we look at public policy here, that, as small businesses compete with large businesses, that--and I understand your concept of duty of care. How should that apply differently for small businesses versus large business so we don't stifle--doesn't--the duty of care doesn't create a duty of burden so big that small companies can't actually be innovative? 
FRIED: So--so, the great news is it already is sort of--it--it solves its own problem. Reasonableness is a flexible standard. And certainly, a large company with lots of resources--what's reasonable for that company is different from what's reasonable for a small company. Right? So, the reasonableness standard will adjust to the size of the platform. 
Again, the small startup doesn't have as many users to moderate, isn't in 12 lines of business, has fewer uses. So, if it starts knowing, ""I'm accountable for what I do,"" it will build responsibility by design. It'll start small and responsible. And as it grows, it will have added resources to deal with other issue as they pop up. 
GIANFORTE: Thank you, Mr. Fried. 
FRIED: I think it--it solves (INAUDIBLE)-- 
DOYLE: --Gentleman's time has expired. Thank the gentleman. Chair now recognizes Ms. Blunt Rochester for five minutes-- 
BLUNT ROCHESTER: --Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the other chair and ranking members, to the panelists, especially Professor Overton, who I've had the opportunity to work with on future work issues, I say thank you. 
I'm--I'm struggling a little with this hearing because of the significance and the timeliness of it. I think back to when we had this conversation about Section 230 months ago and the fact that, at that time, we talked about the lack of diversity and inclusion in some of these platforms and in some of these companies and how, even when we talk about algorithms or we talk about humans who are--have--have biases that it impacts what we get out of--out of--out of this--this--you know, this system. 
And now, we are facing COVID-19, a pandemic, on top of a pandemic while we address racial and social issues that our country has long been plagued with. And what these platforms do are magnified. This--the--the current situation--and, as we've seen, they're also exploiting and--and actually just really making things worse. 
And while there are good portions of the internet and good things about these--these platforms, one of the challenges now is that we have a sense of urgency. The questions now are life and death. People can die if there's misinformation out there about--about COVID-19. People can die if violence is incited in people and they go out because of what they're reading on these platforms that are artificially targeting them. 
And our democracy can die. So, the sense of urgency I have--while today, what is beautiful is that I'm hearing Democrats and Republicans all say we have to face this. But, what I really want to say is to those platforms and to those tech companies, we're putting you on notice. This is our country. And this is really important. 
And so, for--for this moment, a lot of Americans--millions are asking themselves individually and collectively, what can I do? And so, I'm hoping that Mark Zuckerberg and Reddit and every--YouTube--everybody--you're holding up a mirror to yourselves. 
I'm going to ask a question. First of all, I'm going to share--Mr. Chairman, I submitted a letter for--into the record to Mr. Zuckerberg supported by 42 members of Congress and by leading civil rights organizations including the Leadership Conference, Color of Change, and the Joint Center. And I hope that this committee will consider having Mr. Zuckerberg and--and that he will see this moment as a wakeup call. And in that line, I wanted to mention that in 2018-- 
DOYLE: --Without objection, so ordered-- 
BLUNT ROCHESTER: --Thank you, sir. In 2018, Facebook hired an independent third party to conduct a civil rights audit. And we now have the results of the first two. And Ms. Collins-Dexter, the second audit report underscores the changes of policy Facebook was to take to address voter suppression. And the independent auditor stated that Facebook would implement new policies to further address these issues, such as an explicit ban on don't vote ads. Has Facebook followed through on these new policies? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: Thank you, Congresswoman. Facebook has not been consistent on following through on what they need to do. And I want to be clear, we--Facebook brought in Laura Murphy, formerly of the ACLU, to conduct a third-party audit. She did an AirBNB audit, which resulted in clear changes that still exist to this day, including infrastructure, permanent civil rights infrastructure. 
She, at Facebook, appears to have been--I feel like--blocked at every turn in terms of like what she recommends and how we see that play out in terms of like policy implementation. And though we've seen them move baby steps forward, we have no faith that they're actually going to go nearly as far as they need to. And to your points, the stakes are so incredibly high right now. We have to move with urgency. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you. And then, on the--the question of violent speech--it's already--the chairman has already pointed out the--the statement of the president that when the looting starts, the shooting starts and that Mr. Zuckerberg refused to take that--that down--that comment down. 
Ms. Collins-Dexter, please explain how this irresponsible policy by Facebook has the real potential to turn into violence. 
COLLINS-DEXTER: We've seen people directly impacted by violence in real ways. We've seen hate crimes go up significantly. We have had a lot of threats directed at us. I've had threats directed at me. The stakes are super real. And it--and--and one thing I do want to say to like--we talk about regulation as stifling innovation. I think, at its best, when government steps in and actually lays a new lay of the land and makes something possible, like through the New Deal and other moments in time, we see that innovation actually runs free. And I think that's what we need to be doing right now. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity. 
DOYLE: Gentlelady's time has expired. 
BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you. I yield back. 
DOYLE: Thank the gentlelady. Chair now recognizes Mr. Carter for five minutes. 
CARTER: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of our panelists for being here today. We appreciate the great discussion. I want to start with you, Mr. Fried--Neil. When we talk about online disinformation, I think it's important for us to--to--to note where we're at and--and how this applies to the COVID-19 pandemic right now. I think that's very important because a lot of the disinformation, particularly in regards to false health benefits, is--is--is very troublesome. 
And I wanted to ask you--I've got a bill. It's called the Combatting Pandemic Scams Act. And it--it really requires the federal government to--to push out best practices and awareness and--and really requires them to assimilate information about some of these scams and putting them all in a database and put them online so people can learn about it. How do you see this fitting into the--the larger online picture of--of disinformation? 
FRIED: I think it would be great to have that database. There's an impediment right now, which is--who is data? Would be very valuable to feed into that database. When we see patterns of misinformation coming from particular websites or particular names, often--they're often bogus names. But, there's pattern recognition here. 
If you see a certain name associated with every single misinformation site about COVID in a certain timespan, some security experts can say, ""Aha, here's a pattern. Next time we see information coming from this website, let's be suspect."" That helps law enforcement. That's helped--help cyber experts. It might even help algorithms. Right? If we want to prioritize or deprioritize, it helps to know. Is this a site that's likely purveying misinformation? But, we've lost access to a lot of--who is data--because of GDPR. I'd love to get that data back so we can build exactly those sorts of databases. 
CARTER: Do you--do you think it's important for the public to be brought up to date and to be kept up to date with this kind of information on these kind of ongoing scams? 
FRIED: Sure. And actually, there--there used to be. There still are some databases. But, they're growing stale because we're losing access to that--who is data. 
CARTER: Let me ask you another question. On June 22nd, the Wall Street Journal editorial board put out a piece about how the recent social justice movement has begun to move organizations to punish people for exercising their First Amendment rights on social media platforms. And--and we've--we've talked about that all throughout this discussion today, and we all understand what--what a difficult place we're in and--and how this can be done. But, it's got to be done carefully. We all understand that. 
But, despite the--the fact that some of the opinions were not negative in any way, they were still removed. Do you see a danger here? Do you see a danger and--of online platforms potentially creating a mentality or a pathway that could compromise people's First Amendment rights? 
FRIED: As you pointed out, this--this--we have to be very sensitive when we're talking about speech. I think that the best solution there is what a lot of both the witnesses and the members have talked about which is, first, transparency. What are the policies? Right? Second, what's the--what are the terms of service. Right? What--what are you going to be--what are the standards going to be and process? Right? What--who's been taken down for what reason? How can they appeal that? 
If we can track that information some sort of--sort of like a--I mean, often we get from the platforms transparency reports. Some of this is probably already being gathered. That kind of transparency will make sure we know why someone's being taken down, if there's been a mistake, how they can fix it. And we can see patterns over time that--then maybe we know--you know what--has there been good faith? Has there not been good faith? 
CARTER: You know, we've been talking about this--this subject for quite a while, for a long time, even when you were still in the committee, we were talking about it. And--and, you know, the message that I think we're all giving to the--to the platform owners and--and to those running the platforms is, ""You need to do it to yourself before we have to do it to you."" And I don't know how we get that message across to them. Right? I don't know--I don't want to have to do that. I don't want the federal government--because I'm--I'm really fearful that we're going to suppress innovation. And I don't want to see us do that. So, that's my concern here. 
Let me ask you one final question. Combatting disinformation is certainly important, and I believe it's also important to--to note that the suppression of real information doesn't--that doesn't fit a political narrative. For instance, there are some media platforms that like to emphasize the good things that the governor of New York has been doing. And he has been doing some good things. 
But, they fail to mention some of the things like putting patients in nursing homes, putting COVID-19 patients infected in nursing homes, which is the absolute worst thing you could do. How do you balance between that? How--how do--how do we balance on both sides of the aisle between that? 
FRIED: Again, let's--let's (INAUDIBLE) because that's how we analyze data and figure out what really is happening. And then, it's back to the marketplace of ideas. Right? The more platforms there are, the--the more avenues for expression--you make sure that the good data comes out. And--and those will attract consumers. And, again, that's the benefit of keeping C2--right--keeping the content moderation Safe Harbor of 230. So, we have all those platforms, all those opinions expressed. Just make sure that if there's something really nefarious happening, there's accountability for the platform. 
DOYLE: Gentleman's time has expired. 
CARTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
DOYLE: I thank the gentleman. Chair now recognizes Mr. Walberg for five minutes. 
WALBERG: (INAUDIBLE) here we go. There we go. Thanks--thanks for this hearing. It's--it's--it's something whose time has come. Let me follow up briefly on leader Walden's interest in having Jack Dorsey back before the committee. I'd like to enter into the record a New York Times article from yesterday on how Mr. Dorsey--his financial transactions company Square is withholding payments to thousands of small enterprises with little warning, who are desperately in need of these funds to stay afloat during the pandemic. And when these folks attempted to use Mr. Dorsey's other company, Twitter, to complain, they were blocked. I'd like to have that entered. 
DOYLE: Without objection, so ordered. 
WALBERG: Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fried, it also goes without saying, in relation to your testimony, that the courts have strayed away from the original congressional intent behind Section 230. At the advocacy courts that we have today--strayed away from a lot. So, this shouldn't surprise us. 
Can you please explain how judicial interpretation of Section 230 over the last two decades has not squared with its purpose? 
FRIED: Sure, Congressman. So, this really, as we, I think, all know now, started as a libel case. Right? And it was about Prodigy, who was doing the right thing, being a good Samaritan, missed something, and was punished for it. Right? They were essentially--were told--they weren't punished. But, they could have been held culpable because of their good faith efforts. That's what I think got Congress's concerns. That's what led to, you know, now Senator Wyden, Congressman Cox to--to rightly point out--we had a misincentive. 
We were actually discouraging people from moderating. That's what this law was supposed to be about. Unfortunately, it was written in a way that's been interpreted to do much more than that. It doesn't just--so, the first problem is it doesn't just protect the good Samaritan that's doing content moderation. It protects those that are doing no content moderation, inadequate moderation, and the bad Samaritans. That's the first problem. 
It also has gone way beyond defamation. Right? So now, we know it's applying to almost every gig economy, sex trafficking, other than (INAUDIBLE) now. Still have a problem with child pornography, (INAUDIBLE) materials, sale of drugs. And this--this C1 (SP) provision is being used to apply to all of that. That was never anybody's intention. Unfortunately, the language is amenable to that interpretation, which is why, if we fix C1, I think a lot of our problems get a lot better. It doesn't make everything go away. 
But, I think even just that change--and it can be modest--can make a lot of good and help a lot of these problems that every witness here is saying is a problem. It's every witness here. It's most witnesses at most of the panels and hearings you've been having. And it's all the victims. Right? All of us are saying the status quo isn't working. Something has to change. 
WALBERG: Yeah. And--and seeing--seeing the--the nodding of heads. I think we are in agreement on that. And it needs to move forward. Let me--Mr. Fried, you--you put forward in a--in your proposal--in your testimony that Congress should consider amending. And I think we've all talked about amending 230 to add reasonable duty of care in order to earn the liability protections under law. And we discussed that quite a bit today. But, could you expand on any key guiding principles that ought to be there for Congress to consider in--in retaining, in modifying the liability protections in Section 230? The guiding principles, those overriding guiding principles. 
FRIED: Save C2. Content moderation and Safe Harbor is important. That was the goal. Let's save that. Let's not try and regulate everything. Right? It--we don't want a patchwork. Right? That would be harmful. But, if you--if you right the incentives and recognize the difference between speech and illicit conduct, I think those are the guiding principles. Right? So, add to that transparency, and I think you can make a modest change to 230 that fixes the problem but saves all the benefit that has led to what is a wonderful internet. I mean, I don't want to be seen as a Luddite. The internet is great. But, we can keep the great parts of the internet and fix the problems from a misincentive in Section 230. 
WALBERG: Thank you. I yield my time. 
FRIED: Thank you. 
DOYLE: Thank the gentleman. I note that Mr. Sarbanes has waved onto the committee. And it gives me great pleasure now to recognize him for five minutes. 
SARBANES: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? 
DOYLE: I can hear you fine. 
SARBANES: Excellent. Well, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this hearing. Really outstanding panel. I appreciate all the testimony. I've been listening for the last two or three hours because it's a very important topic. 
So, we know that hostile actors, both foreign and domestic, sadly, have grown quite sophisticated in exploiting these platforms, these social media platforms to sow discord, to widen political division, and far too often, as we've heard, to suppress people's vote. Yet, as this hearing has shown, these platforms have been reluctant to deploy the full suite of their proven tools to combat the known threat. And it just doesn't have to be this way, from what I understand. 
While not perfect, the--the platforms response to this COVID-19 outbreak has at least given us a rough roadmap for how they can proactively--and I emphasize that word--proactively provide users with accurate information about our democracy, about our elections, while keeping harmful misinformation designed to suppress the vote from spreading on its (INAUDIBLE) on their platforms and so forth. 
For example, Facebook's efforts at addressing COVID-19 have included sending correct information (INAUDIBLE) users and notifying them when they've interacted with false information. So, there are steps that they can take. 
Professor Farid, simply as a matter of technological capacity, for the moment, can Facebook and the other platforms direct users to verified sources of information for those users who are known to interact with false information about voting? 
FARID: Absolutely. I mean, these are the ultimate data collecting and intelligence collecting corporations. They have a phenomenal amount of information of who we are, what we watch, what we see. And they absolutely have the technological and the data ability to inform us when we have been interacting with harmful content. 
Now, it remains to be seen if that is, in fact, helpful. Does correcting the record actually deal with the harms that happen earlier on? And there are some contradictory evidence in the literature that simply trying to correct the record will undo everything. That's just not the way human nature works. There's a boomerang effect. So, my preference is to avoid the contact in the beginning. But, if it does happen, this is absolutely a necessary, but it may not be a sufficient step. 
SARBANES: I agree with you. I think we need both. I think you all have given powerful testimony as why you need that kind of front end response to disinformation to try to protect the users from these things that can sow division and otherwise--and, in fact, distort our democracy. But, it's clear that they have the tools to do this both on the front end if, as you testified earlier, they're willing to put the resources and attention behind it in a meaningful way but also as evidenced by the way they've handled the COVID-19 disinformation, provide good, positive, corrected information on the back end when that is necessary and called for. 
Professor Overton, this discussion, I guess, begs the question--if the capacity exists for Facebook and these other platforms to have that kind of a response in their toolkit, what, from your perspective, can explain their reluctance to do it? 
OVERTON: Well, thanks for your leadership in terms of empowering small voices in terms of small donors, number one, in terms of public financing. So, just wanted to note that. 
I think, again, as Dr. Farid talked about, there are these financial incentives that companies have to look the other way, to basically say, ""Hey, we'll sell this ad that is targeted, employment ad that's targeted to whites and away from black. We'll sell this ad that's targeted at black communities in terms of voter suppression,"" without a lot of scrutiny. So, I think these financial incentives are there and that we need some other incentives like regulatory incentives possibly to--to address it. 
SARBANES: Thank you. Ms. Collins-Dexter, in the time I have left, in addition to proactively notifying users when (INAUDIBLE) interacted with false information, do you think Facebook and other platforms should take additional and affirmative steps of labeling or removing posts when that platform is being used for voter suppression and disinformation? 
COLLINS-DEXTER: We're finding in--in our organizing work that when disinformation gets out, even if you correct it or put a label over it, people retain the lie more than the truth. So, the content, I think, should come down. I think we also need to look at who are the verified users and how they may be pushers of disinformation and--and what are the consequences for that. 
SARBANES: Thank you very much. 
DOYLE: Gentleman's time has expired. I thank the gentleman. I want to thank my co-chair, Jan Schakowsky, for her good work and our Ranking Member Bob Latta and--and all the members. And I especially want to thank this outstanding panel. We have really enjoyed your testimony and--and the way you've responded to our questions. 
I want to remind all members that pursuant to our committee rules, that they have ten business days to submit additional questions for the record to be answered by the witnesses who have appeared, and I ask each witness to respond promptly to any such questions that you may receive. 
Before we adjourn, I'd like to request unanimous consent to enter the following records--the following documents into the record. 
First, a letter from the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a letter from the Coalition for a Safer Web, a letter from CCIA and Netchoice, a letter from Zeve Sanderson, executive director of NYU Center for Social and Media--Social Media and Politics, a letter from Public Knowledge, a statement from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, an essay by Mr. Spencer Overton, a Wall Street article, ""Facebook Executive Shut Down Efforts to Make the Site Less Divisive,"" a letter to Facebook on civil rights issues from Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester and others, a letter from the Lithuanian American Community, a letter from the Central and Eastern European Coalition, research from the (INAUDIBLE) on disinformation, letter from the Open Technology Institute, a letter from Consumer Reports, and last, but not least, an article from the New York Times entitled ""Square Jack Dorsey's Pay Service is Withholding Money Merchants Say They Need."" 
So, without objection, so ordered. And at this time, the committee is adjourned. "

Okay, the COVID-19 pandemic has upended our lives in ways that seemed unimaginable just a few months ago. 
We can all remember late March when the entire world seemed to be changing by the minute. Now Americans across the country are faced with both a health and economic crisis that is far from over and in many places within our country is only getting worse. 
Unprecedented is a word that probably gets overused, but it certainly applies to the situation at the U.S. Department of State. 
The U.S. Department of State faced many challenges during the pandemic. The U.S. government certainly has a long history of repatriating citizens but never before had so many Americans in so many different countries and regions needed to be repatriated at the same time. 
The challenge was not simply arranging enough flights to get Americans home, many Americans were located in rural areas and internal lockdowns in those countries often made it very difficult to get people to the cities where flights were leaving from. 
There were numerous instances where people needed to take boats in order to reach buses that took them to cities to get on flights. 
Often the State Department had to negotiate each of these travel plans individually with host governments. 
The effort was not seamless, especially in its early days. I heard from many people who were stuck abroad and felt that they weren't getting the support from the State Department that they needed. 
There were major technology issues with the STEP Program. There were also larger issues such as the announcement banning traveling to and from Europe which caused a panic resulting in overcrowded conditions in airports, during a pandemic. 
Overall, though, the State Departments repatriation effort has been a success. The State Department brought over 100,000 Americans home safely from 136 different countries and territories. 
This achievement is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our diplomats and civil servants who worked tirelessly and often at great personal risk to themselves and their families. 
The State Department also did a good job of keeping Congress informed of the repatriation efforts which allowed us to communicate with our constituents back home and many members of Congress as you all know, to the witnesses were receiving requests from constituents, often for their family members, who were somewhere abroad. 
It's all been difficult to convince folks of the value of the State Department, I think the repatriation campaign is a fantastic example of a tangible impact of how diplomats improve the lives of Americans. 
When faced with an unprecedented crisis, it was the U.S. State Department that got Americans home safely. 
Of course, we cannot simply rest on our laurels. One issue that will plague consular affairs for years to come is a lack of funding. 
Normally the Bureau of Consular Affairs is funded entirely by fees collected for services like issuing passports and visas. Even in the best of times, money is tight because the bureau can only charge what it costs to perform these consular services and hundreds of millions of dollars must be transferred to the Treasury and now travel has been nearly non-existent since late March and is likely to remain significantly reduced in the coming years. 
Today's hearing is an opportunity to discuss the bureau's fiscal situation as well. 
There are also other challenges that we must address. One is that many Americans now owe thousands of dollars for the repatriation flights that the State Department arranged to get them home. 
With the economy in tatters because of the pandemic, many of these folks are unable to pay for these flights. 
Even as countries begin opening up tourism, travel restrictions against Americans remain in place in almost every country, including among our closest allies in Europe. I hope we can discuss what the State Department is doing to remove these travel restrictions. 
This is work that is urgent as many Americans still remain in places other than their home, the United States and they'd like to get here and folks would like to travel and see relatives in other nations as well that right now are not allowing Americans to travel. 
Finally, I think there's a danger that the Trump administration will attempt to use this pandemic as an excuse to advance its anti-immigrant agenda. 
We saw this with the attempt to deport many foreign students, a move that provoked so much outrage the administration reversed itself and this is unlikely to be the last attempt to use the pandemic for political purposes. 
While safety must remain paramount, not only at home but also for our diplomats in public service and public servants in embassies around the world, we cannot forgo the openness that has made this country remarkable. 
This is true not only for moral reasons but also because immigration and tourism help propel our economy which is obviously in dire need. 
So, there is a lot of ground to cover and much to discuss but before introducing our witnesses today from the State Department, I'd like to turn over to our Ranking Member, Lee Zeldin of New York for his opening comments. 
ZELDIN: Thank you, Chairman Castro and thank you to our witnesses for being here today. 
During the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic, the State Department was faced with the ultimate challenge to protect and bring home American citizens abroad. 
As of June 2020, the State Department coordinated the repatriation of over 100,000 Americans on 1,140 flights from 136 countries and territories. 
They worked 24/7 to repatriate American citizens from around the globe using every available resource, from chartering flights to partnering with U.S. commercial airlines to printing emergency passports to make sure every American citizen who wanted to come home, could. 
With the help of the State Department, our office was able to bring many constituents home. 
Some of the stories are incredible. I'll briefly share with you two. 
A former Marine and his wife were taking a vacation in Peru when everything shut down. Under Marshall Law, Peru's hotels shut down leaving them stranded with no way out. 
The State Department worked with them, calling hotels to find space for them to sleep and make sure they were near the airport and ready to go the moment the plane arrived. 
Another one of my constituents was in the Canary Islands when the Coronavirus pandemic hit. His mother was being hospitalized in an ICU with pancreatitis in the Canary Islands in Spain. 
Working with the State Department we were able to secure a medical jet to transport his mother to the United States. 
I'd like to take the opportunity to thank those at the State Department for stepping up to the plate during these unprecedented times. 
We would like to hear from our witnesses today on the lessons they learned in the earliest days of this global repatriation effort, specifically I'd like to hear about the challenges faced in countries like Peru where there were significant number of American travelers who struggled getting home. We want to ensure that future repatriations can be carried out more smoothly. 
Over 10,000 Americans were repatriated from Peru including constituents from my district, but the process was not easy. 
The Peruvian government was blocking the return of U.S. citizens until it received assurances that its own citizens could leave the U.S., essentially holding American citizens hostage. 
That is unacceptable and must be met with a forceful diplomatic response that the U.S. will not tolerate this kind of threat. 
As part of our oversight mandate it is critical that this committee evaluate the strategies that were effective and look into possible ways to enhance State's abilities to repatriate American citizens in crisis. 
Additionally, the State Department has expressed concerns to this committee that it continues to see projected losses in fee revenues. 
Congress must ensure that agencies that rely on revenues from visa and passport fees have the personnel to handle the backlog. 
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how Congress can help, and I thank again the Chair for scheduling today's hearing, and I yield back. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Ranking Member Zeldin. 
I'll now introduce our distinguished witnesses and thank you all again for coming to testify. 
Our witnesses for today's hearing are Ian Brownlee, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for consular affairs and Karin King, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for oversees citizens services and I'll now recognize each witness for five minutes and without objection your prepared written statements will be made a part of the record. 
And I'll first call on Mr. Brownlee for his testimony. 
BROWNLEE: Chairman Castro, Ranking Member Zeldin and members of the subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify today. 
I'd like to thank all of your offices for your help and the support you gave us as we worked together to repatriate those thousands of your constituents, our fellow Americans. 
This has truly been an all of government effort. We coordinated with the CDC, DHS components, DOT, DoD and the Congress to bring home over 110,000 U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents worldwide. 
Throughout this outbreak, we provided first daily, then twice weekly briefings to both the House and the Senate to keep you updated on our progress in helping your constituents overseas. 
Thank you also for the additional appropriations and legislative authorities you provided in recent supplementals supporting our ability to continue our work. 
Without that assistance we would not be able to continue helping those U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents overseas 
To help manage the change in workload and support our staff overseas, the Department of State established a repatriation taskforce, including subunits focused on Congressional inquiries and cruise ships. 
At our posts overseas, officers who normally adjudicated visas, shifted to American citizen services work, allowing the department to focus resources on our number one priority overseas, providing assistance to U.S. citizens. 
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your recognition of the foreign service and civil servants but I'd like to add to that my thanks to our locally employed staff and eligible family members who played a key role in exercising everything we did during the repatriation of these U.S. citizens. 
On March 20th, the Department temporarily suspended routine visa processing and we began to significantly reduce passport operations. These dual actions were taken for the health and safety of both our employees and our customers. 
We project a more than 50 percent drop in visa fee revenue and a similarly dramatic decline in passport fee revenue due to COVID-19 with total projected losses of over $1.4 billion this fiscal year. 
We also foresee a continued strain on fee revenue throughout the next fiscal year. 
Thanks to the temporary expenditure authority provided in the CARES Act, we've used the carry forward balances from certain fee revenue to maintain consular operations this fiscal year. However, we are on track to substantially deplete balances in those accounts by the end of this fiscal year. 
Most of the Departments consular funding comes from fees collected from visa applicants and our current fee authorities allow us to use a portion of these fees to cover the cost of providing essential services to U.S. citizens abroad. 
CA's fee for service model relies on a stable flow of visa and passport applicants to fund those activities and extraordinary activities such as large-scale repatriations. 
The pandemic has severely disrupted consular fee revenue. Our normal income is $3.5 billion annually. Relative to FY 2019 we expect a drop of more than $1.4 billion this year and a comparable loss in the next fiscal year. 
To continue offering emergency and routine services to U.S. citizens overseas, including overseas voting assistance this election year, we need additional authority such as that requested in the FY 2021 budget to better achieve full cost recovery and to maintain continuity of operations for these essential services until the anticipated recovery of demand, currently projected for FY 2023. 
Specifically, regarding U.S. citizen services, the administration's FY 2021 budget proposes allocating the cost to providing U.S. citizen services to security surcharges applied to certain visas. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Zeldin. 
I look forward to answering your questions and those of the other members of the subcommittee. 
My colleague, deputy assistant secretary Karin King will speak more about our assistance to U.S. citizens. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Mr. Brownlee. 
Ms. King. 
KING: (OFF MIC) 
CASTRO: I think you need your microphone on. No worries. 
KING: Chairman Castro, Ranking Member Zeldin, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. 
I am proud to be here representing not only the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, OCS here in Washington but the consular officers and locally engaged staff worldwide who assist U.S. citizens every day under challenging circumstances. 
I assure you; you will not find a more dedicated team of public servants anywhere. 
Since the first news of the novel Coronavirus outbreak in China, OCS has been at the center of an around the clock effort to inform U.S. travelers of the risks related to COVID and to bring home those caught overseas. 
The global consular teams worked during the COVID outbreak is giving Congress and the American public an opportunity to see the broad range of actions OCS and consular officers in the field take every day to support U.S. citizens overseas. 
Although the COVID pandemic is unprecedented, we are not new to the business of repatriating citizens in need. 
We are not new to the business of communicating accurate, actionable, lifesaving advice to citizens. 
Protecting health and safety of U.S. citizens abroad and helping them get home when they are in need has always been my office's core mission. 
PDAS Brownlee described the extraordinary efforts the Department's task force undertook to expand our capacity to support our citizens overseas and OCS is deeply grateful for the way in which the entire department mobilized during this crisis. 
OCS staff comprised the core task force staffing and I pledge to you and the citizens we serve that OCS continues to monitor the provision of services to Americans worldwide and will continue to support repatriation efforts when and where needed. 
OCS officers are in constant touch with their colleagues at embassies and consulates overseas and they provide policy and logistical crisis management guidance around the clock. 
More broadly, OCS maintains close contact with other State Department offices as well as the interagency partners that comprise the COVID task force. 
We are fully prepared to flex as needed to support any renewed demand for repatriations and we will call on the larger Bureau of Consular Affairs to bolster us as needed. 
OCS officers maintain the consular information program that is the foundation of our efforts to protect U.S. citizens. 
Our products include travel advisories, country information pages and timely alerts issued directly by our overseas posts. 
These products provide U.S. citizens with fact-based information designed to enable Americans overseas to make well informed decisions regarding their safety. 
Our travel advisories in particular have also become invaluable to professionals in the travel, insurance and private security sectors. 
The travel advisory system assigns each country an advice level ranging from one, exercise normal precautions to four, do not travel, derived from metrics based rubrics that assess crime, terrorism, kidnapping, hostage taking, civil unrest, natural disaster, health and other risks. 
The COVID pandemic poses unprecedented health and logistical risks for travelers and we are working closely with experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC to ensure that our travel advisories take into account the latest data in each country. 
In tandem with CDC, OCS issued an unprecedented level four, do not travel global travel advisory in March. With conditions improving in some countries, we are following CDC's lead and returning to previous country specific travel advice levels. 
As much as I hope we are never again confronted with a crisis requiring us to repatriate more than 100,000 U.S. citizens, we are ready to do so if needed. In fact, we are already working on how we would do it better. 
Rethinking and innovating in the face of challenges is critically important and we are currently engaged in a lessons learned effort to identify action items that will enhance our responsiveness and effectiveness. 
I second PDAS Brownlee's request to work with you to ensure funding for OCS's not exclusively reliant on revenue sources outside of the Department's control. 
The services we provide to U.S. citizens are just too important. 
Our office has the privilege of safeguarding the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. I'm proud to lead a team of foreign affairs professionals that serve our country and fellow citizens incredibly well. 
I reiterate my thanks to the Chairman and Ranking Member for this opportunity to address you. I look forward to answering your questions. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Ms. King. We appreciate your testimony very much and I now recognize members for five minutes each and pursuant to House rules, all time yielded is for the purposes of questioning our witnesses. 
Because of the hybrid format of this meeting, I will recognize members by committee seniority, alternating between democrats and republicans. 
If you miss your turn members, please let our staff know and we'll circle back to you. If you seek recognition you must unmute your microphone and address the Chair verbally. 
I'll start now by recognizing myself. 
The Bureau of Consular Affairs is typically funded through the fees it collects for performing consular services. 
Obviously, the pandemic has drastically reduced demand for consular services. We understand as you mentioned that the Department expects revenues to decline by $1.4, $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 with a continued decline expected in fiscal year 2022. 
This is an astonishing amount of money given that in recent years revenue has been about $4 billion. 
And so, as I mentioned, you described some of the fiscal situation, particularly Mr. Brownlee, but let me ask you, what actions is the bureau taking to account for these dropping revenues and what would be the impact of these falling revenues? 
In other words, what's the longer-term impact of this? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, thank you very much for your question sir. 
We are approaching this as you correctly note, an astonishing decline in revenue, down essentially two paths. 
One is we are seeking to affect now, immediately savings in our expenditures. We have identified some, let me make sure I get the number correct here, we identified some $359 million in savings from the--from the FY 2020 budget. 
CASTRO: Do you have a sense where those savings are coming from, a rough sense? 
BROWNLEE: A very rough sense, sir. 
We have contracts, for example we have contracts overseas where we have what we call greeters, assistants who move people through visa waiting rooms, obviously in these times of greatly reduced visa demand we don't need people moving through waiting rooms. 
There are similar services. We're looking at a number of other projects as well, both domestically and overseas where we can hold off on expending money or just not spend it at all. 
We're looking a fairly significant reduction in this year's spending. 
We are also, considering we have used the money thank you very much to the Congress for the authorities given to us in the CARES Act to go into prior unexpended balances that have been carried forward. 
So, without getting into great detail, our fees bring in funds from a number of different sources, visa fees, passport fees, some surcharges. We had the broadest authority to spend what we call the MRV fee, the machine-readable visa fee. That was the one that was carrying us. 
With the systemic decline in visa demand that was taking place even before the COVID crisis hit, we were facing a problem and we'd been requesting authority to spend for example the passport security surcharge, to expend those funds to support our ADAS King's operations overseas. 
CASTRO: Can I interject just for a second. 
I have one more question after this, I've got about two minutes left. 
But on this issue, let me ask you this, are Americans going to have a different experience utilizing your services because of this. 
What is that going to look like? Is it going to take longer? What are you anticipating? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, sir for the question. 
With regard to our services overseas, it is our key priority. We are not going to put Karin's operations out of business because of this. 
We are going to make sure that those operations continue unabated consistent with what we can do safely, bringing the number of people into a waiting room, that sort of thing. 
They may see some change in that respect, but health considerations may require us to restrict the number of people in a waiting room. 
With regard to domestic services, passport services, we have reinitiated the provision the adjudication of passports. 
Beginning I think it was on June 11th, in early June, we began, we brought in we declared our entire staff to be mission critical. That brought approximately 50 percent of the staff back into the office to do adjudications and we have made significant, very significant progress in reducing the backlog that had developed in March, April, May and early June. 
CASTRO: Thank you for that and got about 45 seconds left, 40 seconds left. 
But let me ask you, some countries have started to not allow Americans travel to their countries. Can you all tell me how many nations are currently not allowing Americans to travel to their countries? 
BROWNLEE: No, sir I cannot tell you that off the top of my head, but I will get you that answer, sir. 
CASTRO: Sure, okay, thank you. 
I'll turn it over to Ranking Member Zeldin. 
ZELDIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
Congress informed the committee yesterday that of the $588 million of emergency money provided to the Department in the CARES Act, $462 million has been notified for use but only $104 million has been obligated. 
What are the plans for the remaining $126 million that has not been notified? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, Mr. Zeldin for the question. 
I'm going to have to take that sir. 
I am aware of what we are doing in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, we are grateful for the support given to the Bureau of Consular Affairs in the CARES Act but on the broader departmental question, we're going to have to get back to you sir, thank you. 
ZELDIN: Go ahead, Ms. King. 
KING: Yes, I would just say in terms of monies to be used for U.S. citizen repatriations we are using all the money we need for repatriation purposes. 
ZELDIN: Would either of you have any comments as to why only $104 million has been obligated so far? 
KING: I would say again, where we have needed to use the funds specifically for repatriations and for evacuations, we have used that money, so to the degree that we haven't used more of it is because we haven't yet had the need to do so. 
ZELDIN: Great. Thank you. 
State has said it is using the repatriation loans programs--program account to help U.S. citizens pay for costs associated with commercial rescue flights operated by private air carriers. 
How much funding has the State Department obligated from the repatriation loans program account for this purpose? 
KING: I am going to have to get back to you with a specific number. I know that we have met our authorization and so at this point we are using K funds for repatriation purposes, but I will have to get back to you with where we are with a specific number today. 
ZELDIN: With respect to individuals who lack the means to repay such loans, what actions if any does the State Department take? 
KING: The State Department works with the Department of Treasury so when somebody is repatriated, there is a hold put on their passport until they have repaid the loan and we work very closely with Treasury to get the loan repayment. 
ZELDIN: Any insight though to share if an individual lacks the ability to repay the loan? 
KING: The passport will remain held until they are able to repay the loan. 
ZELDIN: In January 2020 State announced the launch of the Center for Analytics to improve data management and analytic efforts to support diplomatic missions abroad. 
The head of the center, the first ever Chief Data Officer Janice deGarmo, said she had developed a repatriation briefing book to support the repatriation task force. 
Would you be able to discuss the way this technology aided your efforts to track and analyze data, repatriation requests and flight information? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, Mr. Zeldin for your question. 
Yes, I found it very useful as the head of the repatriations task force, that became required reading for me, the repatriations briefing book. 
Initially it was coming out three times a day. As the efforts continued the frequency decreased but it was extraordinarily useful in seeing where trends were developing, what region of the world. 
For example, the western hemisphere remained a key focus for us but as time went on, we saw for example there were more people trying to get out of Europe. 
We were intrigued to find there were relatively few people trying to come out of East Asia, Pacific Region. It was very, very, helpful to us in deciding where to devote resources as we move forward. 
ZELDIN: Why I thank you both. I--I think that the last answer, kind of, might have answered my last question. But I'll ask anyway, in case you have any other insight on it. What work has the state department's COVID-19 data analytics team done to evaluate changing conditions around the world to help ensure states preparedness and responding to new localized outbreaks of COVID-19? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, Sir, for the question. We are continuing to track conditions around the world. Mainly, through our ACS sections, coming back to the Office of Overseas Citizen Services, to ascertain where people--U.S. citizens are expressing some degree of interest in returning to the United States. And, it's important to recognize that 'some degree of interest' phrase in there. 
We have relatively few people these days who are saying, I need to go now. We have people who say, well, if conditions change, if conditions worsen, what have you; I would like to go. So, we are closely tracking that number. The Center for Data Analytics is helping us do that. And, that allows us to determine whether we might need to lay on additional flights to this place or that place. 
ZELDIN: Thank you. And, I just want to say thank you to both you, Mr. Brownlee, Ms. King, to your teams; there were a lot of challenges with regards to the pandemic, but your accessibility and the efforts around the world, certainly were noticed, I believe on both sides of the aisle here in Congress and by many of our constituents. I yield back. 
CASTRO: Well, absolutely. Thank you, ranking member. We'll go now to Mr. Malinowski, New Jersey. 
MALINOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to you both for being here with us and just to reiterate Mr. Zeldin's point that the department has been very responsive, very--very present when we've needed help with a particular constituent. That said, we need help. And, there are--there are some concerns I have about where we are right now, in terms of providing services to people who need them. 
Let me just give you a couple of examples. I--I have a constituent an American citizen, who-- whose wife made a very difficult journey to Addis, in Ethiopia, in March, for a visa appointment. It was understandably canceled, in March. But it's a little bit harder for me to explain to that family, why now, in July, we still cannot tell them when this American citizen's wife might get an expedited appointment. 
She has DHS--her paperwork; everything in order. Another case, I have an American citizen child, in my district whose Indian father was here on an H1B visa, happened to go back to India in March, because his father--his father had passed away, went back for the funeral. And, his appointment for his H1B renewal was canceled, again. Understandably, in March. But a little bit less understandable, a little bit harder to under--to explain to that child, why in July, we still can't tell him when his father might be able to get that appointment. 
So, I guess my question is why is it that at this point, especially with the resources we've given you, we cannot conduct expedited interviews, in these relatively few cases? Where there's an American family that is broken up? Here we are meeting by video conferencing, here. You certainly have that capacity, technologically, to conduct interviews. 
You have the legal authority to waive the personal appearance requirement in cases where the national interest argues for it or if there's an unusual or exigent circumstance. When can we expect progress in this area? To either of you who wants to take that. 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, Mr. Malinowski, for your questions. I agree the separation of family is heartrending. I'm pleased to say that, I think was last Wednesday, July 15th, we sent instructions to the field on how to resume routine visa operations. 
This will be largely dependent upon the condition that diplomacy strong, and you understand what I say--yeah--that the phase of diplomacy strong, in which a particular post is, for those posts that are in--in the--that, the later phases, two and three, will be subject to essentially chief of mission, the emergency action committee can decide. 
You know, that's where they are. They--the post may undertake routine visa services, consistent with good health practices, safety, etc. The post's that are at phases zero and one may come into the department to request permission to conduct certain sorts of visa applications; that--visa adjudications. 
So, for example, we're seeing requests coming in from some post to begin doing student visa applications. So, this is getting underway now. One of the difficulties we're finding is, this is not a static situation. I was briefing at DCM headed to a European post, just yesterday. As our conversation began, we were discussing how his soon-to-be post, was at phase two. One of the staffers in the EUR Bureau broke in partway through the conversation and said, I'm sorry, this post just asked to go back to phase one. 
MALINOWSKI: So, what about the--what about waiving the in-person requirement? You've done that apparently, I think. (INAUDIBLE) 
BROWNLEE: We have--yes, Sir. We've done this with regard to certain workers, for example, the agricultural workers, coming out of Mexico, the H2As. 
MALINOWSKI: So, why not students and scholars? Why not other categories? 
BROWNLEE: We--I would be happy to take the question under advisement, Sir, with regard to this particular--specifically with regard to those constituents. We're looking at everything we can do to get these operations moving, as quickly as possible. 
MALINOWSKI: Okay. I mean, let me just close with a final comment, that I find almost painful to make. But we all first and foremost, want to protect the safety of U.S. government employees. If I were a foreign service family with kids, wanting to enroll them in school, right now, I--I can think of a large number of countries where I would feel safer than the United States of America. 
If we were going to apply that phasing system to ourselves; we would not actually rank very highly. And, and I wonder whether we can do more to take that into account? As hard as it is to acknowledge, how poorly we are doing in response to this crisis domestically, in making these sorts of determinations. And, with that, I yield back. Thank you very much. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Mr. Malinowski. Alright, I'm going to ask a few questions, 'cause as you can imagine the bells rang for votes and folks are scrambling to go vote. And then, we have one or two people who are interested in asking some questions. Hopefully, that will give them a chance to come back. If not, we'll probably recess for about 10 or 15 minutes and give them a chance to come back at that point. 
So, I want to ask you because we have been and still are affected by this pandemic, what safety protocols you're now taking, in terms of when you deliver the services and Americans take advantage of the services that you offer; what protocols have been put in place that officers are, you know, putting up to ensure the safety of the officers, for example? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman for the question. We're using protocols very similar to those you are using here, Sir. We are keeping people at a safe remove--one from another. We are not--only letting so many people into, for example, a visa waiting room. We have not yet begun expedited passport service, where we have people being exposed at the physical counter, yet. We're doing everything we can to begin moving our processes, as quickly as possible, consistent with good--good conduct and safety. 
CASTRO: And, is there a mechanism for officers to communicate their concerns and to work through scheduling options, that give them more confidence in performing their work? 
BROWNLEE: Yes Sir, there is. I participate in, I think, they're thrice-weekly meetings, with the Deputy Under Secretary for Management, where we discuss what it will take to reopen various aspects of the State Department, domestically. 
And so, you know, going back to Mr. Malinowski's observation, we obviously--we have the domestic diplomacy strong undertaking. And, we are looking at--at individual regions around the country, National Capital Region. We have passport operations all over the country, as the conditions change in those areas, we decide whether we may more or less, reopen there. 
CASTRO: Okay. And, given the backlog of visa applications that built up while embassies and consulates were closed, how will the State Department prioritize visa applications, once offices are reopened? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you, Sir. What we're doing is as I said, we sent instructions to the field just six days ago now, telling them, as I said earlier to Mr. Malinowski, how they may go about reopening; depending on which phase of diplomacy strong they are now. For those posts, for example, New Zealand, that's fairly wide open, they may--they may move forward-- 
CASTRO: Let me interrupt you for just a second because we lost our quorum because people have gone to vote. So, we're going to recess here, for just a bit, alright. 
(RECESS) 
CASTRO: The committee will come back to order. And, I know that we were in the middle of the answer to one of my questions, but if got anything further to add on--as an answer to that question? And, when you're done, I will turn over to, let me see, David, actually Ted, and then David. I see--I see David. So, any final words on that answer or were you-- 
BROWNLEE: I think I--I think I was substantially done. Thank you, Sir. 
CASTRO: Okay, Mr. Cicilline. 
CICILLINE: Thank you, Chairman Castro. And, thank you to our witnesses for being here. During the peak of--the first kind of surge of the coronavirus back in April, there were many governors that were pleading for more health care workers and at the same time, the New York Times was reporting that foreign health workers had been lining up to take jobs in American hospitals, but had been prevented from doing so. 
And, they described the roadblocks that included their inability to get visas, not being allowed to travel to the United States, even if they had a visa. And, in other cases, foreign health workers inside the country were not allowed to extend their visas. 
So, my first question is what is Counselor of Affairs doing to ensure that foreign house workers who are able and willing to help during this health emergency, are able to get visas and travels to the United States or remain here, in the United States? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you very much for your questions, Sir. I can address what we were doing with regard to those foreign health workers who are overseas, seeking visas to travel to the United States. With regard to those who are in the United States already, seeking to extend their stay, I would have to refer you to the Department of Homeland Security, specifically, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; which is responsible for the extension of a period of stay in the United States. 
With regard to those who are overseas, right from the beginning, we have prioritized giving visa appointments--getting visa interviews to certain classes of people, including health workers coming to help us address the COVID-19 panic. There may have been some confusion in the initial weeks, but since then, the assistant secretary for Consular Affairs has made it clear and has in fact acted upon that clarity, that we need to make it possible for these health workers to come here, assuming they have the necessary work authorizations. Thank you, Sir. 
CICILLINE: Thank you. And, on July 6th, ICE announced that students taking only online classes would not be eligible for student visas, then on July 14th, they rescinded this policy. And, my question is where any applicants denied student visas between July 6th and the 14th, on the basis of ICE's announcement? And, if so, will those applicants be given and notified of an opportunity to reapply? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you very much for your questions, Sir. I do not know the answer specifically; I will have to get back to you on that one. 
CICILLINE: Okay, I'd appreciate that. Ms. King, as you know countries around the world including some of our most important allies are beginning to allow people to travel to their countries again, with very few exceptions, the United States has remained on a list of countries who are not welcome. A more cynical person might just say that while President Trump has thankfully failed to build his wall, along our border with Mexico; his horrendous response to the coronavirus has erected a different kind of wall, one that prevents Americans from leaving our own country. 
And, what I'd like to know is what role the State Department is playing with our allies and other governments around the world to address the concerns so that, Americans can travel again. In particular, had these governments provided specific metrics to the United States, that will have to be met in order for Americans to be allowed to travel to their countries? 
KING: Thank you for the question. I know that many countries especially in Europe, are looking epidemiologically at whether or not it is prudent for them to allow U.S. citizens in at this time. And, I know that we were having very close conversations with governments throughout the world, to see whether we can reach agreement on the comfort levels that they might have with allowing U.S. citizens in. 
I will tell you what my office is doing; we are working on our travel advisory, to bring it down from the global level 4, which right now, advises U.S. citizens against traveling anywhere in the world. We are working very closely with the CDC, which is also looking at risk levels overseas for U.S. citizens so that we can provide accurate advice. 
And, I'm hoping that in the near future, we will be at a point where there will be some countries where we can again advise U.S. citizens that although it may not be completely safe to travel, we will no longer be saying, do not travel. 
CICILLINE: You know, I appreciate that, but my question really relates to countries that are prohibiting U.S. citizens from traveling to those countries; not the policy of the United States, policies of our allies. And, to the extent that there are metrics that they are furnishing to the United States that must be met before U.S. travel will be permitted. 
It would be useful to know what those metrics are. I think would help guide our response, here in the United States. And so, if we have specific metrics from allies or other countries, saying you must meet these metrics before we allow Americans to travel here, it will be very useful for Congress to know that and to see those metrics and I'd ask you to make them available to us if they exist. And, with that, I will yield back. 
KING: Yes. Our regional bureaus are working very closely with governments. Again, specifically, the governments in European countries, to see what their basis is for deciding whether or not U.S. citizens may enter. 
And, I know in Europe, in the Schengen countries particularly, they are looking at epidemiological markers, very similar to what CDC is looking at, in determining whether foreigners should be allowed into the United States. So, if there's a desire for more details on what those markers are, I'm happy to talk to our regional bureau colleagues about the details. 
CASTRO: No. Thank you. And, I do think that that is an important question Mr. Cicilline asked, which is, you know, we know now that there's a growing list of countries that have prohibited Americans from traveling there. And, people have family members in these countries, that they'd like to visit at some point, obviously. 
So, it will be important for us to understand what it's going to take to allow Americans to get back to those places. So, we'll follow up with you all, on that. With that, I'll go to Mr. Lieu, of California. 
LIEU: Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the witnesses for your dedicated public service; we all really appreciate that. I--two areas are inquiry, the first, I want to start out by thanking Secretary Brownlee and your great work with repatriation. I know that we had about 20 some constituents that needed to be repatriated. 
We worked with your task force and they were all repatriated. And so, thank you for that. My question related that issue is, and I'm sorry if this has been asked before; I was told that some airlines and perhaps U.S. airlines as well, we're not particularly helpful in this effort. So, I wanted to know if that was true? And, if it was, what ways can we make sure that they're more helpful next time? 
BROWNLEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Lieu. And, thank you--thank you for your--your kind words, about the efforts of the task force; it was a remarkable effort, bringing together people from across the State Department, across the U.S. interagency, and frankly, across the globe. So, we were--it is remarkable to have been involved in such a such an undertaking. 
With regard to the airlines, we found that as the--the confusion of the border closings took place, our economic bureau undertook conversations with U.S. legacy carriers and others, to see whether they would be available to conduct flights into certain areas. We--in some cases they were unable or unwilling to--to go into areas. In other cases, they were. 
So, for example, the legacy care--or the follow-on to the legacy carrier, Eastern Airlines, a U.S., a small U.S. company, proved to be very, very, helpful in going into areas in the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. When we sought to bring people out of, for example, India; the question became more complex. 
And, I don't think I would characterize the airlines as--U.S. airlines as being uncooperative; it simply wasn't commercially viable for them to fly from the United States to India to pick up half--to pick up a load and then bring it back again. And, this got them into--the problems arose from such things as crew rest regulations, they need to fly two crews from say San Francisco to New Delhi. 
So, in the end there, we ended up going with Air India, which didn't have those same crew rest issues, they could--they could initiate their travel, in India, pick up a planeload of people, bring them to the United States. So, there was--there was much confusion, but I don't think that I would characterize the airlines as uncooperative. Thank you, Sir. 
LIEU: Helpful to know. I appreciate that. So, the second subject I want to talk about is, what do we call this virus? So, let me start by saying that what China did at the beginning in suppressing information about this virus is not defensible, and we should rightly criticize China for doing that. At the same time, this virus already has an official name, COVID-19. 
It has an unofficial name, Coronavirus. And, the CDC has said that we should not have hashed ethnic identifiers to this virus 'cause it can lead to discrimination. And, we already see across America, that there have been approximately 1900 hate crimes incidents, against Asian Americans. Including, an Asian American family in Texas, that was stabbed, because the perpetrator thought they were spreading this virus. 
And, I understand you can't control with the President of the United States says, but when the president or other administrative officials use terms like Chinese virus or Kung flu, it does fuel hatred against Asian Americans. And, it leads to hate crimes against Asian Americans. So, I just want all of you to understand that, words do matter. And, when you stick ethnic identifiers in front of a virus that affects everyone, it could lead to very harmful effects against Americans, who happen to be of Asian descent. 
And, my question to you is, is there any official State Department policy on what you call this virus? And, before you answer, I also want to say that, you know, we don't call the swine flu the North American virus, even though it started in North America. The Spanish flu did not start in Spain, it likely started in Kansas. 
So, there's no reason to call this the Chinese virus. If you want to say the virus came from China, I think that's fine, that's very different than how some other people use terms that can inflame people against Asian Americans. So, if you could answer my question about whether there is a policy on what you call this virus, that'd be great. 
BROWNLEE: Within the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Sir, we refer to the carrier of the virus as the novel coronavirus, the disease that novel coronavirus causes is called COVID-19, there was a pandemic generated by the widespread infection by COVID-19. 
LIEU: Thank you. I appreciate that. And, I urge all federal agencies to do what you all do, and I hope the President of the United States understands he is president, for not just some Americans, but all Americans. And, that he understands his words can cause hatred, towards a certain subset. And, I wish he would just call this virus by its official name. With that, I yield back. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Mr. Lieu. Mr. Lieu makes an important point as well, that the president's language has been incendiary in how he's described this virus. And, attacks against Asian Americans, as you all probably have seen, have skyrocketed during this pandemic in no short measure, because of how the president has described this virus, and others as well. 
With that, I'm going to go over to Debbie Dingell, but first I need to read just a few lines. I ask unanimous consent for Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, to participate in this hearing and ask questions after all, subcommittee and committee members have done so. Hearing no objection, I'll go to Debbie Dingell of Michigan. 
DINGELL: Thank you, Chairman Castro, and to Ranking Member Zeldin for convening this important hearing, to discuss the COVID pandemic and its impact on the State Department's Consular programs. As today's witnesses have outlined, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the evacuation of 100,000 Americans, on over 1000 flights, from 136 countries and territories. And, quite frankly, a number of them have been from my district. 
However, these evacuations can come at a substantial cost for Americans abroad, as they are required to pay the equivalent of a ticket on a commercial flight from the area, in which they are evacuated. Additionally, the State Department will put a hold on the individual's passport until the amount is repaid; this resulting cost is often very surprising to individuals at the amount of it. 
Ann Ferguson and several of my constituents discovered, when being evacuated from the Caribbean in 2017, so this is before COVID, they had their pay hundreds and thousands of dollars in reparations loans, each. That's why congressman Jim McGovern and I have introduced the Leave No Americans Behind Act, which would end the State Department's practice of charging these fees. 
Mr. Brownlee, I'd like to ask you some questions. Can you provide details on the total cost of the repatriation efforts? Specifically, how much did the entire campaign cost the State Department, what were the cost of the flights? 
BROWNLEE: I'm sorry, pardon me. Thank you, Ms. Dingell, for your questions. I have here in front of me information that indicates that in repatriating the over 190--I'm sorry, 110,00 people the Department spent over $195 million dollars. Specifically, over $196 million dollars. I have a breakdown beyond that if you're interested. But it's a total of $196 million dollars. How we arrived at the individual costs of a particular flight; that is governed by law and regulation. 
We are required by law to take a promissory note from anybody for whom we put onto one of these K-fund chartered flights. The amount of that promissory note is fixed by the Bureau of Administration within the State Department. And, essentially what it comes down to is, what one would have paid for a ticket if one had showed up at the airport in say, Santo Domingo, looking for a flight to the United States, the day before the crisis hit. 
So, the immediate pre-prices--pre-crisis flight--price. As the effort to repatriate people, it-- continued, we expanded our lift capacity by bringing in commercial carriers, as well. In some cases they were able to do this for less than what we would have charged; in other cases, they found they could only make money by doing--by charging more than we would have charged, for a corresponding flight. 
In any case, we left nobody behind, for reasons of money; either people could come back using a promissory note, on one of the K-fund charter flights or the American citizen services section in the country in question, could issue the personal a repatriation loan. And, we issued a very significant number of repatriation loans or have issued a very significant number of Patriot-- repatriation loans, during this crisis. 
As of, I'm sorry I don't have the exact date, we hit our congressionally mandated cap on the repatriation loan program of about $5.6 million dollars about a month or two ago. And, since then we have been--we have issued I think some $2 million dollars approximately, in repatriation loans coming out of the K-fund. I hope this answers your questions ma'am. 
DINGELL: I have a lot more questions. I appreciate the information. I'm going to have to be fast 'cause I'm down to 45 seconds. But you know that a number of individuals are unemployed. They're now having very real financial situations. How do we help them in repaying these notes? 
And, many other countries who assisted in the repatriation of their citizens didn't charge their citizens or their family members to return home. So, in the State Department's assessment of actions you've have taken during this time, are you looking at charging citizens an emergency something under consideration to change or how you help people, in these dire times? 
CASTRO: I mean, you all can give a full answer on that. We're waiting for--there may be one more member that's got questions. So, go ahead and Debbie if you have another question, go ahead too. 
DINGELL: Well, let's get the answer to that one. 
KING: The requirement to obtain reimbursement from U.S. citizens on pursuant to issuing a repatriation loan, is a matter of statute. So, the U.S.--the Department of State does not have a choice in that matter. Again, our goal in Consular Affairs is to make sure people get out of harm's way, absolutely as quickly as possible. And, that in some cases does require the repatriation loan program. But we are not in a position to forgive those loans, given the statute. 
DINGELL: So, that's why we need the Leave No American Behind law, that Jim and I have introd--have introduced. So, individuals who boarded the State Department charter flights had to sign promissory notes promising to pay this State Department back. 
And, some of them are now finding they don't have the passports; not that anybody's really should be traveling right now. But they need it for other reasons. And, they're hitting credit issues, etc. How much in dollar value right now, do you think is out there in promissory notes? 
BROWNLEE: Ma'am, thank you for the question. We understand that some $7.5 to $8 million in--in repatriation loans are outstanding. In terms of promissory notes, we're going to have to get you that-- 
DINGELL: Thank you. 
BROWNLEE: --we're going to have to get you that information, ma'am. 
DINGELL: Thank you. And, I do thank you all. I've had a lot of desperate people, and you got multiple times more that, in the last few months. These are tough jobs and we want to make sure our Americans are safe and brought home safely. And, we probably don't say thank you enough to people who are trying to help our fellow Americans. 
CASTRO: Alright, thank you. 
DINGELL: I yield back, Mr. Chair. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Representative Dingell. And, we've got one more member who's going to be coming; of course, again, remember people are voting and coming back and forth. And so, it'll--it'll take about 5 minutes. Ted do you have any other questions you wanted to ask? I'll just check with the members that are here. 
If not, we can recess for five minutes, but just want to make sure there aren't any other questions that folks wanted to ask? Yeah-- 
UNKNOWN: I'm good. 
CASTRO: Okay, alright, we'll recess for about 5 minutes. I promise in about 20 minutes, you'll be outta here. Alright? Committee is in recess. 
(RECESS) 
CASTRO: Alright, the committee will come to order. And, now recognize, Ms. Omar. 
OMAR: Thank you, Chairman. Thank you so much for being here with us, Mr. Browlee-- Brownlee. My office heard from several people who had approved visas and were unable to travel due to the COVID pandemic. We also heard from people who were in the middle of an approval process, and those whose time limits expired during the pandemic. 
It doesn't seem fair to me that people might lose their visas or have to pay additional fees, through no fault of their own. Will the State Department automatically extend people's deadlines or visas, to accommodate them, when those things expired through no fault of their own? And-- and, can you guarantee that those--they won't be able to pay additional fees for this, for their cases? 
BROWNLEE: Ms. Omar, thanks very much for that question. This is an important issue. We understand that we were required back in March, to close down visa operations. I am very pleased to say that beginning six days ago, we sent instructions to the field, on how they could begin the individual posts around the world, can begin resuming visa, routine visa operations. 
We recognize that a great many people had paid for visa appointments and those visa appointments were canceled. We recognize a great many people had done their, for example, panel physician examinations; those--the results of those examinations, will have expired. We are formulating guidance to the field, right now, on how to deal with these various issues. 
We are very cognizant of the--the fairness issue here, that people paid in good faith for certain-- certain services and did not receive them. We also recognize that there were, time limitations on--on various other documents, that were not always within the control of the State Department. So, for example, some would be petitions that had been approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. We're looking at this closely right now. And, I hope to be able to give you a more fulsome answer, in the--in the near future. 
OMAR: Wonderful, we'll follow up-- 
BROWNLEE: Thank you. 
OMAR: Thank you so much. I know how anxiety-inducing it is for people who've waited for a long time to have gotten the opportunity and lose it. So, thank you. Ms. King, I just wanted to talk a little bit about repatriation. First of all, we all recognize how incredibly difficult and unprecedented this repatriation effort was. And, I'm amazed by the hard work and passion of the embassy staff and career officials. 
I know it wasn't easy. And, I know there will be a lot of lessons learned, to better prepare us for a true--truly global event like this one, in the future. How would you characterize the differences between the different countries, in terms of our communication with those countries, during this effort? And, are there countries where we didn't have adequate notice of their own plans to close airports and restrict flights? 
KING: Thank you very much. Thank you for your kind words for my team, first of all, very much appreciated. In terms of the repatriations, I think one of the main problems that we did encounter was lack of advanced notice from a number of countries. I certainly feel that if we were to do something differently in the future, we would have all of our embassies reach out immediately, to the host governments, to find out what their intentions were, in terms of closing borders. 
We were very much focused on where the epidemic was threatening U.S. citizen lives overseas, which was obviously China, in the beginning, and then moving into Europe. Obviously, where we saw a lot of issues with Americans unable to come home, was in Latin America, where a number of countries, for example, Peru did shut down the border, with very little notice. 
And then, we were in a position of having to request exceptions to bring in our rescue flights and our K-fund flights. We saw a similar phenomenon in Morocco; there we were very successfully able to get them to delay closure of their airport, while we were able to get in rescue flights. So, I don't think that there was anyone specific country. I think throughout the world, we saw this phenomenon. 
OMAR: I think one of the--one of my concerns involved cases in--in Venezuela. And, in this case, it looked like we were letting politics get in the way of doing our duty to protect U.S. citizens. And, I know oftentimes, you know, we have to prioritize the safety of our citizens and our ability to reunite them, with their families here at home. 
So I hope in the future as we learn from this, that we work to try to create that--that priority and substitute our ideology and politics, for the reality of what it means to have our citizens back home. Thank you. And, I yield back. 
CASTRO: Thank you, Ms. Omar and that concludes the member questioning. Again, I want to thank our witnesses from the State Department for your testimony. And, Ms. King, I think you made an important point at the end here, in your last answer, where you talked about some things that we might have done differently or approached differently, next time. 
I think all of us do not hope for anything like this pandemic or anything close to it, in the near future, or really, ever. However, it is important that at some point we take stock of lessons learned, and what we could do better, what we should do differently, next time. And, I hope that the State Department will work internally to put that kind of document together, but then at the right time also, share it with Congress. With that, I want to say thank you, and this meeting is adjourned. "

SPEAKERS:
REP. STENY H. HOYER (D-MD.), MAJORITY LEADER 
[*]UNKNOWN: Good morning, and thank you for joining Mr. Hoyer's pen and pad press conference. All reporter lines are currently muted. For this week, the usual pen and pad briefing rules still apply. Audio should not be used for radio or TV broadcasts. Mr. Hoyer will give brief opening remarks and then take questions. In order to ask a question, please press five on your keypad, and you will be placed into the queue. Once we start taking questions, we will let each reporter know when their line is open to ask a question. Once they've asked their question, their line will be muted again. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Hoyer to begin. 
HOYER: Thank you very much, Marielle. We have been involved in a crisis that has traumatized our country in COVID-19. Compounded--compounding that anger and that frustration has been the murder of George Floyd that has focused us on the safety of our citizens. This is a time, as I said, of crisis and trauma. Communities throughout the country, including my own, are grieving the loss of George Floyd, and many African-American men and women who have preceded him in a similar circumstance, losing their lives either by police conduct or citizens acting as vigilantes. 
Black lives matter. Today we're seeing great pain, anger, fear, excruciating frustration and the loss of lives without accountability. The killing must stop. It's time to act with unity and power of conviction. We have moral responsibility to listen and to ensure those who are grieving, who are in such pain, know that we see them, we hear them, and we are with them. In this challenging time, our nation needs real leadership that brings us together, not divides us. Instead, the president is stoking tensions. He is, in fact, in some ways a dictator of division. I am horrified that he addressed the nation last night and threatened to put down peaceful protests with military force, immediately after peaceful protesters were teargassed in front of the White House so he could hold a photo op, the act of an authoritarian, insensitive, non-empathetic leader. 
I'll be working closely with the Congressional Black Caucus on actions the House can take to stop this tragic loss of life, to strengthen accountability and to continue to reform our criminal justice system. We are in many ways seeing the legacy of slavery, dehumanization and segregation. And as we work to pass additional legislation, we will continue to urge the United States Senate to take up the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which would make lynching a federal hate crime and is long overdue. 
This is fact. Lynching is described as the extrajudicial killing by a mob or group of people without judicial sanction. We need to act. I believe we're going to act as soon. Now, when I talk about acting, our floor schedule, as I think some of you know, is designed to allow our committees, which have been unable to act because of their in--unwilling--inability--I was going to say unwillingness; that's not true--inability to come to Washington and to conduct committee hearings, to discuss and to act and to mark-up bills so that we have product to consider on the floor. 
As all of you know, for the last months we have been considering COVID-19 legislation and have in fact passed four major pieces of legislation, which have been signed by the president of the United States. They were bipartisan bills. We spent almost all of May working on COVID-19 legislation, which would continue to confront that and its consequences. The HEROES bill we passed just recently. That is now pending. Unfortunately, Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy have expressed no urgency to act. We would urge them to do so. We would urge them to come together with us as we have in the past and agree on the critically important resources that are made available to states and localities, municipalities, Indian tribes, to help local governments continue the fight against coronavirus. 
We passed legislation to help our healthcare professionals do additional testing, tracing, isolation, to make sure that we continue this battle and win it. And lastly, to individuals and small businesses we have dedicated a lot of money in HEROES to make sure that our economy does not tank even further than it has with 40 million people unemployed. So we will continue to hope that the Senate will come to the table to discuss further action, which we think is absolutely essential, and that we'll then be able to bring legislation to the floor. 
As soon as it is ready, we will convene the Congress and pass that legislation. Until then, the committees--and we have seven committees working this week to discuss legislation, the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Financial Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Budget Committee, the Veterans Affairs Committee, the House Administration Committee and the Appropriations Committee, so that you can see that there is much work being done by all the members to get the people's work done. 
We trust that that will be successful. We have the--coming up in the month of July and the end of June, the National Defense Authorization Act, an infrastructure package including reauthorization of the transportation provisions. We believe, by the way, that that bill will include many of the things that the task force on climate change is going to be making. WRDA reauthorization-- Water Resources Development Act, the legislation to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and the 12 appropriation bills. I can believe that we will pass all of those by the end of July. But right now our committees are working very hard to get that legislation prepared for consideration on the floor. 
Okay, that was a little long, I know, maybe a lot long. And let me turn it over to you, and I'll try to give quick answers to your questions so we can get to as many as possible. Marielle? 
UNKNOWN: Thank you, Mr. Hoyer. As a reminder, to ask a question please press five at any time. Our first question is from Andrew Kragie with Law360. Andrew, your line is un-muted, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Hi, Leader Hoyer. Thanks for doing this. I wanted to ask about specifically what legislative proposals you all might look at in response to George Floyd's death and the protests. There is discussion about qualified immunity for rolling back the (INAUDIBLE) that provides surplus military materials to police departments. What sort of proposals do you think might pass the House in the next (INAUDIBLE)? Thanks. 
HOYER: There are many, many proposals that have been filed by very many members, well over 40 pieces of legislation, maybe over 50 pieces of legislation. The Congressional Black Caucus, which has oftentimes been called the conscience of the Congress, I have talked to Karen Bass. I've talked to Jim Clyburn. I've talked to many other members of the CBC over the last four days. They are taking the lead. They had a meeting yesterday where they came together, and they are--want to be unified. They want to be directed at obtaining justice, undermining violence, and they want to be sure that the legislation they propose will be effective in stopping the murder of people who are either under arrest or are being pursued either by police or by private sector individuals. They want to make sure there is accountability for the loss of lives, which is unjustified. 
So that we will be following the CBC's initiatives. We'll be coming together in support of those initiatives, and I expect that to happen in the near future. One of the bills you introduced I'm sure is that consideration by the CBC as they put together a package, that way will do so in discussion with our--with the leadership and with other members of the caucus. If, in fact--let me conclude. If, in fact, legislation is proposed by the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus, and is considered by the committee and ready to go, we will then call all the members back to pass--consider and pass that legislation. I hope it will be bipartisan legislation. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Just a reminder, to ask a question please press five at any time. Our next question is from Heather Caygle with Politico. Heather, your line is open, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Hi, Leader Hoyer. Thank you for doing this again. 
HOYER: Hi, Heather. You bet. 
QUESTION: I wanted to follow up on that--one of the proposals mentioned is ending qualified immunity, and I know there is some concern among some members about the police unions that are either opposed to an idea like that, and I'm wondering if you personally support ending qualified immunity and what you think the chances are that something like that ends up in whatever package you guys put on the floor. 
HOYER: Let me just say to that, Heather, that clearly is one of the issues under consideration by the CBC and by the Judiciary Committee. There are bills on that, as you know. And again, without getting into the 40 or plus bills that are under consideration, although I will make an exception on the Jeffries language on using some kind of chokehold or device to shut off a person's ability to breathe, which is so dramatically the plaintive cry of Mr. Floyd, I can't breathe. I do support that bill, but rather than go into each one of the individual bills, I want to wait for the CBC to make its recommendation and for the Judiciary Committee to meet. 
But I do support bills to ensure transparency, to ensure accountability--transparency and what happened and reports of what happened and accountability. And this, of course, would be one of the issues regard--related to accountability. But I certainly expect to support a package of bills which we may put in one bill that gets at the pain that is being visited upon people without accountability. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Our next question is from Jonathan Nicholson with MarketWatch.com. Jonathan, your line is open, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Hello, Leader Hoyer. 
HOYER: Hi. 
QUESTION: This is not exactly a business related question, but it is something that does seem like it is important here. Given the visceral reaction from Democrats and from people, more than just Democrats, to the--to the tear gassing and the church incident yesterday, has there been any thought among the caucus or discussion to censure because of that incident? And if so, would that be something that would bring you guys back? 
HOYER: We've had no discussions of that as a caucus yet. That happened last night. It is certainly an action worthy and appropriate to censure and to criticize. It was a terrible act. It was an act indicating the total lack of understanding and empathy with the anger and frustration and cry for justice that was being put out, simply to facilitate a photo op, obviously designed for political purposes, not designed to bring the country together, not designed to explain the difference between the peaceful protesters and some who would undermine the message by the use of violence. 
Martin Luther King and so many others have spoken about violence and about how negative it is to use violence. The president stokes violence. He stokes anger. He stokes division. It was a terrible action for him to take. In my view, he did because he didn't like the news the night before where he was in a bunker and felt that he was cowering in that bunker. The Secret Service took him there for the safety of the president of the United States of America, and that was appropriate. But he has to show--had to show, which is why he took this action--that he was not cowering in a corner. However, what he was doing was cowering behind federal police that he ordered to disperse a crowd that was exercising its constitutional duty, and they did so in a way that created violence, not reduced violence. It was a terrible thing for him to do. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Our next question is from Chad Pergram with Fox News. Chad, your line is open, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Thank you, Marielle. Good morning, Mr. Hoyer. Thank you for doing this, as always. My question, to dovetail a little bit on what Jonathan just asked then, what sort of action should Congress take? I mean maybe not formally sanctioning the president. We've seen resolutions of disapproval, but I guess what I'm getting into is should there be an investigation or committees looking at how the military could or would be used under posse comitatus? What about what was the direction to the Park Service or the Secret Service gassing persons assembled by the park? What's the investigative part of this? What should committees be doing as they look at the incident last night? 
HOYER: Well, again, the incident happened last night, Chad, so there hasn't been a lot of discussion this morning yet, and we're going to have a leadership conference call or conference call coming up today. I know that will be one of the items of discussion, and I would expect the appropriate committees to look at this, whether it's Judiciary, Homeland Security, Government Oversight, all of the facts that you just mentioned, we ought to deduce. 
But very frankly, this president does on a regular, almost daily basis things that I think deserve seeing the light of day in terms of A, they are either untruthful, hateful, divisive. So from that standpoint I would hope that the committees would look at what directions he gave. And when you talk about the military, his actions to militarize this issue and then criticizing the governors for not being tougher, I suppose that means more violence has not been perpetrated, and governors, perhaps not every one of them are trying to resolve and focus on the injustices that the demonstrators are talking about and are doing so properly and consistent with our Constitution and the culture of our country so that the perpetrators of violence are undermining that message, as is the president. 
But I think you're right; the committees ought to be looking at all of those aspects. Whether or not we want to have a resolution of censure, we haven't discussed. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Our next question is from Michael McAuliff with the New York Daily News. Michael, your line is open, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Thanks, Leader Hoyer. It's great that you're doing this. Related to all this protest and just a little bit more under the radar because it tends to focus on reporters is that there have been more than 100 incidents, mostly captured on video, of police directly targeting reporters, including in that incident last night; Australia got to see one of their reporters beaten in the face by federal police. So I'm wondering if Congress is or will consider anything that goes at protecting the press and the First Amendment. 
HOYER: Michael, I think it's a great question. I didn't mention the press in my previous answer in terms of what ought to be investigated, but to the extent that law enforcement officers, sworn to uphold the law, violate the law, including prohibiting reporters from reporting what actually is being taken, we know that transparency is the antiseptic for bad criminal violent behavior. Calls you back to Birmingham. I don't know how old all of you are, but Birmingham I've been to the square where children were confronted by dogs, which apparently was a reference that the president made, inappropriately, that we certainly ought to make sure that these incidents and the press in particular can be allowed to do their work and to present what is happening because if people do not know what is happening, if their moral outrage is not pricked, if you will, then action may not occur. 
But the CBC has made it very clear, and we're making it very clear, action must happen legislatively, vociferously, speaking out, acting in a positive, constructive way in opposition to the loss of life that has been occurring far too frequently, clearly related to the color of the person's skin. It is unacceptable in America. Unfortunately, as I said earlier, in many ways is the legacy of slavery and segregation and prejudice and bigotry that we see. And it must stop. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Our next question is from Lisa Mascaro with the AP News (INAUDIBLE). Your line is open, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Hi, thanks for doing this. Hi. Thanks so much, Leader Hoyer, for doing this, as always. A lot of the questions have been answered, but I did want to just ask you on timing, are you saying then that you expect the House would be called back sooner than the June 30 to vote on some of this package coming from the CBC or other bills in response to--to the situation with the--the, you know, police protests and the violence? 
HOYER: Lisa, what I have said is A, we're going to take the lead of the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus on this, which as I said, we often refer to as the conscience of the Congress, number one. Number two, I expect recommendations to be made in the near term, and when a bill is ready, assuming we have hearings on it and it goes through committee and it is reported out by committee. I would expect us to come back, if that's before June 30. And I want to reiterate, understand that members, some members are in Washington now. I don't know how many. But there are seven committees that are meeting this week to consider legislation. So it's--members are engaged in legislative work, albeit in many cases they're teleworking if you can make that analogy. 
But I do expect this is a matter of great urgency, and we expect to act as soon as possible on legislation which would seek to stop, make transparent change policies so that these incidents, which are happening on a regular basis, do not keep occurring. We can't have this in America. So the answer to your question is yes, if legislation is ready, we'll bring members back. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Our last question is from Jim Rowley with Bloomberg, and then Mr. Hoyer will conclude today's pen and pad. Jim, your line is open, and you may ask your question. 
QUESTION: Mr. Hoyer, are you concerned that this lawsuit that's been filed by Republicans will put a chilling effect on bipartisan cooperation going forward on anything, in particular the economic stimulus or I guess this police (INAUDIBLE) 
HOYER: Jim, I hope not. But let me give you an example. The FISA legislation that we considered last week, the president said he was going to veto it, and he urged all Republicans to vote no. Now that was a bill, as I said, where everybody had to vote their conscience and their conviction on the Constitution. And as has always happened with that bill, it's been a bipartisan vote to pass it, and it passed with over two thirds vote through the House and with 80 senators in the Senate. 
However, the Republicans' articulation of everybody was going to vote no left us the option of okay, we'll send it to a conference committee. The question was, were there going to be Republicans voting for it? 70-plus Republicans did, in fact, vote for it in opposition to the president's direction, and that's what it was, a direction. So I believe we can get to bipartisan results, even in the context of the lawsuit, which is what you asked because subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit--and I talked to some Republicans who thought that the president's directive to vote no was absolutely wrong, and I think they would have voted yes on FISA. 
Whether we would have had sufficient numbers, we don't know. But in any event, the fact that they voted was I think a--for sending the bill to conference as we urged them to do, shows that there are a significant number of Republicans who are willing, hopefully in the future, to not vote their--either based upon their suit against Congress on proxy voting, which I think has no merit and will be rejected by the courts, but also will vote, hopefully, against the president's ill-advised recommendations on legislation of importance to the security and well-being of our country. So Jim, am I concerned? Yes. Do I believe that it's going to preclude them from working with us either on COVID-19 or other legislation? I think hopefully the answer to that is no. 
All right, folks. Thank you for being with me today. This is a serious and troubling and challenging time, as I said at the beginning of this press conference, or pen and pad, in our country. COVID-19 is something that nobody has considered, has--has experienced before. Unfortunately, the tragedy of George Floyd we have seen before, and I think notwithstanding the challenge of COVID-19, we--which by the way has also brought to light the stark disparity in health outcomes for black Americans, as well as other minority Americans and the majority population. 
So not only is the equality in law enforcement being questioned, but the equality in so many other aspects of our society are properly being questioned. And we need to examine ourselves, our country. Tocqueville said that the strength of America was not that it was perfect, but it was always striving to make it more perfect, a more perfect union. And that certainly is a message that we need to get loud and clear and pursue. Thank you very much. "

[*]GRAHAM: Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for attending the hearing. And I'm sure we'll have more come in, throughout the morning. 
We've got four witnesses: Mr. Craig Carpenito, is that right? Okay good, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey; Bill Hughes, Associate Deputy Attorney General; Calvin Shivers, Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division, FBI; Michael D'Ambrosio, Assistant Director of the Office of Investigations, United States Secret Service. 
So, we talked about this before, fraud related to the CARES Act, scams out there against seniors, selling masks that don't work, trying to play on peoples' fears. Unfortunately, when you try to do some good in the country, people take advantage of it. 
And we're going to hear from our folks, today, about what's going on out there and some ideas about how to make sure it stops, if we can. 
Phase IV will be coming. There's a need, in my view, for Phase IV. So, I'd like to learn as much as we can about the Paycheck Protection Program, the economic impact for individuals and supplemental unemployment benefits, how those programs are, sometimes, being abused. And generally, about what people are doing out there to scam Americans, particularly, our seniors. And that's the purpose of the hearing. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Senator Feinstein. 
FEINSTEIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I'll put my statement in the record, so you can proceed. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Anything from anybody? Okay. Let's start with Mr. Hughes. 
HUGHES: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you, today, with several of my colleagues, to discuss the federal law enforcement efforts to deter, detect and prosecute those who violate federal law, by exploiting the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused. 
Before I focus on the topic of the day, I want to take a moment to address the tragic killing of George Floyd. As Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosen have previously said, the video images of the police conduct in this instance are incredibly disturbing. 
As the Attorney General previously announced, the Department is conducting a parallel and independent investigation into this incident, in collaboration with the FBI, to determine whether federal civil rights laws were violated. 
We intend to conduct that investigation, as swiftly as possible, and are not sparing any resources. We know that George Floyd's death was not the first of its kind and it exposes concerns that reach far beyond this specific incident. 
The outrage that Mr. Floyd's death has triggered is real, legitimate and deeply rooted. While the vast majority of police officers do their job honorably and in accordance with the law, we see instances like this one that erode confidence in the American criminal justice system. 
America takes great pride in the rule of law being a bedrock principle and, as the nation's leading federal law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice is committed to doing its part to seek justice for Mr. Floyd and his loved ones and to secure the confidence of all Americans in law enforcement. 
I know these issues are important to you. They are important to us. We welcome the opportunity to have discussions on the subject, in the days ahead. But for today, for this hearing, our subject is the pandemic, the related economic disruption and those that wish to exploit others for their own gain, during tremendously challenging times. 
The Attorney General has made clear that, notwithstanding, the operational challenges the pandemic presents, it is critical that the Department is vigilant in detecting, investigating and prosecuting wrong doing, relating to the crisis. 
This has become a high priority for us. Since the early days of the pandemic, we have been receiving reports of individuals and businesses using the crisis as an opportunity to exploit, both Americans and government programs, designed to assist Americans that have been hard hit. 
Leveraging the public's concern about the pandemic, fraudsters utilized many schemes to separate Americans from the money in their bank accounts, from their government benefits and from there personally identifiable information. 
Other fraudsters and unscrupulous opportunists have gotten into the personal protective equipment trade, looking to defraud and price gouge health providers, first responders and other essential workers, who have no choice but to pay astronomical prices for protective equipment that their health depends on. 
We're also seeing schemes that target taxpayer backed relief programs that provide Americans and American businesses financial help, as they weather a disrupted economy. 
In particular, fraudsters are targeting the Payroll Protection Program, the Economic Impact Payment Program and its state unemployment benefit programs. 
The pandemic has also changed the cyber threat landscape. Child predators on the Internet see widespread closing of schools, stay-at-home orders and the reliance on Internet platforms, as the primary means of communication, as an opportunity to prey on children. 
Cyber criminals also see the widespread work from home posture of many American businesses, as an opportunity to attack and infiltrate business computer networks, to disable systems, or steal or hold hostage, valuable data. 
As I'm sure you will agree, it is reprehensible that anyone would use this crisis as an opportunity to profit, at another person's expense or, otherwise, prey on the public. 
The Department of Justice will not tolerate it. And our resolve is demonstrated by our efforts to coordinate a cross Department offices and components to collaborate with other government agencies and to engage with industry and the public. 
We are already bringing cases to hold fraudsters accountable and to disrupt their schemes. And we will be doing so, for the foreseeable future. 
I thank you, again, for the invitation and I look forward to your questions. 
CARPENITO: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. I am Craig Carpenito, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. I was appointed by Attorney General Barr to lead the Department's Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force. 
We are grateful for the privilege of appearing before you, today, to discuss the Department's efforts to detect and prosecute those who, for their personal financial gain, seek to exploit the COVID 19 pandemic and the economic dislocation it has caused. 
The Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General our leading those efforts and we are honored to help them in that vital task. 
We want to thank the committee for its attention to these issues and to the good work at the Department of Justice to protect the safety and security of our nation, during this unprecedented crisis. 
Before I answer your questions, today, about price gouging, hoarding and COVID 19 fraud, however, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the senseless and tragic death of George Floyd, at the hands of the Minneapolis police. 
I am proud of the people of New Jersey, who have raised their voices in peaceful protest, seeking justice and reform in the name of Mr. Floyd and the other victims, like him. 
I hear and appreciate their call for change. In New Jersey, we have witnessed productive community and law enforcement partnerships in cities like Newark and Camden. 
These partnerships have lowered crime and restored trust. While we in New Jersey are proud of these efforts, we recognize that we must and we will do more. 
Now, let me turn to the reason I'm here, today. 
We've seen a broad range of illegal conduct, throughout the country, in these past few months. Our strategies and responses have evolved to meet new challenges, as they arise. But our core philosophy has not. The Department will investigate and prosecute those who treat--seek to treat COVID 19, as an opportunity to defraud the public and the government. 
The Department has received many reports of individuals and businesses, using the crisis to seek windfall profits, at the expense of public safety and the health and welfare of the American people. These reports range from the sale of fake cures of COVID 19, online, to hoarding and price gouging of critical medical supplies, to defrauding the CARES Act economic programs. 
The Department is, aggressively, investigating those reports and has already commenced prosecutions. 
The Department's attorneys work side by side with our partners at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret Service, as well as other federal, state and local agency partners. 
Make no mistake, the fight against COVID 19 is a fight to save precious lives, every day. Our medical professionals and first responders put their own lives at risk to stand between the virus and each of us. The personal protective equipment that they wear is the only shield they have to protect themselves, as they bravely go face to face with the virus, each day. 
It helps ensure our heroes do not fall victim to the disease. It also helps ensure that they do not bring it home to their families and their broader communities. 
Hoarding and price gouging, in particular, have inhibited front line healthcare professionals, essential workers and the public from acquiring the supplies the need to protect themselves from contracting the virus. Hospitals, first responders and retail consumers have been targeted by individuals who view the scarcity of critical medical materials, as a path to get rich quick. 
This conduct has disrupted our supply chains and markets and jeopardized the safety of our communities. In response, Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosen, assembled the Departments hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force to combat and prevent hoarding and price gouging. 
The task force is comprised of over 100 experienced federal prosecutors, throughout the nation's 93 U.S. Attorneys offices and Department components, here in Washington. 
The task force's primary mission is to identify, investigate and prosecute illegal hoarding and price gouging of crucial medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, such as face masks, that are essential to preventing the spread of the virus. 
We do so in the larger context of the current public health crisis. The decision the Department makes to open investigations, or to bring charges, are intended to help the public health response. Accordingly, the task force is focusing on profiteering, especially, by market participants, who sell scarce materials for excessive prices that far exceed their reasonable cost. 
The task force also is investigating counterfeit, misbranded and defective medical supplies, imported into the U.S., from abroad. These flawed products are entering our stream of commerce and creating safety hazards. We will use all of our tools at our disposal to identify these products and those who transaction them here and abroad and hold them accountable. 
The Department's efforts are ongoing but they have already yielded substantial results. We've brought several federal criminal cases, across the country, alleging price gouging, fraud, misbranding and other charges. 
Just last week, the task force commenced the Department's first criminal prosecution against a foreign manufacturer for sending defective and misbranded N95 respirator masks into the United States, during the pandemic. Instead of protecting our medical professionals, these materials would have, silently, put them in harm's way. 
We've also seized hoarded materials and worked with agents and partners to distribute them to those on the front lines to fight COVID 19. 
Thank you, again, for inviting us to address these important topics and I look forward to answering your questions. 
GRAHAM: Mr. Shivers. 
SHIVERS: Good morning, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and members of the committee. 
My name is Calvin Shivers and I'm the Assistant Director of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division. 
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, today, to discuss the FBI's response to COVID 19 related fraud. 
As head of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division, I oversee the FBI's financial crimes and fraud against the government programs. In my role as the Assistant Director of the Criminal Division, I also oversee civil rights, color of law and hate crime investigations. 
I believe it's important that I take a moment to address the recent events, which have grabbed our nation's attention, before I focus on the issues, surrounding today's hearing. 
I, along with my colleagues at the FBI, offer our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd. The FBI civil rights program has a long and proud history of protecting the rights of the American people. 
As the primary federal agency responsible for civil rights investigations, we at the FBI are committed to utilizing our full set of investigative and intelligence capabilities to address violations of federal civil rights laws. 
In pursuit of justice, we are conducting a thorough investigation into the actions that led to George Floyd's death. The FBI recognizes the rights of citizens to exercise their first amendment rights and we will continue to work to protect our citizens and their ability to exercise those rights, free of violence. 
Now, I will shift back to the topic at hand. 
These are unprecedented times for most Americans. Due to COVID 19, people are, understandably, worried about their health and their livelihood. Although we are coming together in various communities and throughout the country, unfortunately, there are individuals who seek to exploit our anxieties and fears, by selling fake COVID 19 cures, or vaccines. 
They are also peddling fraudulent investment opportunities in companies, purportedly, working to develop cures and vaccines for COVID 19. These were some of the earliest COVID 19 fraud schemes the FBI identified. 
When the attorney general issued a memorandum on March 16 of this year, directing U.S. attorneys to prioritize COVID 19 related fraud investigations and prosecutions, the FBI was ready. 
Within days, all 56 FBI field offices began working a wide range of investigations, related to COVID 19 fraud schemes. 
As we began our investigations, we saw a number of different criminal schemes. We saw subjects hoarding personal protective equipment, or PPE, and attempting to sell it at exorbitant prices. We also saw people selling counterfeit, or substandard PPE. 
The FBI worked closely with the Department of Justice and other law enforcement partners to conduct price gouging investigations, or seize counterfeit PPE. 
The CARES Act was designed to provide fast and direct economic assistance to families, American workers and small businesses. However, there are individuals who seek to steal money from the people the CARES Act was designed to help. 
With the passage of the CARES Act, we began to see fraudsters shift their efforts towards exploiting the various programs created to relieve the severe economic effects of COVID 19. 
To effectively target this growing threat, the FBI formed a Payroll Protection Program Fraud Working Group, in coordination with the Department of Justice's fraud section and the Small Business Administration's Office of Inspector General. Through this effort, 116 investigations have been initiated and over $126 million in potential fraud has been identified. 
We're also beginning to see healthcare fraud. We are seeing fraudulent billing for services not received, charges for unnecessary procedures and fraud related to telemedicine. 
In addition to fraud schemes, we are seeing crimes targeting our children. School closures have increased the presence of children, online. In addition, social distancing restrictions and the isolation of children at home may afford terminal actors with an opportunity to sexually exploit vulnerable children. 
We are, proactively, countering this threat, through active investigations. We're also working to educate the public, regarding the warning signs and the danger of online sexual exploitation. 
Although these threats are numerous and evolving rapidly, the FBI has and will continue to be vigilant in addressing these crimes and holding the individuals who commit these crimes, accountable. 
We rely, heavily, on public education and awareness. When the general public is made aware of fraudulent schemes and criminal activity, they are better situated to report them. For that reason, I am incredibly appreciative of the opportunity to speak with you, today. 
I thank you, Chairman Graham, and Ranking Member Feinstein, for bring attention to these issues and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you. 
D'AMBROSIO: Thank you, Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein and distinguished members of this committee. 
Before I begin, like my colleagues, I'd like to express my deep sadness and frustration with the tragic events of recent weeks. 
Having served in government for nearly 29 years, nothing troubles me more than police misconduct. It severely erodes the essential trust necessary for law enforcement to, effectively, protect and serve our communities. 
Law enforcement must be held to the highest standard. Racism and discrimination in any form is totally unacceptable. 
The Secret Service is committed and, indeed, oath bound, to ensuring that all Americans are afforded their constitutional rights to equal treatment, under the law, and to freedom of speech and assembly. 
Those rights are unalienable and no duty is higher for a law enforcement officer then to protect them. 
Returning to the subject of this hearing. Thank you all for inviting me to speak about the current wave of COVID 19 related crime and the work of the United States Secret Service to counter it. 
As early as February of this year, the Secret Service identified individuals and groups, seeking to exploit the pandemic for illicit profit. 
We quickly took action to build the capacity and strategy necessary to combat what we anticipated would be a surge of criminal activity. 
Major disasters have long invited fraud. From the terrorist attacks on 9/11, to hurricanes Katrina and Maria and, indeed, well before, criminals throughout history have used public emergencies, as opportunities to defraud the public. 
However, the fraud associated with the current COVID 19 pandemic presents a scale and scope of risk we have not seen, before. Enabled by the Internet, criminals all over the world are defrauding anxious citizens, distressed businesses and government stimulus programs, alike. 
Since we released our first alert on March 4, we observed the significant proliferation of criminal schemes. In particular, we have seen a surge in crimes targeting various economic relief programs, such as those provided by the CARES Act. Countering this fraud has become a core focus of investigative work and I expect our investigative efforts will continue, for years. 
The Secret Service, in addition to our protective mission, is responsible for the investigation of criminal violations of U.S. law, pertaining to the U.S. financial system. 
As the Assistant Director of the Office of Investigations, I lead the, over 160 field officers of the Secret Service, which includes our network of electronic and financial crimes task forces, which conduct specialized investigations of cyber and financial crimes. 
The immediate investigative focus of the Secret Service is to disrupt and deter criminal activity that could hinder an effective response to the pandemic, by assisting organizations at risk of fraud and working to recover any funds stolen from Americans. 
Longer term, we will ensure that those who have criminally exploited this crisis are arrested and, successfully, prosecuted. 
I am pleased to report that the Secret Service has already seen tremendous success emerge from our investigative efforts, to date. We have initiated over 100 criminal investigations and prevented, approximately, $1 billion in fraud losses. 
Among other law enforcement actions, the Secret Service has, successfully, disrupted hundreds of online COVID 19 related scams, halted the illicit sale of stolen COVID 19 test kits online and is leading a nationwide effort to counter a vast, international scheme to defraud U.S. state unemployment systems. 
We have also released regular threat intelligence and alerts to provide industry, consumers and our law enforcement partners with the best practices to defend themselves from the latest criminal threats. However, we are not achieving these results by ourselves. We can credit much of our success to the close partnerships we have built, with a range of government and industry partners. 
In particular, we are working closely with the various agencies of the Department of Treasury, with the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency and Homeland Security investigations, as well as various offices of the inspector general, particularly, from the Department of Labor and Small Business Administration. And of course, my colleagues to the right, within the Department of Justice, their COVID 19 Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have all been essential partners. 
I am committed to ensuring the Secret Service is doing our part, on behalf of the American people, to counter criminal activity exploiting this pandemic. I look forward to answering your questions on how we can work together to address this threat. 
Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Well, thank you all. I'll start with the Secret Service. Can you give me some examples of how people are taking advantage of the Paycheck Protection Program? 
D'AMBROSIO: We primarily, right now, our focus on the unemployment-- 
GRAHAM: --Okay, I'm sorry. Let's, tell me about unemployment. 
D'AMBROSIO: So, right now, it's mainly stolen identity, theft investigation in which criminals are utilizing stolen PII, things that they have acquired on, whether it be the dark web, whether it be network intrusions. And they are using that stolen information to apply for Social Security benefits and probably across, right now, about 29 states, across the country that we have seen. 
It's not a very complex fraud. It's the availability of PII out in public that allows for this to occur. 
GRAHAM: Got you. Is there anything this committee can do to help you in this endeavor? Do you have all the tools you need in current law? 
D'AMBROSIO: We have the tools, right now, that we need for this particular-- 
GRAHAM: --Do you have the resources? 
D'AMBROSIO: We have the resources with the partnerships that we created, whether it be the Department of Labor, as well as-- 
GRAHAM: Okay, the answer is yes, right? Okay. 
D'AMBROSIO: The answer is yes. 
GRAHAM: Mr. Shivers, I appreciate what you all are doing at the FBI. When it comes to consumer fraud, what are you seeing most of? 
SHIVERS: (OFF MIC) 
GRAHAM: Your mic, please. Thank you. 
SHIVERS: So, as I mentioned in my opening, on the consumer fraud, initially, private citizens were targeted through a number of schemes. Many of those schemes included offers to sell counterfeit COVID-19 cures, or vaccines. And as I mentioned in the opening, also, investment opportunities. 
And so, what we see is a wide range of citizens being targeted, through a number of means-- 
GRAHAM: --Is that problem getting better, or worse, or is it about the same? 
SHIVERS: It's continuing--I think, COVID-19, obviously, has shined a light on an opportunity for criminals to take advantage of a specific type of scheme. 
And so, what we see is a number of ways that they're reaching individuals, through unsolicited phone calls, or through unsolicited emails. So, there's a wide range. 
And what we ask the public to do is to make reports to IC3.gov. and that gives us greater visibility on the nature of threats and the number of threats. 
GRAHAM: Is there anything the committee can do? Do you have the tools you need to deal with the problem? 
SHIVERS: We do, sir. 
GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. Mr. Carpenito, is that right? 
CARPENITO: Carpenito, sir. 
GRAHAM: Carpenito, I'm sorry. Tell us about the fraudulent sales going on out there. What's going on, in terms of overseas activity? 
CARPENITO: So, what we're seeing, sir, with regards to hoarding and price gouging is the trends have indicated to us that, initially, what we had was fraud relating to a spike in the prices of the materials. 
In this country we, essentially, had a supply chain that consisted of six major suppliers of these masks, the N95 mask, three-ply mask, just like these that were commoditized products that were sold at, relatively, cheap prices, pennies, to our first responders and our medical professionals. They were easy to obtain and they were something that, I think, were taken for granted, as part of our system. 
What happened was, just like any scenario we've seen in our country's history where we have a national crisis, there's always going to be that dark underbelly that rises to the top and tries to profit, illicitly, from the fears of folks that are most impacted by the pandemic. 
And what happened here was, a bunch of interlopers in the market came in, obtained mass quantities of these materials and held on to them, raised the prices and price gouged. These masks went from being $0.50, $0.60 apiece, to selling for $7.00, $8,00, as high as $25.00, in some cases. 
What we've done is we've gotten the word out about the invocation of the Defense Production Act, the fact that it makes it illegal to do that, to price gouge. And we've opened up a series of investigations. 
So, we've been getting out there to try and find any stockpiles, if they exist and get that material back into the supply chain-- 
GRAHAM: --Do you have the tools you need to continue down this path? 
CARPENITO: We do, sir. The Defense Production Act gives us the ability to bring this conduct to light and to remedy it. 
GRAHAM: Mr. Shivers, very quickly, can you tell us a little bit about the Paycheck Protection Program? What kind of problems have you seen there? 
SHIVERS: Yes, what we've seen are fraudulent filings from individuals who are, either exaggerating the number of employees that they may have, within their business, or perhaps, they don't have any employees. 
And so, what they're doing is taking advantage of-- 
GRAHAM: --How do you find out about these cases? 
SHIVERS: It's a wide range. Part of it is outreach that the FBI conducts with the banking sector and with the private sector. And one of the things that we do is we formed relationships with financial institutions and provided them with training, having an idea of what to look for, some of the fraud indicators. 
So, part of it's a relationship. The other part of that relationship is with the Small Business Administration's Office of Inspector General. And so, through coordination with SBAs, OIG, we're also receiving information that helps us open cases. 
GRAHAM: Okay, Mr. Hughes, finally, I'm sorry to go over here. We're looking at a Phase IV and I'm sure we'll do one. If you could get back to the committee, you don't have to do it now in 30 seconds, but if there's anything you don't' have, in terms of being able to deal with this, let us know. 
If you need more resources, let us know. But generally speaking, how do we stand? Do you have the resources and tools necessary to oversee these programs, at this point in time? 
HUGHES: I think the answer is, yes. And you know, Chairman Graham, we really appreciate the committee's support. There are a number of legislative proposals that have been in discussion, one of which is increasing deterrence by increasing sentencing guidelines for fraud committed, during national emergencies. 
We look forward to continuing to discuss that proposal-- 
GRAHAM: Well, you get us a list of things you think would help. 
Senator Feinstein. 
FEINSTEIN: In my 26 years on this committee, Mr. Chairman, I've never seen anything quite like this. If I understand it, the Federal Trade Commission has reported that, as of June 7, consumers have lost nearly $48 million, due to coronavirus related fraud. 
And this includes scam offers for vaccines, test kits, cures, air filters that were falsely advertised. That there's been unacceptable price gouging on basic items, like hand sanitizer, sophisticated schemes targeting state governments. 
I understand, in Washington state, for example, criminals used stolen personal information to file fraudulent unemployment claims. And it goes on and on. And then, you have the Nigerian fraud ring, known as Scattered Canary, that's used personal information, likely, obtained through prior consumer data breaches to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars. 
And it's bizarre. Why is this so unique to have all of this? What is there in this program that attracts this kind of fraud effort? 
HUGHES: Thank you, Senator, for your question. I think there's two things going on, here. One, you have a pandemic, which is rightfully a major concern and, basically, every American's life. There's a lot unknown, still, about COVID 19. 
And you also have an economic disruption, which, rightfully, sparked serious response, from the federal government, in the way of economic relief. 
And so, those two events, simultaneously, created a situation where you have many consumers out there, who are anxious about their own health. 
FEINSTEIN: Yeah, but you are so broad-based in your comments. Nothing is specific. Let me ask you, specific. Apparently, Washington state was able to recover the $300 million that it had paid for fraudulent claims, related to one scheme. 
What other big fraud cases are out there? And what is being done to stop it? 
HUGHES: We're doing several things. First, is that we have hundreds of investigations open, all over the Department of Justice. We're working every single law enforcement agency in the executive branch. 
We are pursuing separate courses, investigations, monitoring trends about each, criminal conduct regarding each one of these programs. And some of the case-- 
FEINSTEIN: Well, talk to me for a minute about Scattered Canary, this Nigerian fraud ring. 
HUGHES: So, Senator, I'm unable to discuss the specifics of any particular matter, or any particular potential target. What I will say is that, especially with respect to unemployment benefits fraud, there is a strong indication that some of the perpetrators are overseas entities, or organizations and that they are using money mules and other standard mechanisms to transfer money outside of the country. 
FEINSTEIN: Is this the Nigerian fraud ring? Is Scattered Canary a Nigerian fraud ring? 
HUGHES: So, Senator, I'm not, personally, knowledgeable, as to that organization. I'm happy to take-- 
GRAHAM: Does anybody know about this? 
D'AMBROSIO: Yes, Senator 
GRAHAM: Well, tell us about it. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you. 
D'AMBROSIO: There has been some reporting on the Scattered Canary being Nigerian. But I have no specific information to confirm those particular activities. 
FEINSTEIN: Could you tell us what you know? 
D'AMBROSIO: What I do know is that the fraud again is, as you stated, Senator, is essentially stolen PII that is out already in public, or whether it's, particularly, bought off the dark web for these particular crimes. And then, they are utilized to file fraudulent unemployment claims. 
And that money has been seen transiting through money mules, as has been already said. 
FEINSTEIN: Well, have these consumer data breaches fraudulently obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment benefits from state governments? Could you gentlemen answer the question, yes or no? 
D'AMBROSIO: I can't answer as to the exact amount, Senator, that's been claimed. I can tell you that the Secret Service, based on an alert that we published in late May, the information that we received back from working with over 100 financial institutions that mitigated the loss of about $500 million in payments. 
And so, that's anecdotal information that we received from the financial institutions. 
FEINSTEIN: So, how did Washington state recover the $300 million that it had paid in fraudulent claims, related to one of these schemes? Can anybody answer that question? 
HUGHES: Senator, I don't think we have that information at our fingertips. We can take it back and discuss with our colleagues. 
FEINSTEIN: Because you know, I've been here for a while. And Mr. Chairman, I've never seen anything like it. It's a program riddled with fraud. 
GRAHAM: Here's what I believe. If you put $3 trillion out there, people will take advantage of it. And we had to do it. And I share your frustration. It's been a lot of generalities, here. We'd like to know, what can we do, what's going on, who's doing it, how widespread is it. 
FEINSTEIN: That's right. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. 
FEINSTEIN: And could any of you gentlemen summarize what is going on and what it's going to take to stop it? 
HUGHES: Senator, that's an incredibly broad question. If you're talking just about CARES Act fraud, there is targeting the Payroll Protection Program by fraudsters, misrepresenting their small business, or the characteristics of their small business, or misrepresenting that there's a small business, at all. 
There are fraudsters who are using PII that they've accumulated, or bought on the Internet to apply for unemployment benefit programs that are state-sponsored. And there are a number of schemes, relating to economic impact payments, again, relying on PII to apply for these payments, or to defraud recipients of those payments to hand those over to the fraudsters. 
FEINSTEIN: Well, that me ask you this. The FTC reported that, as of June 7, consumers have lost nearly $48 million, due to coronavirus related fraud. And that includes scams for vaccines, test kits, miracle cures, air filters that were falsely advertised as capable of removing COVID 19 from the air in peoples' homes. 
So, there are all these fraudulent business practices out there, apparently. What is being done to stop them, to arrest and convict? 
HUGHES: I think we're, vigorously, investigating and using the tools that we have, both criminal and civil. When you bring a prosecution, you have forfeiture powers, should there be a guilty plea, or a verdict at trial of guilty. 
On the civil side, you have a number of different statutes, which allows you to make the fraudster forfeit his ill-gotten gains. In order to disrupt, we have a statute that allows us to seek a TRO, a preliminary injunction and, ultimately, an injunction. That is a quicker solution to stopping some of these schemes, many of which involve an online website, which is the major marketing mechanism of some of these fraudsters. 
FEINSTEIN: The information I have before me, I've never had before me, in any program in 26 years. And I wonder if it's worth continuing. 
How do you stop this fraud? 
CARPENITO: So, Senator, maybe I can help respond by what the Department of Justice has done to try and police these programs. 
First, I can tell you-- 
FEINSTEIN: -- Could you indicate to us, how many cases have been brought, convictions sought and convictions obtained? 
CARPENITO: What I can tell you is, we've received thousands of referrals, through the network of task forces that have been put up. 
Right away, right when the pandemic came to be, Attorney General Barr, I think, showed very swift leadership in forming two task forces, specific to COVID 19. One, relating to general fraud relating to COVID 19. The other, my task force, relating to the hoarding and price gouging, which was meant to stand up very quickly to try and get the valuable PPE to the individuals who needed it, as quickly as possible. 
Those programs each have, approximately, 100 prosecutors in each of them that are focusing on the COVID related crime. It takes some time to work a white-collar case and it has to be done, covertly, because we don't want to do anything to disrupt the network of criminals, before we can get a hold of where the money is, we can trace everything, especially, for overseas cases. 
So, we're working them, expeditiously. I can tell you, there are hundreds of investigations in my task force, alone, and thousands, nationally, related to COVID fraud, in general. 
We've also formed partnerships with our state attorney generals to share information. Sharing information in white-collar cases like this is critical to being able to get to the money. Because at the end of the day, that's what this is about. We want to prevent individuals from sending payments, or from having their bank accounts pillaged. 
We want to prevent government programs from the same. And where it's already happened, we need to cooperate with law enforcement to work with financial institutions to trace those transactions. 
And I know it can be frustrating, at times, that we can't get into specifics. But one of the reasons we can't is our, you know, our network operates, you know, through the ability to stay covert and find these resources, this money, before we pounce and we go into court and go public on it. We have to have everything locked down, if we're going to be successful. 
GRAHAM: Senator Feinstein, we'll have a round two. But I think Senator Grassley, you're next, sir. 
GRASSLEY: Thank you. I've heard, thus far, that you've got the resources you need and you've got the tools that you need. I hope that that's right. Time will tell. If that's true, that's very nice. 
I want to start out with a compliment to the Justice Department and some things that are related to the pandemic and some things that might not be related. But I want to complement the people that have filed price fixing suits against Pilgrim Pride and Claxton Poultry because I've always felt there isn't enough competition in agricultural industry. 
And also, last week, the Department of Justice announced that it had issued what they referred to as civil investigative demands to the nation's four largest meatpackers. And those four largest ones have about 80 percent of all the packing industry and slaughter industry in the country, as a whole. And there's plenty of reason to believe that there might not be things right there, when a month ago, the price of beef to the farmer went down about 60 percent. The price to the consumer went up about 25 percent. 
I sent a letter on March 31 to the secretary, or to General Barr. And I've done that, over a period of 20 years, under both Republican and Democrat administrations, hardly getting any results, whatsoever. So, you can imagine how surprised I am but thankful for this administration taking those moves to make sure that the marketplace is working in that industry because farmers are very depressed by some of the things that are happening in that industry. 
So, let me go to questions. 
On April 7, Senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the Attorney General Barr, expressing our serious concern about price gouging and hoarding of essential medical supplies. We asked for information from the Department's implementation and enforcement of the president's executive order. We've not received a response from the Justice Department, so that I hope we'll get it soon. 
It's important that Congress have this data, as we figure out how to best address the problems we face. 
We appreciate when agencies are quick to share information with us on our request for that information. For example, the Secret Service has been very good about giving us periodic updates on their COVID 19 related fraud efforts. I encourage the Justice Department and the FBI to follow that example. 
So, to any one of the three from the Justice Department that can respond, can you tell me when Senator Klobuchar and I will get a response to our April 7 letter? 
HUGHES: Senator, thank you for your question. I do not know the answer to that question. All I can assure you is that, when we receive letters, they're reviewed and work starts on replies, promptly. Replies have to go through a rigorous process. So, sometimes, it can take longer than we'd all like. 
I'd defer to Mr. Carpenito on any substance that that letter was seeking to elicit. But we have your letter and I understand it's being worked on. And I can check with OLA, after this hearing, as to the status. 
GRASSLEY: Also, to anybody from the Justice Department and or the FBI witnesses. I'm interested in what difficulties, or obstacles, have you encountered when investigating and prosecuting these cases. 
CARPENITO: So, thank you, Senator. As I said, previously, thankfully, because of the invocation of the Defense Production Act, it has given us the tools that we need to investigate and prosecute price gouging. 
As you know, the act is what made the act of hoarding with the intent to sell materials that were designated scarce, by the Department of Health and Human Services, at exponentially higher prices than pre-pandemic prices, criminal. Without that act, we wouldn't be able to operate. 
The challenges that we have are the same challenges that you have in any sort of a disaster relief related fraud situation. We faced it in New Jersey, after Hurricane Sandy. As Senator Graham correctly stated, when you put this kind of money out into the ether because you have to take care of society and, you know, take care of those who are desperately in need of it, the cockroaches are going to come out of the dark and into the light. 
There's always some underbelly that's going to try and defraud these programs. We are using our traditional tools and our traditional partners to root out those frauds. It takes a little bit of time because what you see there is, there's a delay in the exposure, right. 
We have to follow trends, follow the money, to be able to root it out. With regards to hoarding and price gouging, I think that we showed a very aggressive stance. We brought our first prosecution, within a week of the invocation of the Defense Production Act. 
The president put it into play on March 23. On March 25, HHS designated scarce materials. On April 1, we had arrested the first person for selling exponentially higher priced PPE. 
The charges we filed there were for making false statements to the FBI because he was trying to hide his conduct and assaulting a federal officer because the individual coughed in the face of the FBI agents, who were looking to interview him and told them he had COVID 19, to back them away from him. 
But we were able to recover close to a million pieces of PPE and distribute them, within 48 hours, to frontline medical professionals. 
GRASSLEY: Could I ask one more question. I don't know which one of you can answer this. But I believe that China's decision to halt exports allowed criminals to sell fake and faulty goods to our hospitals, putting the health and safety of our workers at serious risk. 
Is it reasonable to believe that the increase in fake and faulty medical supplies were a direct result of China's decision to stop exports to the medical--of medical supplies? And if not, why not? And whichever one of you can answer that. 
CARPENITO: I'll take that question, Mr. Senator So, Senator, we can't talk about any of our investigations that are nonpublic. What I can tell you is, if you, I don't know if you noticed but on Friday, we filed a criminal complaint against a Chinese company for the importation of fraudulent N95 respirators. 
In that case, what we alleged is that a Chinese company sent to the United States, knowingly false materials. How were they false? They purported to be N95 respirators that were licensed by the FDA and by NIOSH, which is the licensing body for these materials that make them the most attractive to medical professionals. 
The N95 respirator has been so important here because what medical professionals say is that you need that 95 percent filtration to protect our doctors, our nurses, our first responders from interacting, directly, with the virus. 
These materials were imported into the U.S. with the intent to sell them to medical professionals. And when we seized them, they didn't look to us as though they were authentic materials. We worked with the FBI, the FDA and Customs and Border Patrol. We had the materials tested. They failed that filtration test. 
And we do intend to continue to investigate any importation of fraudulent materials. And I think you can plan to see additional cases coming in the future. 
GRAHAM: Senator. 
DURBIN: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Carpenito, you talked about putting $3 trillion on the table and lunching the cockroaches come in. In your testimony, you have identified six, six prosecutions, under the PPP Act, so far. 
Four and a half million loans have been issued, so far. So, let me ask you, are you just getting started, or is that it for cockroaches? It strikes me that, unless you have a pretty powerful statement, pretty early on, some of the adolescent efforts being made to qualify for PPP loans are just going to continue at pace. 
HUGHES: Senator, if you don't mind, I'll address the PPP. So, with that program, there are a number of ways that we get referrals of cases to investigate and, potentially, prosecute. 
One is just walk-ins, as the FBI will tell you. They have field offices, around the country and complainants will walk in saying that they're aware of some wrongful conduct, with respect to the program. A second source is data that we share, among federal agencies. I can't get into more specifics on that. 
DURBIN: I have a limited amount of time. How you collect it and get your leads is important but not critical to answering my question. Is this pace of six prosecutions, after several months and four a half-million loans, indicating you're just getting started, or this is the pace that you think will warn America not to try to cheat the government? 
HUGHES: I think we're just getting started. For the foreseeable future, we will be bringing these cases. There's limitations periods on this conduct, are anywhere between five and 10 years. And we are engaging, extensively, to ensure that the public understands the serious consequences of exploiting this program. 
DURBIN: I certainly hope, whatever you do, you continue this effort but do it more publicly, with more volume, calling attention to it. This exploitation that's spelled out in your testimony of six is almost laughable. 
HUGHES: I can assure you, Senator, there are plenty of investigations currently going on. 
DURBIN: These are not thoughtful, conniving individuals. They are just silly efforts to exploit the government in the belief that it's an easy thing to do. I mean, to invent companies, invent payrolls. I mean, that seems to me to be fairly traceable. 
So, let me go to another aspect. The Chairman just stepped back in. I'm glad he's here because I want him to hear this. 
When I got briefed, a few years ago, by major corporations in the United States, they told me that retail theft was so massive in this country that products that were made, exclusively, by one company, were being sold in volume on the Internet by sellers that went unidentified. And they had to be stolen. They were only made by one company. They had to be stolen from a warehouse or in the chain of commerce somewhere. They were being sold by the hundreds. It wasn't just a casual sale. 
And that when these companies went after this theft ring, they were stopped cold by Amazon, Facebook and eBay, who said, we have no obligation to disclose the names of our sellers, even if they're fencing stolen goods. No obligation to disclose the names of our sellers. 
You made a reference, Mr. Carpenito, to profiteering online with marketplace platforms like Amazon and Facebook. On March 25, a group of 84 state attorney generals wrote to these, those three companies and other online marketplaces to urge them to do more to crack down on price gouging on their platforms, including urging the companies to create mechanisms to allow consumers to report suspected price gouging. 
Question's simple. What kind of cooperation are you getting from Amazon, Facebook and eBay, when it comes to those who are using the Internet to sell products that are misrepresenting their health qualities, or their application in COVID 19? 
CARPENITO: Thank you, Senator. I can tell you that, from day one in the formation of the task force, we engaged with private corporations, including online retailers, to talk to them about what their policies were, with regards to price gouging, how they identified those instances and sought to create a referral relationship with those retailers. 
DURBIN: How are you doing? 
CARPENITO: Without getting into specifics, because there's nothing public I can tell you that we have been cooperating and that we have received referrals from those platforms. 
DURBIN: And so, now they're disclosing sellers when you believe that they have violated the law? 
CARPENITO: Again, I feel constrained by Department policy on talking about nonpublic investigations. But what I can tell you is that we have had contact with them. We have engaged and that we are working, cooperatively, with them on referrals. 
DURBIN: They stonewalled us for years on retail theft saying it's, eBay in particular, it's none of your damn business who's selling what, even if it's clearly stolen goods. And if you're telling me we've got a breakthrough here, when it comes to this pandemic and national emergency of those who are trying to sell, misrepresent products on the Internet, that you now have the cooperation of these sales places, these marketplaces. I think we need to know one way or the other, whether you do, or don't. 
CARPENITO: What I can tell you, sir, is, I don't know if I would use the term breakthrough, what I can tell you is that we have had contact with these companies. We have sought their cooperation and asked them to make any referrals of anyone who is hoarding or price gouging the designated materials, underneath the HHS order, and we have active relationships with, at least, some of the companies that you mentioned. 
DURBIN: Mr. Chairman, I'm going to quit here. I went a little longer than I should have. But let me tell you, Senator Cassidy and I have introduced a bill called the Informed Consumers Act. And it gets to the bottom line here to Amazon, Facebook, eBay, have to disclose to law enforcement when there's the obvious sale in their marketplace of goods that are either stolen, or being misrepresented to the consumers of America. 
For example, NIOSH cleared products and it turns out it's a big old lie. Some of these places, in the past, would not even tell you who the sellers were. The claimed it's confidential and private. 
GRAHAM: Well, I think it's a good question. So, let's--Carpenito. 
CARPENITO: Senator, what I can tell you is-- 
GRAHAM: --Would the bill help, that he's talking about? Is it a problem? 
CARPENITO: In my experience, the Department of Justice can use process. We can send subpoenas. We have mechanisms to obtain that information, when justified, where we see indications of fraud, or any indications that there has been wrongful conduct. 
DURBIN: This is a new development, if you do. And I will tell you, Home Depot came to me, no small company, and said, stolen goods with our brand made only by us, sold on eBay in volume and they won't tell us who's selling it. 
If that's changed, this is a breakthrough. And I-- 
GRAHAM: Yeah, I agree. So, see if you can follow up. 
CARPENITO: Will do, sir. 
GRAHAM: Senator Tillis. 
DURBIN: Thank you. 
TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here and the work you're doing. 
I--I was actually pleased to hear you all bring up and a number of the members focusing on counterfeit, the threat of counterfeit goods. That's something I've focused a lot on, as chair of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee. This is not something new to the COVID response. 
I literally saw a biking helmet that was marketed as one of the most protective, if you bought it from specialized, it did the job. I saw somebody just put their foot on this helmet and it crushed before us in a committee. 
There are a lot of counterfeit products, coming from China, that are clearly a threat to our public health. And now, it's only on steroids, in response to the COVID pandemic. 
One question, or a couple questions I have. You've talked about the PPEs and the N95 masks. Other personal protective equipment is something that we've got to focus on. But I'm also worried about counterfeit medications, potential when we have breakthroughs on therapeutics, counterfeit versions of those. 
They may, actually, fit the bill but not being distributed, according to licenses. In other cases, they may just be inadequate, or ineffective. I think the same thing, the same risk could hold true, in terms of test kits and some of the other materials that we're putting together for the COVID response. 
Can you tell me a little bit about how we are, specifically, focusing on that and whether, my suspicion is China is the greatest threat, but any other jurisdictions that we should be looking at? 
HUGHES: Let me just address, briefly, pharmaceuticals and testing and I'll allow Mr. Carpenito, or the rest of the panel to address PPE. 
We're working very closely with the FDA. They've taken a more flexible regulatory approach to help spur innovation in the medical device and the pharmaceutical space. 
The types of crimes in that area that we are focusing on are the obvious scams, clearly fraudulent products, or medications. We are trying to disrupt those quickly, largely, by bringing in an injunction, while a criminal investigation is still going. 
Some of the cases that we brought, so far, have stopped a scam selling ozone gas, as a treatment, unregistered pesticides, colloidal silver, and other treatments that were sold and marketed as either cures for, or effective prevention measures for COVID 19. 
TILLIS: If I was to be one, I'd chime in, is this a China problem, or do we have other jurisdictions that we have an equally, we have a similar threat, in terms of counterfeit products? 
HUGHES: The cases I was referring to are domestic cases. But I'll defer to Mr. Carpenito on the PPE. 
CARPENITO: So, once again, I could tell you what we see trend wise. And what we see trend wise is, we have numerous investigations and we've seen trends that there is the importation of materials that are either counterfeit, misbranded, or just completely fraudulent. Those are the three buckets that I would put them in. 
TILLIS: Primarily from China? 
CARPENITO: What I can tell you is that we have one publicly available prosecution that I can talk about, where we have filed a criminal case in the Eastern District of New York against a Chinese company that we believe, intentionally, sent fraudulent materials. 
TILLIS: And the Chinese company is a government owned enterprise? 
CARPENITO: I believe that's the case in China, sir. 
TILLIS: Yeah. I want to move on to something else. I want to keep to my time. I have a committee markup I have to run to. 
But Mr. Shivers, right? I want to make sure I got that right. I butcher names, repeatedly, here. First off, I want to thank, I want to thank you for the work. And I did get to listen to your testimony in my office. But can you tell me about other things? I was talking about some of the test kits, other things. 
Can you see any patterns, specifically, from foreign jurisdictions? We've talked about domestic production. That's important for us to look at but foreign jurisdictions that we should be focused on and, potentially, create consequences coming out of legislation from the Senate? 
SHIVERS: So, our investigations are not focused on importation. We are, primarily, looking for hoarding and price gouging of PPE and, also, counterfeit PPE. 
So, through the course of investigation, we may discover that the PPE that we've seized is either substandard, or counterfeit. So, we would address it after that. 
So, we work with, not just our federal partners but state and local partners to develop those investigations. And so, again, what we've seen is some of the PPE that we've seized has been counterfeit. 
TILLIS: Well, I want to keep close to the time. This is just a request. You don't have to respond to it. But I want to thank Senators Blumenthal, Cornyn and Sasse, who joined on a letter to the FBI and CISA give us a briefing on hacking. I don't know if you've seen that letter but I think it would be very helpful for us to figure out, particularly, with Chinese affiliated hackers, some of the threats that we have there. 
That may be, Mr. Chairman, something we could do, as a committee. But if not, I know there are a number of Senators who would like to get together and get a briefing of the committee on that and the threats that we should be, should be updated on. 
GRAHAM: We can coordinate that. 
TILLIS: Yeah, if we can get that done, sooner rather than later, I'd like for the FBI and CISA to be represented in that meeting. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Senator Whitehouse. 
WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Chairman. If somebody could dial down my volume. There we go. That's more like it. 
I want to ask about unemployment insurance. But before I do, I have to react to Mr. Hughes, your statement about your policy for answering letters. I don't know what is going on over at the Department. But I detect a policy of not answering questions for the record from this committee and not answering letters from this committee. 
When we had Mr. Rosenstein down in the hot seat there, a few days ago, I pointed out that, in 17, I think it was, hearings with the Department of Justice witnesses, not one question for the record from a senator was answered, afterwards. Not one. That's not a coincidence; that's a policy. 
When we get questions for the record answered, it's because it's a nomination hearing. And the nominee doesn't go forward, until the QFRs are answered. Outside of that, the policy seems to be, we the Department of Justice, don't answer committee questions, for the record. 
I have a similar problem with letters. So, I don't believe what you said about there being a responsible policy for getting letters answered. 
We have letter after letter after letter to DOJ and FBI that have gone completely unanswered. We finally got a letter out of the antitrust division, recently, by putting a hold on a piece of legislation that the antitrust division wanted. And the answer we got from the antitrust division was a blow off. It was a nonsense answer. It did not answer the actual questions. 
So, I would ask you to take back to the Department, what the heck is going on? Because this exceeds the partisanship that I see out of the Department. This is a persistent failure of response to oversight and it is not always going to be a Republican attorney general. It's going to be, it's not always going to be a Republican chairman. Something is wrong. There is a policy some place about not answering QFRs and not answering letters. And I am sick to death of it. 
So, please take that back. And I see the chairman nodding his head over there. So, this is a bipartisan concern. The letter that was raised was from Chairman Grassley. This is a bipartisan concern. This is not the time to get into this. We're going to get into this further. But somewhere, there is a policy and I want it rooted out because it is a wrong policy. 
Now, on unemployment insurance. Mr. Shivers, in your testimony, in the headings of the different elements of your testimony, you don't even mention unemployment insurance. It's not one of the topic areas. 
Mr. D'Ambrosio mentioned, briefly, unemployment insurance in his testimony but described it as just simple fraud. I don't know that that's accurate, gentlemen. 
Just in Rhode Island, we've had 3,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance applications. Our U.S. attorney is looking into it, after the Rhode Island State police began an investigation because they seem to be coordinated. 
The damages could be in the billions. The theft could be in the billions of dollars. IP information links entities to common fraudulent claims and also, to fraudulent common claims in the state of Massachusetts, in the state of Connecticut, in the state of Washington. 
I think you need to step back and take a look at this, as a very significant common scheme, very likely, a foreign led common scheme and take a much harder look at this unemployment insurance fraud than you are, appear to be undertaking, from your testimony here, today. 
I think we are dealing with, what may prove to be the crime of the decade, if not the crime of the century, in terms of the amount of money that was stolen, through a common scheme, run very likely by foreign crooks. 
And I would ask you, also, to take the message back that it would be really helpful if the Department of Justice and the FBI would support the bill the Treasury supports that former Chairman Grassley and Chairman Graham support, that will peel back the ability of foreign entities to hide behind shale corporations in America. 
Because what happens, as I think you know, is that they steal billions of dollars, through these schemes and then, they under the proceeds through shale corporations. We've seen it over and over and over again, the Department, the FBI, the Secret Service, have all testified about the role of American shale corporations and hiding criminal assets. 
And when you look at the extent of the theft from our states, through this unemployment insurance problem, into which federal money was poured in abundance, as part of the COVID response, I think it's a better bet than not that, at the end of the day, those proceeds of theft end up behind shale corporations, where it's harder for you to root them out and run them down. 
So, I'd be eager to have any response to the point about unemployment insurance and what you're planning to do to ramp up your response to this. 
SHIVERS: Senator, there was no ill intent in not mentioning unemployment insurance. I'm sorry, it's on, I'll pull it closer. 
All right. There was no ill intent in not mentioning the unemployment insurance. Just with the limited amount of time, I wanted to give an overview of some of the fraud-- 
GRAHAM: -- But here's the question that's got my interest, now; 3,000, that's a lot. 
WHITEHOUSE: That's just Rhode Island. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Washington, there are a dozen states that have this problem, and probably more. 
GRAHAM: From the Secret Service point of view, do you, Senator Whitehouse's question is, is there organized effort in the country, outside the country, to exploit this program versus just, you know, a handful of people misidentifying themselves. I think that's the question. What do you see, from the Secret Service point of view? 
D'AMBROSIO: So, Senator, first, just to your first comment, where you said it's a simple fraud. That really referred to the tactics and the techniques, as opposed to the scope of this particular investigation. 
I can assure you that the Secret Service is looking at unemployment fraud, as a massive amount of fraud. We do see it as an organized group. We do see connections, when it comes to transnational criminal activity, overseas. 
GRAHAM: Well, you should have said that. 
WHITEHOUSE: There you go. That feels better. Thank you. Now, let's make sure that these agencies respond, according to that, and not to the, not mentioning it, or calling it just like simple fraud because it was, potentially, billions of dollars in fraud. 
GRAHAM: Senator Hawley. 
HAWLEY: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd also be interested in further responses to Senator Whitehouse's questions. And I'm going to come back to that, actually, in just a second. 
Let me start, though, by asking about the recent controversy involving 37 Planned Parenthood offices, applying for and receiving funds, under the Paycheck Protection Program, despite their ineligibility. Just a quick review of the facts, here. 
The CARES Act states that nonprofits are eligible for the program, only if they and their affiliate organizations have no more than 500 employees. Now, Planned Parenthood has 60,000 employees, nationwide, which is 37 times the threshold. And there's no doubt that each of the 37 Planned parenthood offices, who applied for the funds knew that they were affiliated because their own documents claim that they're affiliated. 
In fact, Planned Parenthood's most recent financial statement describes it as one national branch with 55 Planned Parenthood affiliates, 110 ancillary entities that are, and I'm quoting now, ""controlled by those Planned Parenthood affiliates."" 
Despite knowing all this, 37 separate Planned Parenthood entities applied for and received and, therefore, divergent $80 million from actual small business, during this global pandemic. So, let me just ask you, Mr. Hughes, I'm not going to ask you to comment, or reveal any details of any ongoing investigation, but let me just ask you, generally, if an organization that knows it ineligible for a program and, nonetheless, applies, falsely certifies its eligibility and receives tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money, meant for somebody else, do we have a criminal conduct issue? 
HUGHES: Thank you, Senator, for your question. And again, you're right, I'm unable to talk about specific investigations, or the existence of specific investigations. 
However, the way the Department is approaching these cases is, the application for these loans is pretty simple. In fact, the part you fill out is, literally, just two pages. And there are a number of representations on that about the number of employees you have and your monthly average payroll and the nature of your business. And then, there are a couple of certifications, such as criminal charges and convictions, over the last five years. I believe that's the time period. 
There are some other information on there but those, those inputs were, specifically, designed to be objective measures that could be quickly looked at and scrutinized, for the purposes of determining whether an applicant intentionally misrepresented something material about their business that would allow us to proceed with charging and prosecuting, swiftly. 
So, we go with the facts and the law command us to go in each of our investigations. And so, this is just an area that, like unemployment benefits programs, we are focusing the Department's law enforcement and prosecutorial resources. 
HAWLEY: What you're telling us is that the application is designed to be simple, it's designed to be very factual, right. I mean, it's not supposed to be a matter of interpretation. Do you comply, or not comply? Here are the standards. Tell us what the facts are. Do you meet the threshold, or not? 
Have I got that right, I mean, that's the basic design of the application? 
HUGHES: Generally, and it is not an application, which receives a lot, needs to receive a lot of due diligence on the part of the lender, from the beginning. Again, so really, all the misrepresentation, the burden of that on the applicant. 
HAWLEY: What about executives of the organization, or other decision-makers, who may have known about, or signed off on any fraudulent application? When I say the organization, again, I'm not asking you to talk about any particular investigation, to confirm it, or deny its existence. But in general, if you have an organization where you have top executives who've signed off on this, would there be potential liability for them? 
HUGHES: I think the traditional--the traditional legal standards that apply to corporate liability and individual liability for corporate actions apply with equal force in this, with respect to prosecutions of this program. 
HAWLEY: Very good. Well, thank you for that. I look forward to seeing the progress of your inquiries, over time. 
Let me come back to the unemployment question that Senator Whitehouse was asking about. Mr. Hughes, I'll direct this to you, or Mr. D'Ambrosio. 
Do you have any sense of how much money has been lost, through fraud, in the unemployment insurance piece of CARES? And has the DOJ had any success in recovering any of those funds, to date? 
D'AMBROSIO: Senator, I don't have a specific amount of what, essentially, has been lost. I can tell you, I spoke, previously, anecdotally, from some of the financial institutions that we're working with, over about 100 of them. We've been told that an alert we put out in mid-May prevented over about $500 million fraud, alone. 
So, so that just kind of gives you a sense of the particular scope. We have been successful in recovering some money. We have-- 
HAWLEY: You have been, did you say? 
D'AMBROSIO: We have been successful. We returned, approximately, through an investigation, about $30 million to the state of Michigan. So, there are cases where this has been, we've seen some success and we're continuing to work very diligently on these cases, one, to identify, two, to recover the funds and then, eventually, prosecute these individuals for this activity. 
HAWLEY: Does anybody else have anything to add to that? 
HUGHES: Senator, the only thing I'd add is that, you know, this is a big and growing focus for the Department. We're coordinating in Senator Whitehouse's district, the U.S. attorney's office there, the U.S. attorney's offices in other jurisdictions, including Washington. We are coordinating, closely, with both, the Secret Service, the FBI and other law enforcement. 
We're also coordinating with the financial industry. As the Assistant Director noted, some of the quickest, the quickest tool is to get the financial institutions, where these payments that are, the rails through which these payments travel, to identify this activity and to work with us and state authorities to stop these payments, especially, when they're traveling, overseas. 
HAWLEY: Very good. My time has expired. I've got some additional questions on this front, which I will submit to the record. Thank you, all, for your service and being here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. 
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this important hearing. 
I think what we do know from this pandemic is that this has brought out the best in so many people that put themselves on the front lines but it also has brought out the worst, in terms of the kinds of scams that we're talking about, today. 
Senator Grassley has already mentioned the letter that he and I led, back in April, April 7. And we are still, Mr. Carpenito, waiting for an answer to that. And if you could, that's a long time, convey that. So, I'll just ask some of the questions because we are concerned about what's happening and what investigations have, actually, been opened. 
How many investigations has the task force opened? 
CARPENITO: With regards to hoarding and price gouging, we've opened several hundred investigations that are ongoing. 
KLOBUCHAR: And has the task force brought charges against violators in how many cases? 
CARPENITO: With regards to hoarding and price gouging, the task force has already filed eight criminal cases. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay, alright. And our there 100 lawyers assigned, is that right? 
CARPENITO: Each--the way the task force is structured is, I lead the task force with the assistance of Mr. Hughes. We have three regional coordinators, one for the West, out of the LA, U.S. attorney's office; one in the central, out of the Chicago, U.S. attorney's office and one for the East, out of my office. 
Each U.S. attorney's office has one representative, at least as, obviously, some districts are busier than others, there are additional lawyers working on it. And each of the Department components also has a representative. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Are they full time then, the hundred lawyers? 
CARPENITO: I would not say they are full-time. Some of them are. For example, in the early states-- 
KLOBUCHAR: -- Okay, that's okay, I have a lot of other questions. So, I just, we can, if we got this back in writing we'd figure out. Again, we're just trying to push for some actual results, here. 
Another way to do this, in addition to what you're doing, state attorney generals, is as you know, are doing a lot. Attorney General Ellison and I have done some work together on this, since the pandemic started. And are you coordinating with them on the price gouging? 
CARPENITO: We have encouraged all of the members of the task force in each 93 U.S. attorney's office and components to coordinate. I can tell you, personally, in New Jersey, we have a very good working relationship state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. 
We have formed a joint task force with the state attorney general. I know some other districts have done that, as well. And we have had virtual daily contact about referrals. And we've worked on cases and decided which cases fit more with the state's purview or the federal government. 
KLOBUCHAR: Your testimony indicated that the Department focuses on sellers charging, ""substantially higher prices, than traditional market participants."" I have a bill that I introduced and cosponsoring that bill, Senators Blumenthal, Hirono and Cortez Masto. And it would prohibit price gouging, during national emergencies and target price increases of more than 20 percent, above the pre-emergency services. 
And states with these kinds of price gouging laws have, say, targets of 10 percent to 25 percent. 
What are the--is there that amount, or is there a minimum amount you are looking at for a target price, by the task force and would it be helpful to have this federal law? 
CARPENITO: I think it would be helpful to have that federal law, as well as, as Mr. Hughes previously stated-- 
KLOBUCHAR: -- You made my day. Thank you. 
CARPENITO: I'm sorry. 
KLOBUCHAR: That made my day. 
CARPENITO: I think, as Mr. Hughes said, too, a sentencing enhancement for those who try to take advantage of situations like this national disaster is, I think, would also be a very useful tool. 
With regards to thresholds, I think that the target range you're talking about is the target range that we are talking about. The state attorney generals, the practices that I've looked at, the state price gouging laws are usually in the 10 percent to 20 percent range. We're certainly looking for markups of that amount, or greater, in our investigations. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. Last, Mr. Hughes. In your written testimony, you mentioned the antitrust division joint statement with the FTC on monitoring employer collusion, during the pandemic. I'm very focused. I'm the ranking member on the Antitrust Subcommittee with Senator Lee. And I am really concerned about what's going on, like the proposed Huber, Grubhub merger that there's been some discussion about, I shall say. 
And the fact that we're seeing more and more consolidation, during the pandemic. And on May 1, I sent a letter to the Antitrust Division and the FTC with a number of other senators, emphasizing the need for vigorous antitrust enforcement. The letter included a number of questions and we received a response from the FTC. But we haven't received anything from the Antitrust Division. 
Given the importance of this issue, right now, when can we expect a response? 
HUGHES: Thank you for the question, Senator. I do not know the status of that particular letter. I understand and agree that the subject of it is important. And I can go back to my colleagues at the Department. 
But I do assure you that the Department of Justice takes these letters seriously and we understand that accommodation is important to the legislative process. 
KLOBUCHAR: It is just making sure that we make this a major, major piece of our consumer work, right now, because it's easy just to turn an eye, with these major companies saying, hey, let's merge, times are tough when, in fact, what's happening is that they are squeezing out smaller and smaller companies. And we're going to have less competition, which is the whole reason we have the antitrust laws, to begin with. 
And last thing, I'll ask this on the record. So, I know my time's expired and I will ask it later but about this bill that Senator Moran and I just did on protecting seniors from scams. And we also know that a lot of seniors are targeted. And I will ask that later. 
Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Blackburn. 
BLACKBURN: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank our witnesses for being there, today. 
One of the first cases having to do with price gouging, was two brothers outside Chattanooga. And they were buying up hand sanitizer. And then running the price up online from $8.00 to, I think, $70, per container. 
So, if you would, talk to me a little bit about your participation with local and state officials and how you work with them. And I think, Mr. Shivers, this probably is best coming to you. And if you all will talk just a little bit about how you work with your state and local law enforcement partners. 
SHIVERS: So, one of the FBI's strengths is working with our federal, state and local partners. And obviously, working in the COVID 19 environment has been very challenging but that has not deterred our ability to coordinate with our state and local partners. 
There are a number of ways, and I think one of the previous questions is, how does the FBI receive information, relative to some of the fraud schemes. Obviously, there's a wide range. But through coordination with our state and local partners, we are receiving a lot of information, relative to COVID 19 fraud. 
So, because we operate in a task force environment in many of our offices, whether that's our safe street task force or violent crime task force, a lot of our task forces have pivoted to address the threat of COVID 19 fraud schemes that we're seeing. And so again, for us, it's just a continual practice of working very closely with our state and local partners and addressing whatever crimes are being committed, within their jurisdictions. 
BLACKBURN: All right, that sounds great. And then, when you are working with big tech and trying to get the information for online for fraud with some of these companies and, primarily, dealing with China and the fraudulent inferior merchandise and PPE that was coming out of there. 
How are you working with some of our allies in this virtual space, in order to get this information to shut these entities in and does big tech respond quickly to your request to shut down some of these entities and then, to block them off their server system? 
SHIVERS: So, as previously mentioned, our focus is not the importation of the PPE. We're primarily dealing with PPE on the front end, as it pertains to hoarding and price gouging. 
And through the course of our investigations, we are coming across PPE that may be substandard, or counterfeit. 
As it pertains to working with our international partners, there are a number of fraud schemes that I think we've talked about, today. Some of those fraud schemes are Internet-based. And so, as appropriate, we work with our international partners to develop information leads that may have a nexus to the United States, or leads that we may disseminate to our international partners. 
So, the international partnership is very important in dealing with COVID 19 because, again, a lot of these fraud schemes are emanated, from all across the world. 
We have a relationship with various entities in the private sector. And I spoke, a few minutes earlier, about a relationship with the banking industry. We also worked with the tech industry but, obviously, you know, that requires a legal service, in order to receive information that may be relevant to our investigation. 
BLACKBURN: Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Blumenthal. 
BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask our two Justice Department representatives. Have you, are you familiar with Project Airbridge? 
UNKNOWN: Yes sir. I'm familiar with the fact that Project Airbridge exists. 
BLUMENTHAL: A number of us, Senator Warren and I began an investigation, some time ago, asking questions of the six major distributors involved in Project Airbridge. And our inquiry has shown that there was cronyism and political favoritism that led to, tragically, misallocated supplies and government seizure of equipment that were going to providers that very much needed it. 
The cronyism and incompetence that was exemplified in this program had real-life consequences and, clearly, this Project Airbridge, which was a kind of pet project of Jared Kushner was, in fact, the bridge to nowhere for the healthcare providers, who needed that equipment. 
At the very least, there was incompetence, confusion and even possible corruption. Is there any ongoing inquiry, within the Department of Justice, relating to Project Airbridge? 
CARPENITO: Unfortunately, Senator, I'm not at liberty to discuss any ongoing nonpublic investigations of the Department. 
BLUMENTHAL: Will you commit to reviewing this inquiry and making it part of your investigation, if there is one under way? 
CARPENITO: Unfortunately, Senator, doing that would be acknowledging the existence of an investigation. And I'm just not at liberty to discuss investigations of the Department. 
BLUMENTHAL: Well, you'll at least read the results of our investigation, correct? 
CARPENITO: Once again, sir, I mean, I would be remiss to comment about an investigation. What I can tell you, is we're committed to rooting out fraud, in relation to any of the CARES Act programs and anything related to COVID 19 hoarding and price gouging. 
BLUMENTHAL: Well, Senator Schumer, Senator Warren and I will send you the results of this investigation and, hopefully, you will follow up on it. Thank you. 
Let me ask you about the fake cures, which are part of that, I think, $48 billion total number that Senator Feinstein mentioned, which is an astonishing and appalling number. 
If Americans have lost close to $50 billion, we need really aggressive and proactive law enforcement in this aera. I know you've said that you have enough resources and authority but I think America is going to be looking for results, at some point. So, I would suggest that maybe, you would want to review whether, in fact, you do have enough authority and resources because there can't be too much, when you're investigating this kind of fraud that, directly, impacts people. 
In a recent report, the Center for Science and the Public Interest found that, at least, 49 dietary supplements on Amazon with antiviral claims were making false and misleading statements. Do you have any such fake cures under investigation? 
CARPENITO: I would yield to Mr. Hughes. 
HUGHES: So, Senator, we have several investigations that relate to misbranded, or mis-marketed pharmaceuticals-- 
BLUMENTHAL: -- Have you brought any action against? 
HUGHES: We have. And we have brought a number of injunctions to stop the marketing of such conduct. We have filed criminal complaints against the individuals who have been marketing. 
BLUMENTHAL: Could you provide the details to my office, please? 
HUGHES: Yes. 
BLUMENTHAL: Let me move on because my time is limited. In terms of unemployment insurance, you were answering some questions, posed by Senator Whitehouse. What exactly, is the modus operandi of these potential scams? And are you finding actual criminal violations in any of these scams impacting Connecticut? 
D'AMBROSIO: Senator, as we've seen, what it primarily is, the scam itself, is acquiring PII, stolen PII, whether it be purchased on the black market, or through network intrusions and being utilized, using that information and applying to the different states for the unemployment insurance. 
Yes, we are finding violations and we're pursuing those cases. 
BLUMENTHAL: How close are you to bringing action? 
D'AMBROSIO: I don't have the specific information, as to how close we are to prosecution. 
BLUMENTHAL: Do you have a dollar amount, in terms of what the impact is? 
D'AMBROSIO: I have already stated, previously, Senator, is that we published an alert in mid-May and working with the financial institutions. The financial institutions are the natural chokepoint for these payments to go. They were able to prevent, according to them, over $500 million in payments. 
We've also been able to recover and return to the state of Michigan, about $30 million of fraudulent payments that were made. 
BLUMENTHAL: Do you have suspects, specific individuals, under investigation? 
D'AMBROSIO: I don't, personally, have that information. I know we have active investigation. 
BLUMENTHAL: Well, when I say you, I don't mean you, personally, I mean your agency. 
D'AMBROSIO: I would have to go back and get specific information, sir. 
BLUMENTHAL: Could you provide more details to my office, later today? I'm out of time, right now. And you need more information from your agency. So, I would appreciate additional information, later today. 
D'AMBROSIO: Yes, I will provide what we can, these are ongoing investigations. So, it would be limited. But yes, Senator 
BLUMENTHAL: Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Hirono. 
HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was very interested in the line of questioning by my colleague, Senator Durbin. Mr. Carpenito, you indicated you are now getting cooperation from Amazon, Facebook and eBay, about the selling of items. So, have there been any prosecutions, based on the information that you have gotten from the cooperation from these three entities? 
CARPENITO: I don't have any specifics about any investigations in front of me. What I can tell you is that we have done outreach with those outlets and that I am unaware of any situation, where we have sought information and haven't obtained it, pursuant to legal process. 
HIRONO: Well, apparently then, according to the way the situation was described by Senator Durbin that this goes on in quite a blatant way. And if you can get information from these entities that are platforms for the sale of these stolen goods, that would be a good thing. 
And so, I would suggest that you look at the Informed Consumers Act that Senator Durbin referred to, which is bipartisan, supported by Senators Durbin, Cassidy myself and Senator Perdue, that may give you more tools to go after these kinds of crimes. 
I think all of the panelists, you referred to hundreds of prosecutions, thousands of investigations, as a result of all the scams and fraud perpetrated because of the opportunities presented by COVID 19. And I think, Mr. Hughes, you indicated that there are serious consequences for people who commit these kinds of criminal acts. 
So, I'd like to know, has anybody gone to prison? Are you seeking prison time? What kind of fines are you imposing on the people that you prosecute for these crimes? 
HUGHES: Thank you for the question, Senator. I think for the frauds, the standard penalty of incarceration length applies, that normally applies, under non-COVID 19 related circumstances, with respect to some of the PPP fraud, for example. Again, a lot of factors need to be, need to necessarily affect how long a particular defendant's prison time would be. And whether they plead and take responsibility, or convicted at trial, also affects it, as does the sentencing judge. 
Back of the envelope calculation, just for PPP, would be anywhere, the average would be between 50 months and 100 months. And that is, you know, typical for the types of frauds we're seeing, where the proceeds are in the millions of dollars. 
Again, there are a number of different tools we bring to bear to address these problems and disrupt these schemes. 
HIRONO: So, Mr. Hughes, I am running out of time. But do you think that we should create higher consequences, or steeper consequences for people who take advantage, during a national crisis and a pandemic? You referred to the usual fraud kinds of consequences. But maybe we should be looking at, you know, higher levels of consequences. What do you think? 
HUGHES: Senator, I think there is an honest and important debate, as to the level of consequences for offenses, during a national emergency. 
There have been discussions about proposed legislation regarding sentencing guidelines. Those discussions, in the Department's view, should continue and we'd be willing to have discussions about other proposed legislation in that vein. 
HIRONO: You've been asked about the UI scam involving a Nigerian entity. So, apparently, a number of these kinds of frauds are perpetrated by foreign entities. And I'm wondering, how easy is it for you to, effectively, prosecute foreign entities. And do you need more tools, any of you, to go after these foreign criminals? 
HUGHES: I think, from a prosecution standpoint, I'll defer to our law enforcement investigative colleagues, with respect to investigations. 
But from a prosecution perspective, we have a number of tools, jurisdictional hooks, which permit federal prosecutors to charge and, effectively, prosecute foreign criminal organizations. And those tools, in many respects, are as robust as they can, given certain jurisdictional and constitutional limitations. 
I'll defer to my federal investigations colleagues for the investigations piece. 
SHIVERS: So, as I mentioned, previously, working with international partners is very important for us. And so, whether these fraud schemes emanate from a foreign country that touch our American citizens, we work very closely, through our legal attache offices, around the world, to develop information, work in conjunction with our foreign law enforcement partners to bring charges. 
Obviously, one of the potential obstacles that we would face would be matters of extradition. So, those are some of the things that we have to work through. But again, these fraud schemes, because many are Internet-based, have a foreign nexus. 
And so, with the FBI, one of the things that we've done, and this was through our elder fraud initiative that we work with the Department of Justice, over the last two years, is we have assigned Assistant legal attache's in various countries, where we know some of these fraud schemes emanate. 
And that gives us greater visibility, greater connection with our international partners and enhances our ability to bring those individuals to justice. 
HIRONO: May I just ask one more question, follow up, Mr. Chairman? 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator Hirono. We'll make sure you get to do that. Okay, thank you. Let's see, Senator Booker. 
BOOKER: I think Senator Hirono said she wanted to ask one last question. 
GRAHAM: Oh, I'm sorry. I misheard. Senator Hirono-- 
HIRONO: --I'm sorry. 
GRAHAM: No, no, I apologize. Yeah, ask anything you want to ask. I apologize. 
HIRONO: I think it is really hard to prosecute these kinds of crimes when the perpetrators are foreigners and our panel explained the difficulties. 
And so, a lot of this kind of information is still information that's already out there is going to be personally identifiable information. So, is there something more that states and individuals can do to protect themselves from the sort of fraud that comes about from stolen identities? 
GRAHAM: Good question. 
SHIVERS: I would say, just kind of a basic 101, there are a number of services, where individuals can have access to their credit report. And I would imagine that reviewing your credit report for anything that may not, you know, you may not have knowledge of would be important. 
But also, I think also taking preventive measures. And that is, obviously, the Internet, there's a way that, you know, the criminals approach individuals, sending these unsolicited emails. So, I would just say, just using, for the lack of a better word, basic common sense and how the public deals with some of these opportunities that these criminal organizations take advantage of. 
So, it's obviously, a very difficult thing but, again, unsolicited emails, unsolicited phone calls, where individuals are actually providing some of the PII. But again, as we talked about, some of that PII may be stolen. 
So, I would just say, just using some basic preventive measures. 
HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Booker. 
BOOKER: Mr. Chairman, I think the rule of the committee should be, it's better to ask for forgiveness, than permission. I know Senator Hirono knows that rule. 
But I'm grateful to be here. And if I can, I want to direct my questions to Mr. Carpenito, not just because he's from New Jersey, not just because he is bald, not just because Anthony Ambrose has said, who is both of those things, and said generous things about him. 
But obviously, these issues are really impacting our state. And I would love to get some of his insights. And so, first of all, we've seen numerous instances of retailers taking advantage of the global pandemic and gouging, charging outrageous fees for medical supplies, personal protective equipment, things that are really, we've deemed essential and are critical to the life, safety and well-being of so many of our first responders and others. 
This behavior is immoral, frankly, and reprehensible. My team and I have introduced the Prevent Emergency and Disaster Profiteering Act on May 7. There is no federal law against this kind of reprehensible price gouging on essential items that are deemed critical to the health, safety and lives of so many Americans. 
And so, Mr. Carpenito, I'm curious what you think of the power of having a federal law against this kind of gouging. If you can comment on that and then, talk about the prevalence of this in New Jersey and how have you, without that law, been successful in trying to combat these issues? 
CARPENITO: Thank you, Senator So, I agree with your characterization. I think New Jersey is one of the states that had one of the largest impacts from this type of conduct because, as everyone knows, New York, New Jersey, were two of the most impacted states in the country, by COVID 19. 
We also have some of the most vulnerable victims for this because we have a very large elderly population. And we have a very large healthcare system. 
So, thankfully, because of the invocation of the Defense Production Act and the swift movement by Attorney General Barr to set up the task force to enforce the act, we have had the tools to address hoarding and price gouging of scarce materials, those designated by the Department of Health and Human services. 
And that's how we've been able to operate. I have not felt constrained, as a task force leader, in our tools there. But as you mentioned, there is really a history and a record here, of folks trying to take advantage of national disasters like this. 
We saw it in Katrina. You and I so it in New Jersey, after Hurricane Sandy. And we've seen it, throughout the country, on a scale that we've seen never before, with COVID 19, because it's the largest health crisis we've had, since the Spanish Flu. 
We have been unable to address certain types of price gouging because there's not a federal statute. For example, things like toilet paper, things like, you know, meat, things like food, things like other materials that personal consumers need are better suited, under the current statutory scheme, to be prosecuted by state attorney general's offices. 
What we have done is, I've worked with Mr. Hughes, Mr. Shivers, and we made sure that we make those referrals to state AG's, where we think they have the better tools to prosecute those individuals because the most important thing is always, is just to make sure that these people are brought to justice, not who does it. 
BOOKER: I'm grateful for that response. And I do really believe there is an urgency to give on the federal level, more tools to deal with that. 
You know, on March 20, of this year, you announced the creation of the federal state COVID 19 fraud task force, with Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and our Comptroller Walsh. The task force bridges the prosecutable efforts of the state and federal agencies in a kind of coordination and cooperation, I think is really needed in circumstances like this. 
And so, I just want to hear a little bit more about the federal state task force, what kind of fraud schemes you guys have uncovered, since its creation, and what challenges have you all encountered in combating that fraud that you see out there? 
CARPENITO: Sure. And you know, we are very blessed in New Jersey. I can't speak about every state but I think that we've heard, as task force leaders myself and Mr. Hughes, have heard similar success stories, throughout the country, in forming partnerships, here. 
We've had a very good relationship, during my entire tenure with Attorney General Grewal's office. And in particular, working with his first assistant, Jen Davenport, and his executive assistant, Andrew Bruck. They've been in, almost, daily contact with our task force folks in New Jersey, sharing referrals. 
Unfortunately, I cannot get into specifics of referrals because the cases that I have on my mind are not ones that are publicly available information, at this time. But what I can tell you is, we haven't really seen a lot of hurdles because we've put egos aside and we focused, most importantly, on making sure these cases are brought. 
With regards to tools, like I said, the Defense Production Act has been a powerful tool for us. And it's given us the, you know, the authority to investigate price gouging and do so pretty vociferously and quickly. 
BOOKER: I'm over time and I'm going to submit more of a lot of our pressing questions for the record for QFRs. I do have one last question for you to put you on the spot. And I apologize for during this, in advance. 
But my question simply is, Anthony Ambrose, is he a great police director, or is the greatest police director? 
CARPENITO: He's a national treasure. I've been saying this, since I came into office. And we've seen it, during these riots. 
The fact that Newark stayed together, as a community, and were peaceful in their reaction to the death of George Floyd, is a credit to Director Ambrose, for his handling of law enforcement and a credit to Mayor Ras Baraka, for his community engagement. 
And I saw, first-hand, for the past 8 to 10 days, as other cities struggled with these protests, Newark thrived. And they're doing so because of the work that was done, through the Newark consent decree, with the leadership of Anthony Ambrose. And as I said, the community engagement and support that Mayor Baraka is showing for his police Department. 
And quite frankly, the support that both have shown to me, since I've been U.S. Attorney and focusing on violent crime, throughout Newark, through not just prosecutions but by education and community engagement. 
BOOKER: Well, I appreciate your reference to consent decrees. I wish that the current attorney general would actually engage and use them. They were a constructive force in the city of Newark. I appreciate you saying things about the extraordinary leaders, both Ras Baraka and is 100 percent true. 
And Anthony Ambrose is a treasure. He takes better care of the city of Newark than he does himself. So, I hope that you will, again, I say this on the record, encourage him to get out there, exercise and, you know, be more healthy, so we have him for a few more decades. 
CARPENITO: He's down 70 pounds. We're looking good. 
BOOKER: He is, he is, all true. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. I need to call him. I'm trying to lose some weight, myself. 
So, here's the deal, you all. I appreciate you coming to the committee. I asked you, do you have the tools necessary, the resources. Seems like there's some tools that maybe, we could utilize that you don't have. So, if you can kind of get your collective wisdom. I think Senator Durbin had a bill, Senator Klobuchar. I think, Senator Booker introduced legislation. 
So, get back with us about what we can do to help you. I mean, what can the committee do to change laws, or supplement laws, sentence enhancing, whatever. Just let us know. 
We thank you all for being on the front lines. And we'll hold the hearing open for the requisite amount of time for additional questions. 
Thank you. "

[*]UNKNOWN: Thank you for joining us for the 2020 International LGBTQ Leaders Conference. Closed captioning is available by clicking on the letters CC in the toolbar below the webcast window. If you are having any technical difficulties, please use the tech support chat at the bottom right of your webpage. Now, please welcome to the virtual stage, President-elect Joe Biden. 
BIDEN: Hello, everyone. It's wonderful to join this year's International LGBTQ Leaders Conference. 
To Mayor Annise Parker and everyone at the Victory Institute, thank you, thank you, thank you for your leadership and your bravery, for your belief in possibilities. A historic number of LGBTQ people ran for office this year and they won, many of them. It's an honor to be an ally and have been on the ballot with all of you. 
Vice President-elect Harris and I are committed to being the most pro-equality administration in history, but we can't do it without you and we can't do it without my dear friend Nancy Pelosi. Nancy, congratulations on receiving the Victory Institute's History Maker Award. You deserve it. Three decades in Congress, always on the right side of LGBTQ history. Always. 
And the fact that you can receive a history maker award for that and so much more is testament to your character, Nancy. It's a testament to the life work to make real the promise of this country that you've been devoted to and we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally and with dignity and respect. You're a dear friend, Nancy. You really are. 
You're an American treasure and I can't wait to work together again with you to continue the fight for full equality and usher in a new era of LGBTQ rights in the entire movement. God bless you, Nancy. You deserve this and so much more and God bless us all. 
MIDA: Good day to all of you and welcome. My name is Jason Mida and I am a proud board member at the LGBTQ Victory Fund. On a personal note, let me say how delighted I am that we are honoring my friend and our Speaker, Nancy Pelosi with the LGBTQ History Makers Award during today's plenary session. I also want to take a moment to thank Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and a devoted member of this community, also a dear friend, and let's face it, the best dressed man in town, Jonathan Capehart for taking the time to moderate today's very important conversation. 
You know, we are so grateful to Colonel Jennifer Pritzker, founder of the Tawani Foundation and founder and chairwoman at the Pritzker Military Museum and Library. For serving as an executive sponsor of today's historic panel that at this year's International LGBTQ Leaders Conference. Colonel Pritzker regrets that she couldn't be with us today. In her absence, I'm honored to share her following thoughts on the importance of this topic. 
Today's panel, 10 years later, the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell reminded Colonel Pritzker of one of her favorite stories for military and American history. The year is 1975 and seemingly out of nowhere on the cover of Time Magazine appeared Technical Sergeant Leonard Matlovich in uniform, his face fully visible with an earnest dedicated expression. The headline read ""I am a homosexual."" 
Sergeant Matlovich had been in the Air Force for 12 years with an exemplary record, but the Air Force didn't want him or any other LGBTQ American to defend their country in uniform. His brave decision to challenge this discrimination by coming out began to change all of that. He became not only the first gay service member to out himself on such a national stage, but the first gay person to be named openly on the cover of a national magazine. 
And this said to millions of LGBTQ people suffering in silence, you are not alone. You and your quest for freedom can be seen and it will be heard. His tombstone in Washington's congressional Cemetery is unnamed so it can serve as a memorial to all gay veterans. It reads, ""When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one."" 
An exceptional roster of other brave activists, service members, and elected officials took up Sergeant Matlovich's call to arms in the decade since and today, we gather to hear from some of them. 10 years ago this month, the Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act was signed into law under the deft leadership of Speaker Pelosi with unwavering support from our allies such--such as former congressman Patrick Murphy, both with us today. 
We will also hear from Admiral Mullen, Valerie Jarrett, and Dr. Aaron Belkin with the Palm Center, leaders who played key roles in ending the ban. Today, a ban on transgender service remains with us, but seems to be in its very last throes. This has been thanks to some of the same people here with us today and the work encourage of heroes like Sergeant Matlovich. We are pleased to honor them and look forward to hearing what they have to say as we take up the fight ahead. Thank you and enjoy today's discussion. 
LUCAS: My name is Claire Lucas and I'm the proud board chair of the LGBTQ Victory Institute. Since the founding of our nation, LGBTQ people have served in our military risking their lives on the front lines. Yet, for the majority of that history, more than 225 years of it, LGBTQ people remained hidden, faced dishonorable discharge, or worse. 
Don't Ask Don't Tell signed into law in 1993 allowed gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members to serve as long as they remained hidden. However, the status quo remained unchanged for trans service members. While Americans became more supportive of the quality, the injustice of LGBTQ service members having to hide their personal lives became more glaring and the administration of Barack Obama and members of Congress led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi were determined to take action. 
10 years ago, Don't Ask Don't Tell was repealed and for the first time in American history, LGBTQ individuals were finally able to serve openly. Anti-LGBTQ activists claimed the Sky would fall and disunity would erupt among fellow socials soldiers. But of course, their dire predictions proved unfounded. 
Today, you will get a behind the scenes look at the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, the perspectives from the White House, the U.S. Congress, the military, and the advocacy community. You will hear about the impact of the repeal on LGBTQ service members and the country at large. Under the Trump administration, trans service members were again targeted with a ban that went into effect in April of 2019, yet President-elect Joe Biden classy has promised to reinstate the Obama era policy allowing trans people to serve openly. 
When soon, all of our courageous LGBTQ service members can again be open about who they are, it will send a message to the world that the United States is a country that prizes equality. Whether in Baghdad, Berlin, or Washington D.C., out service members transformed perceptions in our community and influence policies at home and abroad. 
Thank you for joining us as we celebrate speaker Nancy Pelosi with the LGBTQ History Maker Award for her work to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell and for an insightful conversation about where we are and where we are headed. And of course, thank you to those who have served and are serving. 
TAKANO: Hello. This is Congressman Mark Takano and I am the only LGBTQ chairman of a full standing committee in the House of Representatives, the Committee on Veterans Affairs and it's my distinct honor and privilege to send a message of congratulations to Speaker Nancy Pelosi upon her receiving the inaugural LGBTQ History Makers Award for her achievement in leadership in overturning the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy in the lame duck session of 111th Congress. She guided the repeal of that policy, which was so harmful to so many LGBTQ service members and it's so reflective of who she is as a person, as a human being, someone guided by basic decency in a horrifying--horrified by any kind of cruelty that human beings inflict on one another. 
MULLER: Early on in my career, our biggest fights were about stopping constitutional amendments from prohibiting gay people from getting married and trying to protect people from discrimination. It was really hard to imagine today's world where now, I'm able to marry my wife, raise our daughter, and to be protected. And none of this progress would have been possible without the great work of the Victory Fund and it certainly wouldn't have been possible without Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
She's been an outspoken ally who stood in the fight with us, raised her voice long before so many others. She's been with us from the beginning. When no one else would raise their voice about the decimation of our community from the HIV aids epidemic, she was on the House floor fighting for needed funding. She fought for the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, for the passage of the federal hate crimes laws, and she embraced marriage equality early on, even voting against DOMA in the 1990s. 
Today, she continues to fight for us and for the passage of the Equality Act. She's a true trailblazer who is one of our most important allies in the fight for fold equality. Speaker Pelosi, thank you so much for helping create a more just world and congratulations on such a well-deserved award. 
KENNEDY: Madam Speaker, congratulations. When history looks back at this moment, we will see that you not only led the way of the Democratic Party, but you have been the conscience of our country. Fighting for progressive ideals but making them real for so many that for far too long have been left outside the inclusiveness that our country sought for from its very foundation. 
Whether it was fighting back against Don't Ask Don't Tell or at leading the fight for the Equality Act or trying to find all of the ways that we need to make our country kinder, more inclusive, stronger, and fairer, you've been at the forefront of every single fight. We're so grateful for you. Thank you and congratulations. 
FRANK: If it weren't for it Nancy Pelosi's political skill, courage, end devotion to principle, Don't Ask Don't Tell would still be on the books. In that lame duck session of 2010, she told the Senate that she would not pass the Defense Authorization Bill that they worked on until they agreed to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell. Some of them didn't like it, but they did it because they knew she would follow through. It was the most effective use of political power on behalf of the principle I have ever seen. 
BUTTIGIEG: Hi. It's Pete Buttigieg and I want to offer my congratulations to Speaker Pelosi for earning the LGBTQ History Makers Award from the Victory Institute. Your work throughout the years has made such a difference, including on Don't Ask Don't Tell. I think about what it meant when I first signed up to serve knowing that I could be fired because of who I am. 
And just a few years later, because of the work of leaders like Speaker Pelosi, being able to include some of my fellow officers as guests at my wedding to Chastain. We've got a long way to go on equality, but we've come such a long way thanks to leadership like yours. Congratulations again. 
JONES: Hi, everyone. It's Gina Ortiz Jones. I served on the Don't Ask Don't Tell--I served under Don't Ask Don't Tell and it was actually a four-year Air Force ROTC scholarship that took me from San Antonio to Boston University. And one of the very first things I had to do there is sign a piece of paper that said I will not engage in homosexual behavior because Don't Ask Don't Tell applied to me even as a cadet. So my opportunity to get an education, my opportunity to serve our country, die for our country if need be, all of that goes away just because of the times because at the time, there were not enough leaders with the courage to say anybody ready and willing to serve should have the opportunity to do so. 
Don't Ask Don't Tell is a policy that never should have been and thankfully it is no more in no small part due to Speaker Pelosi's leadership. We know Speaker Pelosi is always ready to throw a punch for the children and thankfully, we also know that Speaker Pelosi is always ready to throw a punch for LGBTQ equality. So Speaker Pelosi, thank you for your leadership and for your courage. 
OBERGEFELL: Speaker Pelosi, hi. It's Jim Obergefell from Obergefell v. Hodges. I just wanted to send along my congratulations on your honor as an LGBTQ history maker. You certainly deserve this award from your amazing work to help repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell to your report of marriage equality, it's something very personal to me. You have been an advocate and an ally for the LGBTQ plus community and you definitely deserve this honor. Congratulations again, Speaker Pelosi. 
LAUPER: Congratulations, Speaker Pelosi, and being honored with the inaugural LGBTQ History Makers Award. Your leadership in repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell is just one example from a very long list of how you've helped make America better for the disenfranchised in our society. 
I am honored not only to call you a friend, but one of my heroines. Thank you for inspiring me and countless other women. You not only busted through the glass ceiling, you've ensured that barriers are torn down that keep LGBTQ plus people, women, and so many others from living the lives they deserve. Congratulations. I love you, Nancy. 
GUNN: Speaker Pelosi, Tim Gunn here to help celebrate with you the 10th anniversary of the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell. You of course played the key role in that historic achievement and shortly thereafter, you and I hosted an LGBTQ reception in my apartment at which you shared with us the more salient details of how the repeal actually happened. It was an astonishing and electrifying story, I have to say. And you made us all feel like very special insiders. 
Congratulations on receiving the Leadership Institute's inaugural LGBTQ History Makers Award and profuse thanks for your unparalleled support for our community. You are indeed a history maker every day. 
MURPHY: Hi. I'm Patrick Murphy, the 32nd undersecretary of the Army for U.S. Congressmen from Pennsylvania. It's my honor to be here to present Speaker Nancy Pelosi the LGBTQ History Maker Award. Speaker Pelosi is one of a kind. She is a true champion for equality and I'm proud to call her my friend and one of America's best leaders. 
17 years ago, I was in Baghdad, Iraq. I was with the 82nd airborne division. 19 of my brothers never made it home. In my time in the army, over 13,000 of my brothers and sisters veterans were thrown out because of Don't Ask Don't Tell. It wasn't till we repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell, until we had true equality in our military, and our fight is not over. 
Speaker Pelosi do believes that either you believe in equality or you don't, you're either willing to fight for it or you're not. We all know she's a fighter. It's my honor and all of our honor to present to her the 2020 LGBTQ History Maker Award to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
CAPEHART: (OFF-MIC) The other side of the screen is, among many who are responsible, but as Speaker of the House, she made it happen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, thank you very much for being here. Congratulations on receiving the Victory Institute's LGBTQ History Maker Award. 
PELOSI: Thank you very much, Jonathan. Congratulations to you on your new show. We're all excited about that. (INAUDIBLE)-- 
CAPEHART: --Thank you very much-- 
PELOSI: --To be with you as with all of the guests who are here. You said it so well. Many people contributed to the success. I was proud to be Speaker to orchestrate how we would get this done and we'll talk some more about that, but it was about time. 
It was about time, the blessings of time, the blessings to have Admiral Mullen in the White House saying early in the year in February, early in the year that the time had come. It was about Valerie Jarrett being there with President Obama, without whom this would not have happened, calling for the report and the rest. And when the report came later in the year, we could deal with it. But without President Obama's courageous leadership and Joe Biden right there with him, as you know, he's a leader in these issues in many ways. 
And then, to have Patrick Murphy, what better spokesperson on the floor of the House and a veteran who serves with many LGBTQ colleagues in the military and saw the injustice of it all and came and spoke with that authority. And Barney Frank, oh my gosh. What he didn't say is that he's the one that got Harry Reid on the phone and just insisted, insisted. So he--he's very generous in his comment, but the fact is it was essential that Barney Frank be so much a part of all of that. 
We'll talk some more about others who were involved, but I'm honored to have Joe Biden say such nice things. The one thing he said struck me particularly is that we respect the dignity and worth of all people and that's why we love each other so much because we have this shared values. 
There is no question in our mind that this is an injustice and we have much more work to do. But I'm humbled by the award, but again, because so many people made it happen. But I'm happy to accept (INAUDIBLE) all of them. But to Mayor Pete, to Tim Gunn, two Gina Ortez Jones, all people courage--courageous in their fields, leaders, pioneers, visionaries. Cindy Lauper she, you know, I've been--we've honored her for her work in LGBTQ community. I'm honored that she's with us today. 
And Tiffany, she's remarkable. Tiffany Muller has done such great things for cleaner government. That's her pioneer fight. Jim Obergefell, really, you made so much happen in the courts that we could not do in the Congress. Thank you for that. And Joe Kennedy came in, it was right away the chair of the Transgender Task Force--task force that would we had their leader in this community and in the Congress. I'm honored by his remarks. 
And of course, Mark Takano as chair of the Veterans Affairs committee. How perfect is that? And thank you, Mark, for your kind words. But if you were to talk about how it happened-- 
CAPEHART: --Yes. Well Madam Speaker, I should point out, no one could see--no one could see you during--during all of those remarks for the remarks for the people you were talking about, but I could see you and the--watching your reaction to what was being said tells me that this was, of all the things, of all the accomplishments you have--you have made in your two times as speaker of the House in your legislative career is it fair to say, safe to say that this, the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell ranks in the top three? 
PELOSI: Yes. Well, it ranks here with the--with the hate crimes legislation, what we did when that was largely attributed to Barney Frank, but the, you know, and so many other people as well. But--but today receiving this has special poignancy because over the holidays, I found out that my nephew is--David is going to be Skyler and we are all filled with joy that Skyler has found her happiness-- 
CAPEHART: --Oh, wow-- 
PELOSI: --And all the rest of it. So we're very--this--my receiving this still had special meaning to Skyler and this award had special meaning to me for that reason as well. And I was thinking not this year, not at the State of the Union where I tore up the speech, but the one the year before, we had--we had a large number of trans folks come in uniform and we encouraged everyone to invite folks to be visible in the State of the Union. 
And we had the reception before and then after came back with--I don't know why there would have been some anticipation that there would have been a divine intervention, that the president might have said something respect--out of respect for all this, but he didn't and we were all crying in the room afterward. And I want to mention this because we were so proud of all these transgender members in uniform there and then Richard Trumka was there too, president of the AFL-CIO and he spoke about how proud he was to be in a room with them and what they meant to our country and, well, he was very tearful. So again, it's personal. (INAUDIBLE) it's personal. 
CAPEHART: Right. So it Madam Speaker, Tim Gunn sort of teased us by saying that at a reception at his home, you gave them the salient details and made them insiders about what happened, how the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell happened. And in the time that we have left, tell us. Give us the inside the inside skinny on what happened. 
PELOSI: Well, let me just first thank Clair Lucas for her leadership as chair of the board and also Mayor Parker. I saw her in action many times in Houston. I know of her great leadership and how great it is bet she held--heads up the Victory Institute, the fund. I thank them. 
Here's the story. Now, many of you have heard it, but you haven't--some of you in the audience here have not. But it's particularly salient right now because in another few days, we're going to take up that National Defense Bill again in the--the National Defense. Go back 10 years and in the--in the spring, I was at a Harvey Milk birthday party. In honor of his birthday, but of course in tribute to him. 
And I said there, I said we're going to be rid of Don't Ask Don't Tell by Christmas. I made that promise. We're going to be rid of Don't Ask Don't Tell. But I had thought the report might come out sooner and we have--I could honor that promise since Admiral Mullen had so early on spoke out in favor of the fairness of it all. 
So let me tell you, Admiral Mullen, I don't know if you've ever heard this story. So we go to the floor, we had Patrick Murphy's amendment that he worked so hard to go to the floor pass the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, the amendment of the National Defense Bill. We were so thrilled. We go to--I go to my members and I said you've made history today. 
You're making history today. They said yes. Will you repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell? It's not just that. In order for that to happen, you, my progressive friends are going to have to vote for the defense bill. Oh, no, no. We never vote for the defense bill. We never vote for the defense bill. We'll vote for the appropriations for defense, but we never vote for the defense bill. 
Barney Frank, John Lewis, (INAUDIBLE) Eshoo, you name it. The whole beautiful array of progressives, of which I am on. But however, so I said no, you don't understand, they're not going to vote for the bill. The Republicans are not going to vote for the bill. I can see it in their eyes. They're not going to vote for the bill. 
So in order for this bill to--oh, the Republicans always vote for the defense bill. They always do. They--they come here to do it. Well, they're not going to vote for the bill. Well, we can't. We'd never--perfect records. We have awards. 100 percent. We never vote for the defense. 
Do me a favor. Stand back stand in the back of the room and watch and you watch. Now the Republican Party defense bill. Boom. Nine Republicans voted for the bill. Nine. Nine Republicans. Seven had voted, to their credit for the repeal. Nine. That meant like 180 some voted--what's the number of? 190--186 no's. 160 no's. Well over 150 no's. 
There they go. I said here you go. Don't Ask Don't Tell repeal. Right down the center aisle, the parade of progressives to go vote for the first time and make history by voting for the defense bill in order to protect Patrick Murphy's amendment. But as I said, were not we'd not have been there and Jarrett, Valerie Jarrett knows this so well as does Admiral Mullen, without the executive branch, without President Obama, Joe Biden, and the--the commitment to values and equality and justice in the White House. 
So again, tweet new that--now, of course, then--then they didn't want to pass the bill with it in and people were, you know, the Senate, this or that. So as Bernie indicated, when it came down to the full now when we're taking that conference report, there was some unease on the part of some. So to--to comfort them, we said the only way that we will pass the defense bill is if we have a commitment for an independent stand-alone free standing bill that contained Patrick's--the essence of that legislation. 
And Barney was on the phone with Harry and we said should we take it to the floor or not? And Harry made the commitment, which he kept, that he was filing a fast track the bill to repeal--the actual standalone bill to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell. So it was a--that was months. That was months of, shall we say back and forth into this or that, but it was just the time, long overdue to get it done. 
And well, I was very proud to be part of that, but there would be no way I could accept this word by saying I accepted on behalf of the House Democratic Caucus, which was so--so courageous because it wasn't--it wasn't courage--courageous on my part. Dr. Belkin can tell you how blessed I am to represent San Francisco in many regards, including this. So that's really how we got there. 
I mean, Barney was so instrumental. Patrick Murphy with his initiative that he had served and then, of course, Admiral Mullen and Valerie can speak to the White House involvement, which was--without that, it would have been a complete nonstarter. But also, the members of the--of the committee that wrote the report deserve a lot of credit for their courage in the report that they put forth. 
We have more to do. We have to pass the Equality Act, end discrimination in every place. We have we have so much more to do, but we feel confident and pride--proud because of the courage of so many people too (INAUDIBLE) Don't Ask Don't Tell. 
CAPEHART: Madam--Madam Speaker, I cannot believe it has already been 10 years since the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell. And since the heroic efforts made by you, members in the house and the Senate and the three panelists were about to talk to on the other side of this. Madam Speaker, I know you've got a lot of work to do that's related to a lot of things that are pressing for all of us in this country, so I want to thank you for your time, thank you for your service, and to congratulate you again on receiving the Victory Institute's LGBTQ History Maker Award. 
PELOSI: Well, thank you. I'm honored to receive it. I thank Colonel Pritzker, I thank Claire Lucas, I think Madam--Annise Parker, I call her Madam Mayor. I think all of you. And it's an honor to be with you. Good luck to you. Good luck to you. And I will display this with great pride in the Speaker's office and the members can see--come and take pride in the role that they played in all of this as well. Thank you so much. 
CAPEHART: All right. Thanks, Madam Speaker. So now, coming up are three people who were very involved in the story that the Speaker just talked about, bringing Don't Ask Don't Tell from a campaign promise to reality. These are three people who I talked to, with the exception of Admiral--Admiral Mullen, but I did talk to Valerie Jarrett at the time when she was senior adviser to the president, I talked to Aaron Belkin at the time who was doing great research and was behind the scenes pushing, pushing, pushing these three. 
When I was asked to do this panel, I--when I saw the roster of people, the message I sent back after of course immediately saying yes, I said these are all of my heroes and they all know it. I got a chance to tell Admiral Mullen years ago to thank him very much for--for what he did. And I think with that, they are all here, they are all waiting. Let me bring in the panel. Here they are. Aaron Belkin, Valerie Jarrett, Admiral Mullen, thank you all very much for--for being here this afternoon. 
MULLEN: Good to be with you, Jonathan 
JARRETT: Thanks, Jonathan. 
CAPEHART: So Valerie Jarrett, I will start with you as senior advisor to the president of the United States. The floor is yours for your opening statement. 
JARRETT: Well, thank you, Jonathan and hello, everyone. And of course, congratulations to Speaker Pelosi for this award. Well deserved. Her leadership was instrumental in this effort. I'll begin by saying that the only time in eight years that I actually went to the Hill for a vote was for the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell voted in the Senate and I remember being surrounded by so many of the advocates who had been working on this tirelessly for many years preceding President Obama's time in office. 
But as you said, Jonathan, this was a campaign promise that President Obama made. And from day one, we went about the business of laying the foundation for this effort. Now, all of the advocates we're watching will who are watching will remember that they turned up the heat pretty quickly and I think their first choice was that the president should, on his own, unilaterally stop discharging people from the military who were openly gay. 
But President Obama was really looking for sustainable change. He didn't want to do something which he knew violated his authority of office. He wanted to make sure that the military was on board and it passed through Congress so that we would never have to cross this road again. And that took a lot of time and effort into my team, led by Brian Bond, who many of you know was responsible for LGBTQ outreach and we had a broad agenda. And many of the accomplishments over the arc of his presidency came to fruition. 
But this one was really so important. And the reason why I wanted to be there on the Hill is because I had been so touched by the stories of those who were serving in the military and had to hide who they were. And I had people come to the White House out of uniform to share those stories with me and I remember one woman talked about the fact that she couldn't display the photograph of her partner on her desk or invite her partner to any of the events that had to do with work. She had to basically lie about who she was. 
Another woman even more acutely told me about teaching ethics at West Point, which was her job and she said how do I teach ethics to our men and women in the--in the military when I'm living a lie myself? How do I reconcile that? And so these stories that I've heard on an ongoing basis, thanks to Brian bringing these people into the White House so that they can share the impact that this law has was having on them just inspired me and moved me deeply. 
And believe me, we were catching a lot of heat from our (INAUDIBLE) and one of the funny stories was at the ceremony when the president actually assigned to the repeal, Brian in his mischievous spirit sat me next to the people who'd been most vocal on television criticizing us. And there were tears all the way around, Jonathan, and I think it's a--it was a template for how government and advocacy groups tried to right wrongs and tried to move that arc of the moral universe towards justice. 
And I would also mention that the day Don't Ask Don't Tell passed the Senate was the same day that the DREAM Act failed. And my team had been working on both. I remember President Obama went up to my office and he said to everyone, people who were--who are shedding tears of joy and tears of sorrow and he said we have to be inspired by what happened on Don't Ask Don't Tell and not give up the fight. That the fight is long and it is arduous and it is painful, but it is so worth it. 
And in closing, I really want to give a shout out to Admiral Mullen because Admiral, I was in my office when you testified on the Hill in early 2010 and I will never forget that you made it personal. You were chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but you made your remarks personal to say a few things. Number one, that we can't ask this of those who served to ask them to live a lie and that you believed that the military would rise to this occasion and embrace those who were openly gay equally among their membership. And I think that the long painful process that we went through to enact this law, which required consultation and surveys and reports from the military is why it has been such a successful law not on the books, but in practice. 
CAPEHART: Thanks, Valerie. And that is a great segue to probably my first military hero, true military hero, Admiral Mullen. The floor is yours. 
MULLEN: Thanks, Jonathan. And thanks, Valerie, for those comments. It's interesting sitting in a panel like this one--one might think that we know a lot about what's gone on in everybody else's area, and that's just not the case. So listening to Speaker Pelosi very special woman and very special leader and knowing from where I sat that, you know, knowing at a high level this wasn't going to be easy but actually, my expectation was that she'd figure out how to get it done and I really wasn't into any of those details and she did. So I'd like to thank her and your leadership and congratulations for the award. 
I'd also like to thank Pat Murphy and Pat Murphy was somebody I was connected to early on when he was in Congress and he was a voice for this, you know, every time he had a--he had an opportunity to present and discuss it. Thank him, President Obama. Clearly, I mean, my story on this is I heard then candidate Obama on the campaign trail say, and I'm chairman, say basically that this was something he was going to get across the goal line. That got my attention and actually started to review and study it over a two-year period. This was not easy to put together, as you can imagine, inside the Pentagon. 
And going from that to getting to a point where it was possible was--was really extraordinary. And I did a lot of my own sensing, if you will, to group--focus groups around the world, including, we shouldn't forget, we were in we were at war in Iraq and Afghanistan at the time. And from my perspective, the way--one of the ways I say it is I couldn't get anybody younger than 30 years old to--to actually be overly concerned about this issue. The young people, and they make up the vast majority of the military, they wanted to talk about other things that were of their concern, but not this. 
And then the focus groups I did with those who had retired or been discharged about living a lie every day, that they were in uniform, those were the ones that really, really moved me in the end. And so I get--I get a lot of plaudits for courage the day that I testified. Actually, it wasn't--I didn't see it as courageous at all. It was an issue of integrity. That was core to me. It's core to the military, and testifying in that regard was really pretty simple. And what I found was that that actually changed the terms of reference for the debate and sort of set us on a path that--that eventually would allow passage of the bill. 
One other individual who I engaged a lot with who's no longer with us was a--was a dear friend, extraordinary woman who supported national security efforts for ever, and that was Ellen Tauscher who, sadly, has passed away. But I can remember conversations with Ellen about how out of touch I was as leader of the military with where we were vis a vis the American people. And Ellen was a huge advocate, but she also was right. So there are a lot of people that were involved in making this happen, and it was a privilege to be a part. 
CAPEHART: Thank you, Admiral Mullen. And Dr. Aaron Belkin, talk about--well we'll get to the Q and A. Give--let's hear at your opening statement. 
BELKIN: You know, Nancy Pelosi was my congresswoman in San Francisco 30 years ago when I came out of the closet and she has been my guardian angel my whole professional career and has been right there for me personally and for the community and what an honor to share the stage with her and with you, Jonathan, whose editorials were so important during that repeal process and during the end game. And you were as much a part of this as--as anyone we are talking about here today. And of course, with distinguished panelists Admiral Mullen and Valerie Jarrett. 
When Don't Ask Don't Tell was repealed 10 years ago, I was--during the Senate vote on CNN and I broke down crying. And I guess--and I guess we are talking about tears today, a few of us. And when I think about it, it was a little embarrassing to cry at that point, but I think there were three reasons why the tears were--were flowing and one of those was that, of course, it's so happy, but also mindful of the incredible suffering that the gay and lesbian and bisexual troops had suffered as a result of policies really going back to 1919 and the revision of the articles of war. Service members like Alan Schimler and Larry Winchell who were murdered for being gay, service members who were sexually assaulted and knew that if they had reported their rapes, they would have been outed and fired from the military. And so I was I was mindful of that suffering and I think it's important to note that today. 
And the second reason the tears were flowing at that time was that there was so many advocates who had been working for so many decades, some behind the scenes and some not behind the scenes, people like Grettig Hememeyer and people like Perry Watkins, people like Zoe Dunning, Michele Benecke and Dixon Osborne who started Service Members Legal Defense Network. I was--I was standing on the shoulders of the giants. Service members and civilians who had been pushing for decades and decades and decades towards equality. 
And I think the third reason was the stakes. And all of us during the conversation about Don't Ask Don't Tell repeal we're mindful of--of the impact on the military and the impact on the service members. But--but for me personally, this was never--it was not even about LGBTQ equality. It was really about America and what it means for citizenship when the government lies and lies in order to scapegoat a group of people and how incredibly dangerous that is when government policy is based on untruth and when those untruths get articulated in law and policy. And so--so part of the reason repeal was such a relief to me was that it felt like a moment when America was reaching its potential as--as a society based on equality but also evidence and fact as opposed to scapegoating and distortion. So it's a huge honor to be here today to discuss these events. 
CAPEHART: Thanks, Dr. Belkin. And as someone who has cried on--on national and international television, don't ever worry about it. Let the tears--let the tears flow. 
Let me just open this to a Q and A. And Admiral Mullen, I want to--I want to start with you because your speech before the Senate Arms--Armed Services Committee was on February 2nd 2010 and you famously said, as Valerie pointed out, you said I'm speaking personally. You wrote--or you said, ""I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we haven't have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens."" 
Through my reporting, I learned that, one, you kept your remarks a close hold, but two, you wrote them that morning at the kitchen table. And I'm wondering why did you feel that it was so important at that hearing in that moment to say something so personal to your point about the reaction of what that--what that meant, saying words that really did change the trajectory of the project you were about to undertake? 
MULLEN: Well I'm not sure--I may have been editing in the morning at the kitchen table, Jonathan, but I'm not sure I wrote the whole thing there. I clearly didn't share it. Normally I shared everything I was doing with my fellow service sheets and they were not happy after that testimony that I had not given them a preview, but it was--it was guaranteed to leak ahead of time and I did not want to take that moment away if I could preserve it, first of all. 
Secondly, norma--I mean, I recognized a long time ago that those hearings, that is not my stage, that is the members' stage and what I chose to do, which was against the norm was to make that statement in my opening statement, before it could get configured in a way by a member who is sort of a different slant or a different meaning. So I wanted to get it out there very early and I mentioned earlier in my remarks about the integrity issue. 
So there were not a lot of people. The White House had actually seen it, although I've gotten no--no feedback, quite frankly, at that particular point because it was all moving pretty quickly. I knew that Senator Levin was going to ask me about my personal opinion, so again, I wanted to get it out before the debate started on this stage, if you will, that was the hearing. 
So that was really--and I indicated earlier, it was--at that point, it really wasn't a courageous statement for me because it was based on our core value of integrity. And actually, from that moment on, you know, prior to that and too often the debate had been too often about sex, you know, and sexual orientation. 
From that moment on, the--no one who opposed this ever took on that issue of integrity. Not even John McCain, who I actually had sat with in his office just the two of us with one of his staffers six months before that and I raised the--he asked me about this and I raised the issue of integrity and--and McCain was--was actually sort of startled because integrity is so core to him as an individual. And--and even though he continued to oppose it after I testified, that was an issue he absolutely never took on, and I wasn't surprised. 
CAPEHART: You know, Aaron, Valerie talked about the--the import of what Admiral Mullen said in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. From your--from your vantage point, what did that mean for what you were doing? 
BELKIN: Well, I would respectfully disagree with Admiral Mullen that that was not a courageous statement. That was dashed that was historic and it was so great and it was the first time that a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had spoken in such terms about gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members in an inclusive way and it changed the entire conversation because once--and I remember exactly where I was at that moment. 
I was in a green room at the naval postgraduate school in Newport, Rhode Island where I was given a talk giving a talk on Don't Ask Don't Tell impact on the military readiness and people in the room were stunned as they were watching this. And this is where a senior in uniform senior uniformed officers at the naval postgraduate school, excuse me, the naval--Naval War College and--and what the statement meant was that moving forward for the rest of the repeal conversation really, you couldn't make the argument with a straight face that Don't Ask Don't Tell was good for the military. 
People tried to make that argument, but the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had just said that that wasn't right. And so that was--I mean, that was, frankly, the day we won, even though a lot of people and verily Valerie Jarrett, President Obama, a lot of leaders had to invest a lot of difficult effort and elbow grease, but that really was the date we won when Admiral Mullen made those brave remarks. 
CAPEHART: Valerie, let's talk more about President Obama's role in all of this. You mentioned in your opening statement how there were a lot of people who were not happy with the president, the administration in terms of the pace, people want to get done immediately, but the president insisting on--on a process, a clear process that would take time. There were folks who thought he wasn't moving fast enough. President Obama gave a speech telling activists to ""Make me do it,"" to give him leverage. To what extent did President Obama need that leverage to push repeal forward? 
JARRETT: So Jonathan, not only did he need it to push repeal forward for it Don't Ask Don't Tell, but he needed it for our entire agenda. As you know, he started his career as that community organizer on the Southside of Chicago. He believes that the power is truly vested in the people and that they have to show, those who represent them that they care about an issue and that that energy coming from the ground helps propel everything forward, not just this, but everything forward. 
And I do remember late in the process when the advocates were particularly annoyed with us Brian was supposed to have a meeting with them over at the old executive office building next to The West Wing and he came to my office and he said will you please do me a favor? Will you come and join me in the meeting because they no longer believe me when I tell them that President Obama is committed to this. And so I said sure, I'll come. 
So I was meeting--I was in a meeting in the Roosevelt room with President Obama just prior to that and he said what are you doing next? I said I'm going to go and meet with the activists who are upset that you haven't yet pushed through legislation to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell. And he said, you know what? I'll meet with them. And so everybody came over from EEOB and sat around the table in the Roosevelt room and I remember so vividly, John, him looking each one of them in the eye and he said I commit to you I have a strategy to get this done. 
Now, he knew he had to win the wind at his back because of all the hard work that Admiral Mullen had done in the military, but he also recognized that he owed them that accountability. A face to face meeting where they could look at the president of the United States, the leader of the free world and he could say to them I am going to get this done. And so that accountability I think is so important for those who serve in public life. 
CAPEHART: So Aaron, to the--to that point, can you talk about what lessons did we learn about American politics and especially LGBTQ politics from the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell? 
BELKIN: Yeah. I would say a couple of things. First of all, that facts matter and there was a lot of pressure on us in the community to not talk about the way that Don't Ask Don't Tell was undermining military readiness and talk instead about fairness and equality. And this is going back 10 years before the events we were talking about today. This is in the early stages in the conversation. 
But--but we said no, we have to engage the folks who are supporting discrimination on their own terms and they're saying that gays and lesbians undermined--undermine the military. Well, let's look at that and let's study that and let's figure out what the research says. So--so I would say the first thing is that facts matter and it's very, very important that policy be based on evidence. 
And the second thing I would say is that the people who opposed gays and lesbians and bisexuals in the military, and we have not spoken yet about transgender troops, so that's a--that's another conversation, but they were exactly right in positing that once GLB service members were allowed in the military, that would open up a space for other rights, such as marriage equality. And if you look at societies going back 1,000 years, the marker of a first class citizen is always whether someone can serve in the military or not. So the second important lesson from this is that service in the military is so important as a marker of citizenship. 
CAPEHART: You know, Admiral Mullen, actually to what Aaron was just talking about in terms of transgender service members, at the time of trying to repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell, there was a lot of talk within the military that the sky would fall if service members could--could open--could openly serve, gay men and lesbians. But as we've seen, especially with the current administration, transgender service members were--art still at risk. 
And I'm just wondering from your vantage point, how much more difficult is it going to be for the military or actually, I should say, for incoming president Biden too make transgender service members whole and allow them to serve openly also in the military without fear of retribution or losing the jobs they love? 
MULLEN: Jonathan, if I could just--one thing I'd like to say to Valerie-- 
CAPEHART: --Sure-- 
MULLEN: --Just as with Speaker Pelosi, I know there's obviously a ton of work that goes on behind making this happen and one of the things that I'm so appreciative of her and the president was how much patience they showed. I needed that patience to get the military leadership on board and I didn't know details, but I knew he was getting hammered by the left hard who didn't think that we were going to let it happen, first of all, and then secondly, you know, they wanted it now. 
And so that patience, that leadership that Valerie describes was absolutely critical to--to getting this done. And it was very obvious to me and other--other senior leaders specifically. You know, it wasn't too long after the Trump administration came in that I get a phone call from--from my good friend Aaron saying, you know, will you now get engaged on the transgender issue? And--and I--I--some time and I look at myself in terms of what I understand. And while I knew a fair amount about gays and lesbians just because of my life, you know, the transgender world was not a world that I knew a lot about. 
So what Aaron is saying, facts really do matter here and understanding the reality of it as opposed to their own rhetoric, it's oftentimes used to scare people off is really critical. But I'm in the same place. I mean, this--you should be allowed to serve your nation unless you are, you know, ineligible for some reason and this should not be a reason. Somebody that wants to raise their hand, be willing to die for their country, it should not matter what their background is. 
And hopefully--and in that regard, if I looked at execution of Don't Ask Don't Tell, of the elimination of Don't Ask Don't Tell, you know, a friend of mine who was the head of the British military, they had gone through this about 10 years before we did, and I asked them about it. I said what happened? He said there was great kerfuffle upfront. After it got passed, it was a nothing sandwich. 
It has been basically that for us. And so my expectation as President-elect Biden or President Biden comes in, that it will be relatively easy to get this straight for transgender personnel. And the military, now again, I'm not there anymore, but the military will be very supportive of that if that's what the president wants to do. 
CAPEHART: Aaron, from your perch, do you share the Admiral's optimism? 
BELKIN: I do. Valerie Jarrett and President Obama and former Secretary Carter lifted a transgender ban on June 30th 2016 and what followed was two and a half years of successful inclusive policy for trans troops and we know that it was successful because chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then army chief of staff Mark Milley testified in the Senate and all the other service chiefs also testified that there were ""Zero problems"" with inclusive policy. 
The next administration came into office and then implemented a new ban on transgender service members, even though inclusive policy was working. And the research shows that that ban itself has undermined--has undermined military readiness. I'm very proud that my colleagues at the Palm Center with former military surgeons general just released a report that showed that the band has been undermining military readiness. 
And for that reason, President-elect Biden has pledged that on day one, he will order the Defense Department to--to reinstate inclusive policy for transgender troops, policy that worked before and that will work again. And I have every reason to believe him and to take him at his word that he will reinstate includes a policy. 
CAPEHART: Valerie, when--when you guys came into the White House, President Obama and vice--then Vice President Biden, the administration began, as we talked about, repealing--Don't Ask Don't Tell was a campaign promise. But when you guys went into the White House, you had an economy that was in freefall, the auto industry was pulling apart, you had the dashboard was it the Horizon Gulf thing blew up. 
It seemed like every month there was a new calamity confronting this brand new administration. At any point was there ever any thought given to putting the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell off to the side, to not even deal with it in the--in the first year, let alone the first term? 
JARRETT: No. In a word, absolutely not. I mean, one of the strengths I think of President Obama's leadership is his ability to multitask and that we could move forward at a very aggressive domestic and international agenda by organizing ourselves around those issues. And so the people who were working on the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell were not the same people who were working on restoring and recovering our economy or any of the other big ticket items, the Affordable Care Act, getting out of two wars. 
We had a lot of business going on at the same time and we organized ourselves accordingly. So no, there was not a single meeting, there was not a single consideration of taking this off the table. And I think for all of the reasons that we were talking--that we've been talking about, Jonathan, and that is that this speaks to the core values of our country. 
If we want to have the best military in the world, we have to lead by example and be inclusive and not, as Admiral Mullen said, let criteria that did not--do not pertain to our ability to have that most supreme military be factors in who serves. And so this it is a core value issue. It was important to him and he recognized that we had to have the ability to move forward on multiple fronts. 
And thank goodness we had Leader Schiff in the House, certainly by Speaker Pelosi and everyone in her caucus who understood that we had to make tradeoffs yet, but not ones that had to do with the core values of their agenda. And so I think it was a team effort. The military, the White House, the president's commitment and obviously, Speaker Pelosi and then those in the Senate who stood up and did the right thing as well. Decisions that would have been a lot harder if not impossible for them to make without the leadership of Admiral Mullen and those in the military. (INAUDIBLE)-- 
CAPEHART: --Yeah, I--oh, sorry-- 
JARRETT: --Where one did not exist before, and I do think it helped turn the tide. 
CAPEHART: You know, I want to pick up on a line you all have used, particularly you, Valerie, in your last--your last answer, and that is core values. And I wrote it down. Core values and then put on top American core values. 
And I'm throwing this to--to the Admiral and to Aaron because given the current administration that we have, I'm wondering how damaging is it when the commander in chief doesn't reflect those core values? And I say that with the tweets that the president has sent out with regard to transgender service members serving and--and pushing really hard to drum them out of the service. What does that do to not just the--the readiness and the effectiveness, but the morale of service members? Let's start with you, Admiral. 
MULLEN: Jonathan, I'm not sure--I mean, one of the reasons this was in fact not that big of an issue that is Don't Ask Don't Tell, repealing that, you know, I try to remind people, the average age in any military unit is 21 years old. And--and these young people have been living in a much more equal world at their level as they've grown up. And so it is, again, sometimes befuddling that some of us older people, you know, get in the way of what they understand are their core values and what they live by, first of all. 
So there's no question and it's been this way through history that's what the president says matters. Those words really matter. And I think to the degree and the intensity and the length of time that any president and certainly President Trump over the last four years devalues our values, that is significant. I think not just to the military, that's significant to the country. It undermines our basic structure, our basic foundation, our basic being, the integrity peace, the equality peace, et cetera. 
As I said earlier, I don't think the--I don't think that has a huge impact on morale. There certainly are those who have suffered because of that inside the military, but I think the military will bounce back very, very quickly under the leadership of President Biden. 
CAPEHART: Aaron? 
BELKIN: Yeah, I mean, I've been concerned about the politization of the military, giving campaign speeches in front of military audiences. But on the question of the president's transgender tweets specifically, part of what was so dangerous about those tweets from my perspective is that they repeated a move that was made at the beginning of Don't Ask Don't Tell. 
So what was the similarity of the move? Well, in both cases, the gist, the whole--the whole push for bad policy, for discrimination was really about animus and intolerance, you could say homophobia in the case of gays and lesbians and transphobia in the case of trans troops. But there was a veneer that was put on top of that that wasn't true that was that the reason that we have to discriminate is because gays and lesbians or then later transgender troops undermine the military. 
And so you had the president of the United States making a claim about military readiness that was designed to crowd a motive that was grounded in animus and intolerance. And that is very dangerous for reasons we've discussed when--when leaders and policymakers don't tell the truth about what they're doing. 
CAPEHART: Valerie, how much do you see the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell as part of your legacy of public service in the White House? 
JARRETT: Jonathan, you know that I my commitment to the strength of diversity, inclusion, a more equal and just world has been what has driven me since my early days in public service. And so this was really important to me. But I want to emphasize it was that what's important is is it important to our country? And so not just for those service members who could openly serve, but for the strength of our military and the character and integrity of those core values, as I said before, of our country. I think that's what's most important. 
And I think it lays a predicate for much of the change that we still have left that lies ahead, as Speaker Pelosi mentioned in her remarks. We are not done yet. We still have many examples across our country of injustice. Racial injustice, injustice based on gender identity and sexual orientation, faith, on age, on people with disabilities. We have a lot of hard work to do that lies ahead. 
But what I think is instrumental here is that it is that it is a road map for how change happens where advocates recognize their power, where there are resilient and determined and do not give up. And I know just as you said, we didn't give up. Well you know what? They didn't give up either. 
And for those who fought the battle knowing that they had already been discharged and wouldn't necessarily see the benefit of this work personally but recognize that there or stories that they could tell about the impact that this unfair law was having on their lives, all of that was a part of what makes the foundation of our democracy so strong. And I think it's also why we need to have leaders who understand that their responsibility is to serve all of the country, not just some of the country, but the entire country and that that rich diversity of our country is what gives us a competitive advantage. 
It's what allows the United States to lead the world. And so fighting for those core values takes hard work. It all takes longer than it should. We are celebrating the 100th anniversary of white women having the right to vote this year and we know that it took decades longer for black women to have that right to vote. So these journeys have always been arduous. 
And I'd say--I guess I would say in closing of this that remember when President Obama took office, marriage equality was only legal in two states. So by the time the Supreme Court ruled, six years later, it was legal in 37 states and the District of Columbia. Why? Because advocates went state by state by state and fought that battle and changed our culture, and that's how change happens in America. 
CAPEHART: Admiral Mullen, you've said several times in this--in our conversation that you don't view what you said at the Senate Armed Services Committee as courageous at all, but I do wonder where does the successful repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell fall in terms of your accomplishments? I'm wondering how important is it to your legacy as an Admiral, a member of the military and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
MULLEN: I think, Jonathan, more important than I understood at the time. When I first took over the job under President Bush in 2007, one of my immediate staff assistants said to me you really need to be thinking about your legacy and I look at her and I said I'm not interested in my legacy. My legacy is going to be what it is going to be. 
So--and that has counter, oftentimes counter intuitive in Washington where people are trying to pound out legacies from day one. And so I just didn't have time to think about that. That said, Admiral John Kirby who is my public affairs officer at the time, you know, that night after I testified is you--this is what you will be most remembered for is that testimony. So I--and I suppose that--that really is true. Not that I was trying to gain that, but it is a fact. I was there, it was a great privilege to be there, and a great opportunity. 
And it obviously has made a huge, huge difference. I didn't understand even at the time, I just didn't understand how critical this link in the chain of inequality, you know, finally bringing it together, finally joining it would be and actually provide another link for the chain downstream to be put together as both the Speaker and Valerie and Aaron have said today. 
CAPEHART: Aaron, your work is ongoing, so I don't have legacy question for you like I had for Valerie and for the Admiral, but from your--your vantage point in terms of the ongoing fight for LGBTQ equality, where--where are we now that we do have--we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell. We are five years out from marriage equality being--being the law of the land. Where is the next--where is I was going to say the next battle, no, where is the battle being waged now? 
BELKIN: Yeah, I want to answer that, but first, just briefly touch on, if it's okay, a question of legacy. 
CAPEHART: Sure. 
BELKIN: Actually, Admiral Mullen's and--and Valerie Jarrett's and President Obama's. I returned to West Point and the Air Force Academy almost every year to give talks about LGBT military issues and for the first time after Don't Ask Don't Tell was repealed, I could actually meet with--with the cadets and the students themselves and now, when you have those meetings with groups of LGBT students, they don't even know about Don't Ask Don't Tell. 
They know about--but--but I tell them when that happens, I say this is exactly what everyone was fighting for. This is the legacy that you don't have to worry about discrimination. You don't need to worry about--about hiding or about here or about anything like that. And it just it's so moving to see the lightness. They don't carry the burden of discrimination. 
In terms of where the fight is now, in the military, President-elect Biden is going to reinstate inclusive policy for transgender troops. There's some additional work to be done in terms of working with the VA to offer sword surgery too transgender veterans. There is the question of military service by non-binary service members, service members also with intersex DSD conditions, and then there's going to be a complicated conversation over transition related surgery for family members independent who get their health care through a military health insurance program called Tricare. 
So there are fights left in the military and then beyond that, I would just echo what Valerie Jarrett said that, to my mind, the struggle struggles that lay ahead are really intersectional. And to my mind, they're about the ability of the community to work across lines of class, race, ethnicity, ability, enter to work together as Americans to lift all of our boats together. 
CAPEHART: I'm going to ask you one more--one more question before I go round robin one more time with--with final thoughts. Given the political environment that we are in right now, just ask you to speak broadly, how concerned are you that the rights of the community is pushing for and demanding and is, you know, requesting of--of their government that they won't--they won't be achieved because gridlock has become so intense that it really is putting the lock in gridlock that nothing will happen. Are you--how concerned are you that nothing will move no matter how hard the Biden administration pushes? 
BELKIN: Yeah, so I see there's only a minute left, so I'll just say briefly so the other speakers can--can wait in, but what I'm most concerned about is gridlock in Congress and also the courts, that the courts aren't going to work very hard to rollback hard won rights moving forward. 
CAPEHART: All right, well we--we have a chunk of time left for--for closing statements. There is no question. I'm just giving you each an opportunity to give final thoughts before we closeout this great discussion. Admiral Mullen, I will start with you. Your--your closing thoughts. 
MULLEN: Just--just a moment that I think will--and Aaron started with this, you know, saying that he had, you know, was--was in tears on national television at one point. Right after--there's such a human dimension to this Don't Ask Don't Tell story. 
Right after I retired, the following October, I was asked to go to an event in Washington--in New York on the Intrepid that--that many of the advocates for this wanted to just say thanks. And I--I declined, basically, because I was--I almost looked at it, look, I'd given at the office, I just need some time to rest and spend time at my with my family. At year later--and I said let's look at it next year. 
The following year, I agreed to do this. And what one of the leaders said to me--so we went to New York. My wife and I went to New York and it was--it was as joyous a celebration of about 1100 people as I had ever seen in my life. I mean, it was just--there was a freedom aspect of it, there was just out and out joy and tears. And what one gay and lesbian leader told me is what you don't--talking to me, what you don't understand is you are in so many of these people's lives the first person in authority in their life that has ever said it's okay and acknowledges them. And that's from their family, their school, their jobs, whatever it might be. 
And that was jarring to me that that that was part of it. And they wanted to say thanks for that. And then, at that affair was an 82, 83, 84 year old World War II veteran who literally came up to me who was gay and had fought in World War II and was heroic in his fight and he just looked at me, sort of grabbed me by the soldier shoulders and said he couldn't thank me enough. He had been waiting his whole life to be acknowledged for who he was. And I'll never forget that. 
CAPEHART: Wow. Anybody--I mean, I have chills hearing that story, Admiral. Thank you for sharing that story. Senior adviser to the president of the United States, Valerie Jarrett, to President Obama, your closing thoughts. 
JARRETT: So a year after the effective date of the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, the Defense Department had a gay pride celebration at the Pentagon, something that would have been unheard of prior to the passage of the repeal of the law and they invited me to come and speak, which of course, I was honored to do. And I remember as I walked up to the podium I started looking around the auditorium at the audience and several of the people who had come to the White House to advocate for the repeal of the law were sitting in the audience in uniform. 
And I--I literally could not speak for a minute. I was so moved to tears to think that we had changed not only their lives, but the lives of so many Americans who wanted to serve in our military and either were deterred from entering or felt they had to tell a lie in order to serve. And that was over and--and the fact that now we're going to have future generations who have no idea what we're talking about when we talk about discrimination in the military, and that's how our country moves forward. 
And so I'll never forget that day looking around the room. I can still see their faces and they all kind of winked at me, but they were able to sit there proudly being who they are while making--while being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. And that reflects to me the goodness of America and I think it's the goodness that we have to fight for, it's a goodness that we've seen over the last four years that we cannot take for granted, and it's a goodness that is grounded in the hard work of ordinary people prepared to do extraordinary things. 
CAPEHART: And Dr. Aaron Belkin, founding--founding director of that Palm Center, a great resource for the me during the--during the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, your closing thoughts? 
BELKIN: It's been the owner of a lifetime to work for the last 21 years towards inclusive policy for LGBT service members in the military. It has been the owner of a lifetime to serve on this panel and to celebrate history, which--with--with such distinguished panelists. 
I think in closing, I will just remain mindful of the--the sacrifices that LGBT service members have made to--to serve their country and the bravery. You know, my advocacy is in a library, so I--I--you know, that's not difficult work to do, but I think about people like Frank Kameny who in 1965 when it was very unsafe to do this was parading in front of the White House with a sign that said, ""Let homosexuals serve in the military,"" using fashion using language of the day. 
I think about my friend and colleague Admiral Al Steinman. The only way he was able to make admiral was for him to pretend to be straight for his 30 year career, which meant having phony dates to formal military occasions where he would take someone he would pretend to be is his--his girlfriend and all the range of--of brave sacrifices that others have made--have made. 
So I'm just--all I feel at this point is--is gratitude and--and hopefulness moving forward that we're going to extend the rights that folks have earned for, again, lesbian service members. We're going to get them back for trans troops and we're going to move forward from--from then. 
CAPEHART: And I just wanted to end by saying what I said at the beginning, which is when I was asked to--to do this--to do this panel after immediately saying yes and seeing who was on the roster to be a part of this conversation that we had, I really did say wow, these are all of my heroes. Admiral Mullen, Valerie Jarrett, Aaron Belkin, thank you very, very much for being here this afternoon, for your service to our country, but most importantly, for all the work you did both publicly and behind the scenes to bring this country a big step closer to living out its ideals. Thank you very, very much. 
MULLEN: Thanks, Jonathan. 
JARRETT: Bye-bye, everybody. 
UNKNOWN: Here to present the inaugural 2020 Global Trailblazer Award, please welcome Peruvian Congressman, Alberto de Belaunde. 
DE BELAUNDE: Thank you. I want to thank Victory Institute for this opportunity. I'm very excited because this is the first edition of the Global Trailblazer Award. This award seeks to recognize openly LGBTQ leaders around the world who with their work and example are helping to break down the barriers of prejudice, hate, and fear. 
Not only does their example inspire their constituents, but the strength of their testimony and work enables them to inspire thousands of people around the world. Leaders who represented the message of love, freedom, and dignity that characterizes our community and who help advance the path to equality. Leaders like Lucia Riojas. Lucia currently serves as federal deputy of the Congress of the Union in Mexico. 
She's a longtime LGBTQ activist. Lucia participated get the Yo Soy 132 student movement, which protested police brutality, governmental overreach, and supported better working conditions and the freedom to protest. That movement, which has been dubbed Mexico's spring and Mexico's Occupy movement inspired partner protests in over 50 countries. 
Lucia is also core director of Casa Frida, a shelter in Mexico City for LGBTQ people who are homeless or struggling at home. Though she and her partner have been targeted for her work, she still encourages the LGBTQ community to, and I quote, ""Go out into the streets proud of who you are."" It's an honor for me to virtually give the first Global Trailblazer Award to Lucia Rojas. (UNTRANSLATED) 
RIOJAS MARTINEZ: (UNTRANSLATED) And a big thank you to everyone at the Victory Institute and to all this year's sponsors for making this (INAUDIBLE) community building event happened digitally and, most importantly, for free. I feel incredibly honored to be the first recipient of the Global Trailblazer Award and to be considered for the Tammy Baldwin Breakthrough Award alongside so many brave colleagues. 
Sarah, Leslie, Caesar, Marie, and Malcolm, to be in the same category as you is as encouraging personally as it is politically. And congratulations to you, Malcolm. I hope we can all celebrate in person in a post vaccine world. I know that will eventually happen because I am an optimist, which is also what makes me so excited about this event. Unbridled optimism for the future to recognize members of our community who don't seem simply occupy seats, but who are committed to ensuring out respective congresses, out effective places for LGBT plus representation is to clearly envision a future for us. 
It's a (INAUDIBLE) on diversity, on inclusion, and on love as a means of political resistance and collective action. Today, we need that encouragement more than ever. In Mexico, the LGBT plus population has always been incredibly resilient and vocal. In fact, I am particularly thankful for in that we are in the current climate since we are facing an increasingly adversarial government. 
Historically, few and far between have taken the time to both understand the multiplicity of needs in demands of LGBT plus persons, but during a time of global pandemic, the--the absence of the state has sent a clear signal of this interest. With medicine shortages, budget cuts, rampant violence and a government with a strong conservative base even before the pandemic, Mexico was not an easy place to be for most of the LGBT plus population. 
However, the added challenge of COVID-19 has meant that, for many, the only safe space spaces they knew disappeared. The queer bars they hang out in, social clubs, and even streets historically occupied by the LGBT plus community closed their doors or it became deserted. 
Logistically speaking, it has also been an uphill road. The conservative majority and the opposing minority, which is unfortunately also conservative oftentimes appear unsurmountable. Their policy efforts focus on expanding (INAUDIBLE) centralized and militarized agenda that, of course, tramples over all of our human rights and disproportionately effects queer people. 
I would be remiss not to highlight there have been important advancements in the political fight for visible, dignified, and plural representation. As well as in respect for our rights as citizens and human beings. Yet, I want to pick a paint a realistic picture of a country of 130 million people where the average salary does not exceed $150 a month and where conservative ideologies continue to threaten our progress with hate hey (PH) for calculations. 
Marriage and adoption for LGBT plus partnerships has been recognized nationally by the Supreme Court, but they have not been ratified in every state. Similarly, treatment for those living with HIV is suffered--is suffered through public institutions, but almost impossible to attain. Though we have more elected officials who were openly LGBT plus, post continue to work within the binds of conservative agendas and it still suffer great political violence. 
Finally, the recent recognition of equal pay of state (INAUDIBLE) for a--to LGBT plus partnerships is to be celebrated. But the lack of programs in support for the working and the young part is staggering. In particular, there is a heightened vulnerability for LGBT plus youth. Trans women and men of all ages, people living with disabilities and migrants considered undocumented who also identify as part of our community. 
So yes, there is still much work to be done and here we are doing it. It is a great privilege to be considered a pioneer LGBT plus leadership around the world. Although I couldn't have said this accept this award without acknowledging that we are here because of the courage of those before us, which we can't betray by accepting any of less than we deserve. I certainly feel there is possibility to continue holding power to account, to ensure we are not seeing this place holders for diversity or as pawns for a so-called in conclusion that only includes a privileged few. 
To not--to not fall for easy corporate slogans or an ad on rainbow, but to really demand dignity as that standard and not an option. But beyond that, which is absolutely necessary, I believe I also have a responsibility to not let it feel so daunting, to make sure the path, incredibly--incredibly difficult as it may be, is also a celebration of the road less traveled. (UNTRANSLATED) 
I would like to dedicate this award to my father, Javier. (UNTRANSLATED) It's been almost a year without you here. (UNTRANSLATED) Because being a lone trailblazer feels scary, I'd like to extend this recognition to everyone here and ask that you also take on the responsibility with me. I hope you all can join me in that. I know it's a tough task, but like I said before, I am an optimist. Thank you very much. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Lucia. And also, congratulations to the award and it's amazing what kind of work that you do and it's so good to see that it is really appreciated and awarded in this conference. 
Hello, everyone. My name is Marc Berthold. I am the head of the division of the European Union in North America at the Heinrich Boll Foundation in Germany. I'm chairing this coming session from Berlin and I'm really honored that I was invited to do this and we'll talk with guests and I welcome you all to the plenary challenging democracies, the pandemic, and its influence on human rights. We will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on all our countries from where we are, from where you are watching, with our societies and on our democracies. 
We talk about worrying trends and how we can combat COVID-19, misinformation, and also the weaponization of the pandemic to weaken rights and protections. But before I introduce our panelists, we have a word from two of our sponsors, Pharma and Pfizer. Thank you again, Pharma and Pfizer for your support and sponsoring this conference and we start with a short video greeting from Pharma. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
UNKNOWN: So much our world has changed due to COVID-19, but one thing that hasn't, the innovations in medicine that help us live longer, healthier lives. The system that creates them is essential, but it's not always easy to understand. Let's take a closer look. 
America's best scientists work together and labs at biopharmaceutical companies, research hospitals, and the National Institutes of Health collaborating all the time in the best research and development ecosystem in the world. So how does it all work? Because they before they even have an idea for a medicine, scientists are busy learning more about the human body. 
Most of this research happens at universities and other institutions, but biopharmaceutical companies play an important role too. They all work to identify health needs, conduct basic research, and share knowledge. They are also looking for clues that can lead to treatments for complex diseases, like Alzheimer's. If a clue is found, then scientists across the ecosystem work on turning it into an idea for a new medicine. And if an idea has enough potential, it heads into research and development. 
R and D is how these ideas are transformed into potential new medicines. Sounds simple, right? Not quite. R and D is an area where biopharmaceutical companies shine, but it's still a challenge. Out of 10,000 potential new medicines, only one will actually make it to patients. And on average, it takes 10 to 15 years and $2.6 billion of R and D to produce a single medicine. 
Why? One reason is clinical trials that are lengthy and time consuming, but worth it. To confirm better drug is safe and effective, biopharmaceutical companies conduct multiple phases of trials. It involves years of collaboration with doctors, nurses, and patient volunteers with oversight from the FDA. If the trials are successful, medicines move on to FDA review, but there are no guarantees. 
From start to finish, only 12 percent of medicines that enter clinical trials or ultimately approved. The process for making these new medicines requires both expertise and innovation. In areas like cell and gene therapies, manufacturing processes are as advanced as the medicines themselves with strict requirements and high standards. Once these medicines are finally made, companies can deliver them to where they are needed. 
We've seen how private and public partners can come together to fight common enemies like HIV and cancer and unique roles that each plays. It's a complex system, but one that's made America the leader in delivering treatment, vaccines, and cures, which is why preserving this system is more important than ever. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
BERTHOLD: Thank you again, Pharma. Please accept our great appreciation and gratitude to support this conference. I would now like to introduce our next sponsor, Pfizer. Please welcome Mr. Ed Harnaga, vice president and head of Reputation, Policy, and Research and Development Communications. Please, Mr. Harnaga. 
HARNAGA: Great. Thank you, Marc. Hi. I'm pleased to be here not just representing Pfizer, but also as a proud member of the Victory Campaign Board. I'm honored to be here today to introduce the panel on pandemic--the pandemic and its influences on human rights. 
You know, went--when the pandemic first hit, Pfizer launched a five point plan that was focused on unprecedented collaboration and harnessing our resources to do everything we could to battle this pandemic. Shortly after that, we initiated a partnership with a small biotech company called BioNTech to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. We focused on moving at that speed of science while always putting patients safety first. 
And 248 days later, we submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization. And just this Wednesday, our vaccine was approved for temporary use in the United Kingdom marking the first approval of the vaccine and we are eagerly awaiting decisions from FDA and other regulators around the world. 
Today, we are intensely focused on our manufacturing efforts and ensuring proper distribution of the vaccine once it's approved. Pfizer is firmly committed to equitable and affordable access for COVID-19 vaccines for all people around the world. The company believes that collective responsibility calls for a highly coordinated and collaborative action by public and private stakeholders alike to end this pandemic. And Pfizer is also exploring opportunities to work with the COVAX facility, a mechanism established by Gavi, CEPI, and the World Health Organization that aims to ensure all countries, regardless of income levels, will have equal access to vaccines once they are approved. 
So let me close on a note of hope. Around this same time that the pandemic hit, Pfizer launched a campaign centered around a simple premise. Science will win. We did this because we believed that whether from our labs or labs around the world, science would find a way to end this pandemic. Today with multiple vaccines and new treatments on the horizon, we can finally see that hope is in fact on the way. 
So thank you for joining us for what I'm sure will be a thought provoking discussion. So let me hand it back over to our moderator, Mark, to get things started. Mark? 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Ed. Thank you so much. And chairing this plenary session tonight from Berlin, I have to tell you, Pfizer and BioNTech have been on the news quite a bit and we've been really--it's been really exciting to see what you've been achieve--able to achieve in this short period of time and so we are hoping that this vaccine gets around the world quickly so that this pandemic takes a different course in the coming year. So thank you again. 
HARNAGA: Thank you. 
BERTHOLD: And now I'm--it's my great honor to introduce to you U.S. Representative and co-chair of the LGBTQ House Equality Caucus, Congressman David Cicilline. He represents Rhode Island's first district--district and previously served as mayor of Providence where he was the first openly gay mayor of the U.S. state capital. Mr. Cicilline, David, we are looking forward to your remarks. Thank you so much. 
CICILLINE: Thank you, Marc. It's great to be back at the International LGBTQ Leaders Conference. Thank you to the Victory Institute for all of your great work and, in particular, for convening this virtual conference. 
In the midst of the holiday season, I'm so grateful for this global group of LGBTQ leaders blazing new trails from Brazil to South Bend. As the most senior gate member of the Democratic caucus and Co-chair of the equality caucus, it's been gratifying to see the increase in LGBTQ members in the House of Representatives overtime. And the incoming LGBTQ members who will join us in January are only going to add to the great roster of leaders here in the House. 
But at the same time, the ever present sense of the COVID-19 pandemic has touched all of us. Those of us working from empty offices, at home, or in countries around the world where the pandemic has dramatically worsened human rights. At a time when we might hope that we could all come together around common purpose of fighting this disease, instead, leaders have taken the opportunity to clamp down on protests, increase surveillance, and quiet dissent. 
On every continent, people face authoritarian leaders who are using this crisis to bolster their own hold on power and I include the United States in that group. The United States has also seen the power we have in the world stage, what Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State designee reminded us recently is the power of our example as a Democratic society. We have a leader who looks dangerously like some of the dictators we fought against and we have eroded the power of multilateral institutions that are our best hope for tackling the biggest problems of our lifetimes, climate change, human rights erosions, and pandemics. 
I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to 2021. The United States has a lot of work to do to prepare repair out relationships around the world, but we can do it and we will do it. We must continue to be both example to ourselves of robust of robust human rights and to push for those rights for the LGBTQ community in other groups everywhere. 
This includes passing the Equality Act, which I was proud to introduce and helped pass out of the House this Congress. It's time for the United States to lead the way in demonstrating our commitment to LGBTQ rights and human rights at home and abroad. I look forward to the conversation among our distinguished panelists. Thank you again for having me and enjoy the balance of the conference. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you so much, Congressman Cicilline. We are looking forward to, on that respect, to the year 2021 as well also from Europe and we want to do our share to rebuild this transatlantic alliance and I think we are already starting behind the--in the vaccines and during the transition and we're looking forward to that. 
But this year will continue to be a very difficult time. Like this year, we don't know where the pandemic will go and since last year started very different from what we expected, this January country by country has been affected by COVID-19. It shook the world, intensified already enormous inequalities. It has been challenging our health care systems, and has been increasing political and social unrest, not only in the U.S., but in many countries around the world. 
With economies struggling, unemployment rising, and strict lockdowns in many countries exonerating accelerating societal and psychological tensions, there have also been attempts to spread to denial of the pandemic entirely as well as misinformation about the reality of COVID-19, its treatments, and also the help of coming vaccines. In some countries, there were also attempts by elected officials or even entire governments to undermine Democratic institutions and turn back hard fought victories for the LGBT community in many countries as well, as well as women's rights. 
So tonight, or this afternoon for many of you, with three LGBT leaders from Brazil, Peru, and the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, I would like to discuss these worrying trends, but also how we can combat this misinformation around COVID-19 and the weaponization of the pandemic to weaken rights and protections politically vulnerable groups, including LGBTQ in our societies. 
Please welcome with me Dr. Rachel Levine. She is Secretary of Health for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Penn State College of Medicine. Second, I welcome Deputy Fabio Felix. He is state legislature of the federal district in Brazil. But besides that, he is a social worker and an LGBT activist and has a PhD in political science. 
And thirdly, I welcome Congressman Alberto de Belaunde. He is a member of the Peruvian Congress and one of two openly LGBTQ congressman in Peru. Alberto de Belaunde is a constitutional lawyer and University professor and an author. So with this, welcome you all and looking forward to our discussion and I give the word to Dr. Levine for her opening statement. 
LEVINE: Well, thank you very much. It's really an honor to be here. COVID-19 is certainly the biggest public health threat that we have faced globally, in the United States, and of course in Pennsylvania. COVID-19 effects everyone and also impacts our families, our communities, and really the entire world. 
And what this virus has clearly shown us is how interconnected we all are. It has also shown the true health disparities that continue to exist in our health care system in Pennsylvania and in the United States. In Pennsylvania, we have announced a health disparity task force to address the unique needs of Pennsylvania's vulnerable populations, especially in--with COVID-19, including our LGBTQ community. 
We know that this virus impacts minority and vulnerable communities differently, which is why we are working to make improvements to the way that we collect data that can inform a public policy decisions and drive healthcare delivery and improve population health. We are working to collect racial data, ethnic data in terms of our laboratories, and we are really the only state in the United States that is collecting SOGI data, or Sexual Orientation Gender Identity data to make sure that everyone is--is counted in terms of their vulnerability to COVID-19. 
We also have taken steps to ensure everyone in Pennsylvania who might be experiencing symptoms have access to testing. All of us deserve access to care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuing to work with communities across Pennsylvania to engage with them and connect them with nonprofits and other organizations to keep this dialogue going. 
COVID-19 has certainly changed the way Pennsylvanians connect and support one another. We all play significant roles in keeping our community safe and we really need to foster a spirit--a spirit of acceptance and welcoming to everyone, regardless--regardless of any of our diversity to create better health outcomes for everyone. Thank you. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you very much, Dr. Levine. I would like to directly move it over to Fabio Felix. The words are yours. 
FELIX: First of all, I'd like to thank you guys for the invitation to talk about our situation here in Brazil. We know that everyone all around the world is facing a difficult time with coronavirus and the doubts about this pandemic crisis and its consequences. I'm honored to be part one more of Victory's Institute events, the organization that we respect so much from here, Brazil. As an LGBT state legislature, I'm really happy to be here today with you. 
Brazil is internationally recognized as unequal nation. According to data from the governments (INAUDIBLE) Institute, we are today the 90th country in the world in terms of inequality. In the last 7 years alone, the number of Brazilian people leaving in a state of poverty has increased from 6.5 percent to 13.5 percent of the population. In this already alarming scenario with the COVID-19 pandemic and social and economic impact, the really--the reality of Brazilians was hit hard with more severely--severely for those unemployed and in poverty. 
Approximately 28.6 million people has restricted access to the labor market during the beginning of social isolation in Brazil according to our organization, for example. There are millions of people who aren't employed and are unable to meet their needs. Also, our president became known as--known as an ally of COVID-19 coronavirus instead of joining (INAUDIBLE) to flatten the curve, he worked against social distance policies every day. 
He has attacked doctors and scientists who advocate for preventative measures and boycott governors who (INAUDIBLE) quarantine here. Despite everything, we had this year municipal elections and Bolsonaro was defeated. So we are happy here to discuss our situation now. Thank you. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you very much, Fabio. Now Alberto, you're next before we start the discussion. Thank you. 
DE BELAUNDE: Great. Thank you for the opportunity once again. The lockdown in Peru started on March 16, before the UK and some other European countries and continued until the end of June. This made it one of the longest lockdowns in the world. The country's borders were shut, curfews were imposed, and people could leave their homes for essential goods only. 
But infections and death continued to rise. We were one of the hardest hit countries in the world by COVID-19. Peru's healthcare system was under prepared, leading to more death but several other social and economic factors can help explain the current situation. 
Right now, we have approximately 1 million cases and the official record shows 36,000 deaths. But the thing is that there's an under reporting of the death and people say--journalists say that this number is considerably higher. At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a narrative in the media that said the following. This is a Democratic virus because it affects us all equally. That of course was not true. 
The pandemic has made inequality's more evident and made the vulnerable more vulnerable. About 70 percent of employed population in Peru work in the informal sector, which is one of the highest rates in Latin America. In Peru, between 7 and 8 million Peruvian still don't have direct access to clean drinking water. 
The latest national household survey suggests that 11 percent of poor households in Peru live in overcrowded homes. So it's not true that this affects everyone by the same. And of course, it's not true also for the LGBT community. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you very much, Alberto. Thank all of you for your introductory statements. I would like to stick a little bit with the current situations in your countries as we go into the winter and many countries, again, are going into it lockdown and address--all of you addressed inequality's in your societies, in your communities and I have two questions. 
What are the current measures that your governments are taking at the moment looking ahead into this winter? But also, how are--is the population, your society actually able to follow the rules? Just giving one example from Germany, we are advised to be--to work from home, which I, in a privileged position, can actually do. That's why I'm also at the moment in this conference, but many people don't have that choice. 
So they have to use public transportation, if they have work, or they have to look for work so they have to be out there. So I--if you can--if you can describe a little bit what's the situation in your countries? And I would like to store it with Fabio again from Brazil. 
FELIX: Okay. Thank you. We--we are in a very critical situation now because we had once--one emergency aid that one of the results of the popular pressure was the conquest of the emergency aid paid by the federal government to guarantee the minimum rights to this vulnerable population. It started to be offered only from April, but now it's get--it's going to get finished. So it's a problem for us. 
We are next to the summer now so for us here, down here, December, January and February, summer. So we are going to have a lot of travel around the country. We are in a big country, so it's going to be a problem for--for us because we're going to have more agglomeration, so it's going to be a problem for the social distance. So we're really worried about that. 
We have federal government that--president that denied the crisis, the pandemic, so it's--it's still a problem and we have some local governors that don't want to take any--any measures now because they're worried about the economy. So that's a big problem we are going to face now. So we have more than 6 million people that were already had the coronavirus and we also had more than 175,000 people that--deaths. 1,000 deaths here in Brazil. 
So it's a problem too for--a big problem for us. So we are really worried. And as a legislator, I'm worried about that and, more than that, we are working for the governor--local governor, our governor to do something about that. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you. I apologize for my geography skills. I did put the equator not where it's actually is. Rachel, Dr. Levine, how do you--how is the situation in Pennsylvania right now and also, looking at the holidays that many people would celebrate in a few weeks and how--how are the details on the ground right now and how people--how are people accepting the rules? Are they following the recommendations that you're giving? 
LEVINE: So we are very challenged right now in Pennsylvania in the--in the United States. Really, the entire country, according--in addition to our state is in the middle of our fall into--and winter resurgence, so we're seeing increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19, increasing hospitalizations, and tragically, increasing deaths. 
In the United States, there are over 14 million cases of COVID-19, more than 276,000 deaths, and there were 216,000 new cases yesterday alone and almost 3,000 deaths yesterday alone in the United States. Pennsylvania is following that--that trend as well. And so, you know, there are three ways for the--to deal with the pandemic. 
One is containment, which involves testing and contact tracing with isolation and quarantine. The second is mitigation measures like wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands, as well as limitations on gatherings, et cetera. 
And then the third is the development of a vaccine, which really is a light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you to Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies for their--their amazing work in terms of the development of these vaccines. But it's going to take time to distribute vaccines. I think the public is pretty split. 
I think that, unfortunately, the pandemic has been politicized in the United States, even though we're past our election, it continues to be politicized. And I think that much of the population is agreeing to comply with our recommendations, but there is a large enough segment of the population that isn't, which is making things even more challenging in the United States and in Pennsylvania. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Rachel. Alberto, how about Peru is--at this moment in time and where do you see how are people struggling following to follow the regulations? What are the measures? 
DE BELAUNDE: The thing is--the thing is we are not asking ourselves if we are going to have a second wave. We are just asking ourselves when is going to hit the second wave. We have a pretty dramatic situation with the first one. If you see that national data, it's not a--you can see like a big wave, but if you see closer, you see that there were like small waves through the country with different rhythm in different regions. 
And the thing is, we are starting to see this new wave in the north of the country. So we don't know if it's only going to stay there or if we were going to have the same experience that we had in March and April. The thing is that the lockdown we had was also a complete economic shutdown and that--this hit it pretty hard, the economy in Peru and of course, it hit pretty hard the family economy for every Peruvian. 
So we are--we cannot go back to another national lockdown like the one we had in March till June because the economy in the country is not in a good position for doing that. So we are really worried about that and also, I want to--to talk about the LGBTQ community during this crisis. The thing is that in Peru, we don't have a marriage equality or a civil union laws. We don't have gender identity law or a strong anti-discrimination system. So LGBTQ people in Peru are always in a more vulnerable situation than other people, straight people. 
So, they're particular vulnerable in this situation. I know of cate--cases of--of people that--that lost their partner due to COVID and they--they didn't have any legal recognition so they ended up losing everything, because they were not legally recognized as the other person's legal partner. 
So, or they--we had this strange system during lockdown where a government allows a woman to leave the house to--to go make some grocery shopping on one day and allows men to the same on other days. So, we had a lot of problems with discrimination against trans people in the--in that experiment we had during lockdown. So, when I try just to say that always in this hard a city situations people that are already you know, weren't level space, make themselves even more vulnerable and we are not a--addressing mis-issues (PH) in government because of the homophobia and transphobia that is still in place in Peruvian politics. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Alberto. We just as the (INAUDIBLE) Foundation we recently also had a discussion about the similar challenges in Turkey, where a lot of safe spaces have been closed and so there is nowhere to go. And, it also affects trans people, but it affects workers and--but--and similar just people that are not in relationships. And that, you know, and they are lonely and then don't--don't have a place to go. Do you see--how much do you see that in Brazil or in--in the United States as well, Fabio and Rachel? 
FELIX: I think it's--we are worried about the way our governors, in general, is taking the directions of measures. Because it's not enough for you to--to do the isolation or to--to tell the population should be desolation if you can't do anything else to help the people. So, that's a problem. When you think about for example, when you think about LGBT population, we have problems here, because we know as LGBTQ people that we--we are not always safe at home. 
So, when you're--you're--you're telling people to stay at home, stay at home, you're not guaranteeing the conditions for safer, for you know, mental health and everything. So, it's--it's a problem, especially for an LGBTQ people. So, we are worried about that here too in Brazil and we are worried that our--our governors do nothing else because as I said we are concerned about the second wave and we do not trust every time you know our governors to do something. So, it's a problem, a very big problem now. 
BERTHOLD: Our LGBTI organizations at the moment to where I get to work is part of that care is that happening online to be available there, is that happening? Fabio? 
FELIX: I'm sorry? 
BERTHOLD: Sorry, I'm sorry, I was--since you mentioned that how people that I would stay that home and that are lonely or that actually are at risk? I mean you have also LGBTI two organizations, non-government, are they able to work at the moment, or like to be available online maybe? Just--or is that-- 
FELIX: We--we have--we have some work here but some LGBTQ organizations but it's not--it's not enough, you know. We have a very weak organizations here for this type of work. We have a big parade, big movements, but we have a problem with the organization to help people. LGBTQ organizations are not prepared to help people, to give some assistance. So, I--I think it's like a problem for us, today. And, we--we do not have in the state, organizations, or social policies for that. 
So, that's a problem too, because we don't have institutions to assist LGBTQ people that need, so we--we do not have shelters, we do not have a telephone like you said, to called here in our chamber. We create a number for people to report some problems and we are trying to help, but it's, we can't do everything. You know, so it's a one initiative but it's not enough for the--the--the size of our problem. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Fabio. Rachel, how do you assess the situation in your state of Pennsylvania or in the United States regarding the LGBT community and ways to support? Which you might actually do as a Secretary of Health. 
LEVINE: I think it is variable in the United States so that there is no nationwide nondiscrimination legislation that includes sexual and gender minorities, in the United States. There are many states that do. So, for example, California, New York, and Massachusetts, etc. But many states do not have comprehensive non-discrimination legislation. In fact, Pennsylvania is the only state in the northeast that does not have comprehensive nondiscrimination statutes that include sexual and gender minorities. 
So, I--it is very variable. As in--as in Brazil and in Peru, I mean I think the impacts of isolation are thought--are felt very significantly by the LGBTQ population and individuals. There are opportunities to have online, you know, discussions and groups, etc. But it's not exactly the same; not everyone has access to broadband. Especially, in some rural areas of Pennsylvania. So, there are disparities in terms of that. and, I think it is particularly challenging for certain groups. 
For instance, in schools you know, there's a lot of social services that young people get in schools and so there are many schools throughout Pennsylvania and in the United States that are that are on remote learning. But the teachers and the other staff don't have access to the students and can see for instance if there's child abuse. So, child abuse reports have gone down; that's not because child abuse is going down, it's because you know many, many, teachers and other people who would see it are not seeing it and can't report it. 
So, I think that for LGBTQ seniors, for LGBTQ youth, it is--it is particularly difficult. It's also difficult in the healthcare sector you know, we do have marriage equality but again there are discrimination practices, so many LGBTQ individuals especially trans individuals, don't feel comfortable being out to their medical providers, feel uncomfortable going to emergency departments, etc. 
And so, and so, if you're sick with COVID or another medical condition that can lead to further health care disparities. So, I think it is a challenge despite many of the advances that the United States has, there are still a lot of challenges for LGBTQ individuals and those are just exacerbated with COVID-19. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Rachel. you mentioned earlier also the politicization of the pandemic and looking from Europe we saw I mean that actually governments like Turkey and Poland for example they used this moment of pandemic actually too announce that they want to leave the Istanbul convention on preventing violence against women, or Hungary and Poland specifically targeting also the LGBTI community. In these times, not necessarily connecting it to the pandemic but using the shadows of the pandemic to tighten or to attack the rule of law and minority rights. And, do you see any of that in your--in your countries? 
LEVINE: Well-- 
BERTHOLD: Specifically addressed, also the LGBTI community by politicians or governments? Rachel? 
LEVINE: So, in the United States there has been significant politicization of the--of the pandemic, which I think has limited the public health response. I think it has hindered the public health response. For some reason wearing a mask has become a political statement. And, I think that that has been very challenging because many people are quote-unquote expressing their personal freedom by not taking basic public health actions - wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing, and avoiding large and small gatherings. 
And, I think that is true really throughout the United States. Of course, more in certain states than in other states. I think that the pandemic was a big issue in the election, and I think you know many countries are aware of our--of our presidential election. but there was a general election and we had you know, representatives to Congress chosen and senators and we also had local representatives chosen, really throughout the United States. 
Where my--my message has been is as I said that--that the virus has shown how interconnected we are. And, in the United States, we are blessed with a lot of freedoms, but you know to me freedom comes with responsibility. And, that's--that's not a new concept; that's really since the beginning of our Republic. And, that there is a personal responsibility to work towards the common good, a collective responsibility to work towards the common good. 
And, to take simple public health measures to protect you know, ourselves as individuals, our families, and our communities. And so, I--I think that wearing a mask is not a demonstration of personal responsibility, it's an aggregation of someone's responsibility. And so, you know, we are trying to get that message across in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States, but it is a challenge. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Rachel. Alberto, do you see privatization of that kind in Peru as well? Specifically, towards vulnerable groups? You're muted. 
DE BELAUNDE: Yes. Sorry. There's no politicization of the scientific answer to--to--to the COVID-19 crisis. We all use a mask; we all have a--we all know we have to wash our hands. We have not seen a movement like that one that we see in the states. But the thing is, that there's half politically, a political use of this crisis for the populist politicians in Congress. The thing is this Congress was elected in January and it started working when the pandemic was already in the country. 
When we were in lockdown. So, we--we are having all decisions in through Microsoft Teams or Zoom. And, the thing is 90 percent of Congressmen and women were elected for the first time to Congress. 90 percent! I'm one of the old, wise, guys with two terms experience. 
(LAUGHTER) 
That's not a lot. Bad thing is a lot of them are there for the first time, and they feel like that this crisis is like the opportunity to move a populist agenda, an economic populist agenda in Congress 'cause we are in this, a really challenging times. And, the thing is, in Peru, we have a really strong and surprising economic growth this last 20 years because we were really responsible with the economy. 
And now a lot of this like a--a lot of these agreements we had about the economy are being challenged by Congress. So, it's really a difficult to debate and to try to preserve a lot of these economic values, in this difficult times, because the narrative build is around this kind of initiatives are always, we are with the people. We are with persons that are suffering, and you only care about the economy like this, not a tangible thing, like this theoretical concept. So, it's really hard to--to have a serious debate about economic issues in this kind of environment. 
BERTHOLD: But you also had, Peru also had the government crisis in the--just in the last few weeks, right? Is that connected or is it over, or what's the current state of that, and how does it relate to the COVID pandemic in your country? 
DE BELAUNDE: Well, I--I think we have this political instability before the pandemic. But the thing is obviously the pandemic make it even more difficult to--to solve it. And, we have had 3 presidents in the last month. So, you--you can imagine the--the next time you will be. Now I think we are in a--in a path to a civil transition into 3 elections, but of course, this was one of the elements that--that trigger this--this crisis. 
We have a really weak political system; we have like 20 political parties. They are not political parties; they're more like electoral movements around a leader. So, we have three years of a lot of political instability, that ended up in this big crisis, this last month. But of course, the COVID-19 pandemic had a lot to do and it was one of the main reasons we have this--this crisis of the--the, in these times. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Alberto. Fabio, President Bolsonaro he was like in the first wave--in the beginning of the pandemic, he was internationally known as one of those who was in denial and then he caught COVID-19 in himself. And, how is the situation right now, in the country? Also, from--from the governmental side but also maybe in the different regions, is it politicizes still or? 
FELIX: Yeah and when you talked about the politicization of pandemic, I remembered about Bolsonaro, because that's our main problem here today. Bolsonaro describes himself like a friend of President Trump, that's how he describes himself. So, you know, how Trump leads with the pandemic and it's really similar to how Bolsonaro leads with the pandemic. So, every day he has a public event and he's not wearing masks. 
So, he does not give the examples for the--for the people about the mask. So, it's--it's a big problem we have over here. He has assisted that quarantine is an effective cure for--for COVID-19. And, he's not a doctor. He doesn't understand about that. He has fired two health ministries during the crisis. So, it's our big problem. Even today, because now he--he keeps on saying that's just the flu. It's not a pandemic, is not so. 
It's not--we have--not--we do not have to work--worry about that, so it's not a big problem. And, the politicization is a big problem for us, he's not radical of Red Wing (PH) our president today and we are having to respond with the science--scientific community, with the doctors, to respond every day to tell people that we have to be careful. We have to wash our hands. We have to wear masks. 
People are wearing masks, we have today a command for--for our nation about that, because the Congress deliberated about that, and the governors did that. But now--not our president. So, the president is the main problem for--for COVID-19 today. We--we say that he's an ally for coronavirus in Brazil. 
BERTHOLD: Still, up to today, wow. In Germany compared to other countries in the European Union, Germany has done relatively well. And now, we are in a second lockdown, well light, I mean only (INAUDIBLE) are closed, but schools are open. We can leave your apartments. We can commute and work. But the government has tried to do fairly well and to be responsible. And, but there is a growing resistance, and it's still a minority in Germany, but there's a growing resistance out of the population. 
And--and also, and the question is like with disinformation coming from the Internet, people that don't want to believe because they don't know anyone that might be affected in their direct environments. And, that are kind of like refusing to wear masks now. So, there is this kind of politicization out of civil society. And, in Germany, if you look at the polls--political party polls there's no party that can actually benefit from that. 
Most people are really responsible but the medias gives this very high attention. And so, the government feels the pressure to act on easing rules, because there is this sense of--there is this big resistance that the polls actually don't show, that 70-80 percent in Germany actually approve of their--of the safety measures and everything. Do you see that in return, as well? Rachel, is that also like a bunch of kind of refusal, do you see that? 
LEVINE: I think that it is. I mean, I think it is often a populist type of movement, but I think it has been cultivated by--by certain political figures, for their own political gains. So, I--I think actually there is a populist movement as there might be in Germany. There's a lot--a lot of social media which is misinformation, as you've been saying. 
But I think that that has again, has been cultivated especially during the election, by certain political figures, both nationally and in--and in Pennsylvania, with this idea of almost civil unrest and civil disobedience, that they're not--that it's a personal freedom issue and they're not going to obey mask-wearing mandates. That they're not going to stay at home, that they're not going to agree to restaurant limitations or anything like that. 
So, we're dealing with that misinformation. I think that that's going to be a really important issue as we approached our vaccinations. So, as was said at the beginning of the--at the beginning of the conference you know, the--the Pfizer vaccine will be coming out first, going to the FDA on December 10th. We are hoping that it gets its emergency use authorization and we'll be able to distribute a week or so later, to hospitals and to nursing homes. 
And then, there's another vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, which would be about a week later and so we have two vaccines which we hope will be deemed safe and effective but there's a lot of misinformation about vaccines. And, I think that again certain political figures are going to--are going to ride off that. So, something that public health is going to have to work on. 
BERTHOLD: What role do you see the media playing in the United States? Is it playing a role or is it more on the Internet and information that people gather themselves? 
LEVINE: I think the Internet is--is--is the most easy way to distribute misinformation, whether it's coming from popular sources or from political sources. So, that would include Twitter obviously, certain political figures have made Twitter sort of a life choice. And, that would include Facebook and many other media that I'm too old to even know about. But I think that the--that the general media, particularly television, has also fed on that. And, I think there has been attempts to try to truth speak, by certain people in the media. But there are other media channels that feed into this misinformation. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Rachel. Alberto, you said earlier that actually the population in people is following the rules at--if they can mostly wearing the masks. Do you see still like are there pockets of resistance or is there just the government feel under pressure to--to respond to certain resistance of that kind? 
DE BELAUNDE: The thing is I think that that the main concern right now is the economic crisis. They remember that 70 percent of employed population in Peru works in the informal sector and--and--and that really notice when--when you try to--to--to put some measure to put some rules for economic activities, we are an informal economy. So, it's really hard for government to endorse those kinds of rules. And also, there's a lot of pressure of some of the economic activities that are is still say, prohibited. 
For example, the other day there was this a--this a really big report on TV about the casinos that are still closed. And, you know this obviously, this was part of a casino lobby to try to open 'cause believe me nobody cares about the casinos right now, 'cause we have a lot of other problems to solve. But there's a lot of pressure from some economic sectors to--to try to--to open even though there are some activities that are still prohibited. 
We have also a--a very serious problem of fake news on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, they we don't have a really big anti-vax movement. Fortunately. But there--there--there's--there's still a really strong campaign against this a vaccine and that is really--that worries me because we really need to for people to--to really engage in this--in this process if we want to--to end this COVID crisis. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Alberto. Germany, we do have publicly funded TV and radio and they have been defunded, they're not state-owned, they're just publicly funded by the society. But they try to, I mean, they really, they play a role, lots of kind of like science-based information to give discussions too. And, since the government is doing the same, there is no big shift between the public media and the government, by those misses--by those people that don't like the rules that didn't--the deniers. 
They attack our media--this kind of media as kind of like they are the state media and there were undemocratic. So, Fabio coming to you, in like in the country where the government is among those who are denying or downplaying the--the pandemic what is the role of the media in Brazil then, at the moment? 
FELIX: Yeah, the media here have tried to do the right thing. They--they--they kept--they told the people about what coronavirus was the measures that were necessary to prevent. They try to--to play a good a good role in this pandemic. So, I have to say that, recognize that. And also, we have 27 governors here, and beyond the president. So, we have 27 states. And, the governors and health secretaries of each state, they try to coordinate their actions and measures, despite the president's actions and despite the president's thoughts about the virus. 
So, it helped a little and we have something happening to--to try to prevent and we also have to thank our public system of health, so our health public system was really important for this process. If Brazil did not have a public system for health, we--we would be in a very, very, worst place today. So, we have to remember that our--the--the place of the states, the importance of the state in this--in this matter to prevent and to assist people with the help--the health problems. So, at something important for us and the media played a good role in this pandemic. 
BERTHOLD: Okay. And what do-- 
FELIX: Disinformation and fake news, and Twitter, Facebook, and other networks, we have the fake news about the origin of the virus and about vaccines. Now, we have some movements do we're not vaccine, they will not vaccine because they--they say that the vaccine, has a chip or something like that. They are spreading things like that, but it's not something that we are worried because we know that it people--people believe in the vaccine. 
We have the national vaccine policies they--that our vaccine policies that they work, so we think that it's not going to be something relevant. But we have some movements, against vaccine in here because of that disinformation and fake news. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you. Interesting enough and in Germany, Twitter is actually not one of the big drivers against these people--the corona deniers. It's more telegram as a messaging service like something like WhatsApp, I don't know how popular it is in your countries. But in there it's really being shared widely. 
The question is what are governments able to do to counter this misinformation? Fabio, you mentioned that you're in the states or like the regional governors in Brazil are trying to do the right thing. How do they do it? How do they reach the population with the information? 
FELIX: They tried, right here in Brazil for example they tried, at the beginning of the crisis, but now as Alberto said, they are more worried about the economic crisis, and not about the health crisis now; so that's a problem. We know that the economic consequences are really, really, difficult. We're going to have a very difficult time next year, for everyone. But we have to prevent (INAUDIBLE) because we can get the jobs again, but we cannot get the lives again. 
So, that's--that's why we are worried here. And, very worried about that. And, our governors did the right thing at the beginning of the crisis but now we are next to a second wave. And, I know it's like second wave or it's the continuously, what about what was happening, but it's now a second wave as the media says. And, the second wave that the governors do not want to do anything else, really restricts things and guide the population. So, we are worried. Really worried about that. 
And, but they--they tried something, and the media tried something, but it was not enough. We have a lot of disinformation. I think that WhatsApp and Facebook tried to mark some--some posts that we're doing the wrong thing. They're trying to pursue the fake news, but I'm not the--to change them. But I'm not sure if that was enough because we have a lot of disinformation in society today, yet. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Fabio. Rachel what are you able to do as secretary of health to counter with your institution like this misinformation on the various channels and what are you doing to do that, how do you? 
LEVINE: Sure. I--I think that this global pandemic has highlighted the very important role of public health both locally, statewide, and nationally. And, public health, unfortunately, has been underfunded in the United States. I think it has fallen to--to local and state health officials to really work very, very, hard on these communication efforts, to counter misinformation, and to present scientifically sound information and guidance during this pandemic. 
This year, I am the president of ASTHO which is the Association of State and Territory Health Officials and so we have really been working with all of us, in all fifty states and seven territories to really get the message across, about sound scientific principles. And, how we can work to stem the spread of the virus and also how the public can do that. There have been national officials such as Dr. Fauci which people--people are very familiar with, who have also tried to do that. 
There--there have been other--other health officials as part of the administration which have not been as positive, but certainly Dr. Fauci has been a beacon in the United States. State health officials and local health officials have taken a lot of pushback from that. It's always a challenging position but many of us have had protests in front of our house, have had you know very, very, negative posts on social media. Some even threats, etc. And so, I think there has been a price to pay for sort of pushing back against that--that populist misinformation. 
BERTHOLD: It's really, I mean from a--from a perspective out of Germany that like this has become so personal, I mean that people come to people's houses, that sort of really--it's really shocking to see, you know. Alberto, how--what is the government doing or like to try and counter misinformation, or is that not such a big issue? 
DE BELAUNDE: One of the problems in government is that we didn't have like this really big communication campaign, that I think we needed. I--I think that a lot of the information that that people are getting are through the media or because they want to stay informed. And, that's a problem 'cause you need to have different kinds of information for kids, for elderly people, for people that are working, for people that are studying. And, we don't have that that kind of--of information campaigns. 
And, there's also--there's also an issue that really worries me, that's the vaccination campaign. We are--we are going to need this really big infrastructure for getting all the people in the whole country vaccinated. And, we're gonna need a lot of information of--of how and when people are gonna get vaccinated. And, I think that we don't have the--the kind of infrastructure and also the kind of strategy to make the--that thing possible. It is going to be a tremendous effort not only for a government but also for the private--private sector. 
BERTHOLD: Staying with that point, what do you think does the government need to do? And, what also would--what can the international community do or the regional alike, in your--in your in Latin America? How can you cooperate or how can you get support? What's from your perspective? Alberto, then we will go to Fabio to see. 
DE BELAUNDE: Yes. I--I think that it is going to be really necessary for the private sector and the public sector to work together. And, if they do have a lot of challenges because of their--of its geography. We have the high lands, you have the Amazonian jungle, and we also have a lot of infrastructure problems; some roads are not in a very good shape. And, the thing is we for--for the vaccine that is getting all the that--that the vaccine that we are going to--to implement here in Brazil, you need a really strong and secure process to get it to the people. 
Then you need--you need it to stay in certain degree and it's like a really complex product to manage in a country that don't have the infrastructure to guarantee that kind of--of operation. So, that's one of the--the main concerns right now. I think that we're going to need help from the international cooperation system but also from the private sector that--that have some process and infrastructure that the government--lack of. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you. Fabio, I assume in Brazil many of the challenges are similar to the size of the country and to the periphery, how--what are the plans of the government at the moment? How do you see or what--what would you ask of the government to do, if they haven't started yet? 
FELIX: Yeah, we are in the biggest country of lakes in America. So, it's a very big country. We have 27 states, many difference, regional difference in our country. And, difficult for--for the vaccine campaigns. But we have some know-how for vaccine campaign here; we have a public health system with a vaccine campaign, a permanent for some diseases, so it can help us. 
But our federal government is not helping and working off to get the vaccine, working to buy the vaccines here. So, we are worried about that and our federal health official, he's not a doctor or nurse, he doesn't know about health. He's a general of the army. And, he doesn't know the structures about the health. He doesn't know about the areas. So, we are worried about that to. And, they didn't stay tonight--last week about this week they--they made a statement about the vaccine campaign and we--we are really worried because the statement did not convince people it's gonna work. 
And, the people will be vaccines, so for--for the--for us to win the economic crisis, to win the pandemic, we have to--we need to have the vaccines here in Brazil. And, we go into fight for that and report the government, fighting the chambers, that's what we're doing now. But we're worried about the--the system. The organization of this process, because how can we trust in a government that deny the pandemics? So, that's our--the biggest problem now. 
BERTHOLD: I can imagine, Fabio. Rachel, I can imagine you are working day and night at the moment to plan and to the rollout of the--of the vaccination programs. Can you tell us about the preparations, about what are you going to do and what? 
LEVINE: So, you are correct, we have been working for months and months on the preparation for the distribution and administration of the vaccine. In the United States, it has been called Operation Warp Speed, based on Star Trek, I guess. And, you know, it looks like it's going to have been successful. I mean the goal was produced--to introduce vaccines that are safe and effective and can be distributed to the population. And so, given the approval of the FDA over the next several weeks the first vaccine again will be Pfizer, the second one Moderna. 
There are three phases of the rollout of the vaccine, which is going to take months and months you know, it might take six, nine months before the vaccine really gets to the gym--to the full general population and we were able to immunize everybody. The first stage will be for health care workers and for seniors in vulnerable long-term care living facilities, which have really worn the brunt of--of the--of the pandemic. 
Then other critical workers and other vulnerable populations will be vaccinated and then eventually the general population. So, we have very detailed plans for the rollout. And, you know Pennsylvania stands prepared to administer and distribute the vaccine when it's deemed available; hopefully, within the next 2 weeks. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you so much, Rachel. We have few more minutes before we start a closing round and I would like to come back to what all of your described are the economic challenges that are also, I mean, were happening already but were intensified or really magnified by the public pandemic. If you look into next year, where do you see the biggest risk for your countries? 
And, at this conference, there are so many international leaders that are in so many different positions, like highlighting the international need to cooperate, what would be your address those who are listening or watching us at the moment? And, will be on different panels later today or tomorrow. So, how--I will start with you Alberto, like economy-wise, where do you see--what is the biggest challenge of the rich sector or what do you need the government to do, and where does Peru also need to international cooperation on this? 
DE BELAUNDE: Where is--one of my main concerns is that we have national elections in April, so we are in half of our electoral process, through this a crisis. So, I'm really worried about that populist parties or the ones that are trying to--to use the--the people's frustration to get in power. I'm right now really worried about vulnerable communities especially LGBT communities. We don't have here in Peru like a big grassroots organization that take cares of people or give shelter. 
We have great LGBT organizations but they're more in like the activist front and not a very strong in the social net taking care of people area. So, I'm really worried about the LGBT communities especially trans people in Peru. And, I think that in the economy part of the equation, if we can keep the--the economic values that we have for 20 years and all the studies show that we can start seeing the recovery of the economy in the second part of next year. So, we can be an optimist. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you so much. Fabio, how is the situation in Brazil, the economy, and also employment wise into next year? 
FELIX: We have so many challenges for next year and lack of money, unemployment, economic crisis, increase of poverty, so we are worried about that. And, we think that we have to keep paying the emergency aid for people, who have some money to you know, to survive, to eat, so that's our problem, we have to face for, poverty. So, to face the poverty we have to keep paying people emergency aid. So, that's why we are so worried for next year. 
BERTHOLD: Thanks, Fabio. Rachel? 
LEVINE: Well, I think that it's a false choice between public health and the economy. You can't have a successful economy if the COVID-19 virus is just burning through your population. And, that has been seen in state by state. So, that in the states that have not taken some mitigation measures, the virus just burns. And, you can't have a successful economy. What we really need is for Congress to act and to have another CARES Act for economic relief to those most severely affected by the pandemic. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you so much, Rachel. I think this is, we have a few more minutes to wrap all of this up and just having listened to all of--each of you, I think it was about--it was a very rich discussion because it shows, as you said, one of you said in the very beginning, this pandemic and the crises that come with it affect everyone, but differently. And, it's really important I think that's what I really want to take away with it. 
Also too, for the rest of the conference, it doesn't affect everyone the same. I personally am in--I'm in a very privileged position because my job is fairly secure. I can work from home. Berlin is a city where I can do a lot by bike. I don't have to commute on public transportation, so I can reduce my risk. And, I don't have fears that many people that you described in your countries actually have because of unemployment, of different social status situations, vulnerabilities. 
Especially, as we talked about the LGBTI community but also from different like indigenous populations in your countries. there is so much that we need to be aware of. And, I think what I also as a share of tonight, I really--I appreciated that you shared and that you're connected the situations in your countries. Looking now as a somebody from Germany, we pride ourselves like--like being in the center of the European Union. I really look so rarely how other countries in our neighborhood are suffering from the pandemic, France or Austria or even the Netherlands. And, we actually don't look how they--not enough I should say, that we do look but not enough what they are doing to--to end this pandemic. And, to get out of it. 
And, there's so much national debate in Germany then I think this--a conference like this is also a big opportunity for people to learn from each other to live--by listening to you, but also time to talk to you. And, I would like to--with each of you and again, like an opportunity for like famous last words, where you see what you are taking away from this debate tonight. 
And, what you want our audience; we have hundreds of people watching from I think many places in the world actually. What they should know and how we can come together internationally? I think that's something that is important for us today also to take away. And, I do want to start with Rachel again. 
LEVINE: Thank you. As I again would like to bring up the issue of health equity and health care disparities. You know, think of it almost like an iceberg. So, we have now seen with COVID-19, how big the iceberg is. And, how many heath disparities are present in Pennsylvania and in the United States. That impact many vulnerable communities, vulnerable children, vulnerable seniors, minority communities, such as the African American community, the LatinX community, in--in Pennsylvania as well as the LGBTQ community. 
And, it highlights what are called the social determinants of health, the things that we don't usually think of as health issues. But to me, economic opportunity and a minimum wage, a living wage, is actually a health issue. Educational opportunity is a health issue. Nutrition, obviously the environment is a health issue, housing is a health issue, transportation is a health issue. And, we usually separate those, but we--in public health now we like to integrate those and say that really public health is in terms of all of these policies. 
Well, nothing has demonstrated that more than the impact of this global pandemic on--on--on our entire world, on the United States, and on Pennsylvania. So, we really have to come together, we have to stand united in order to defeat this virus. And, we--we need to demonstrate our personal and collective responsibility to each other, to our neighbors, our communities, our states, and our nation. And, I think if we do that, I'm a positive and optimistic person, and I think we'll be successful. Thank you. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you so much, Rachel. Fabio. 
FELIX: Oh, I want to thank you for the opportunity, the invitation to be here with you guys today. And, we have a long path to go here in Brazil, towards the full respect for human rights and democracy. But this pandemic has shown us that solidarity must prevail. And, that hate politics is not only bad for women, for LGBTQ people, for black people, but for the whole country. 
It's my hope that this will be the conclusion of the vast majority of Brazilians once again in two years when we will hold the nation elections. We will defeat hate once again. I am confident about that and I hope that the next year we have a better year. And, we're going to pressure the governors to do the right thing--right thing. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you, Fabio. Alberto. 
DE BELAUNDE: Yes, I think it's important to--to remember the origin of COVID-19. Science tells us that the origin of this pandemic is zoonotic, in other words, is the fault of the irresponsible way in which human beings related to nature. It is important to remember this in the face of what will mean the main challenge of our young generation, climate change. We need to act globally with the urgency and the speed with which we are acting against COVID. 
Because if we think this is a big crisis, the crises that are starting to happen all around the world because of climate change, is much, much, worse. So, I think that that we need to reevaluate how are we acting globally against climate change. 
BERTHOLD: Thank you so much. All three of you touched upon very important issues that I actually are also very moving, the connectedness, the outlook, the hope to come together as human beings and to bring it, to put it in the bigger context also, on climate change on this planet. All of it is indeed connected. At this moment, I really, really, thank you for your participation. It was a pleasure meeting you and discussing with you and hearing from you, your--your--your stories but also the situation in your countries. 
I do hope that we come together and find ways to cooperate on this. Also, I do want to thank the organizers of this at Victory Institute again, for this amazing conference. And, the sponsors also, pharma and Pfizer who actually are at the center of the way out of this pandemic. And, I wish all of us that they are successful in that whether we all come together and that the vaccines will work in the end because I think until then, we have these difficult situations of lockdowns and restrictions. 
Thank you all. I wish all viewers thank you for joining us today and yes, bye-bye. And, have a good afternoon in the U.S. and an evening in Europe or from wherever you are watching. Thank you so much.

[*]COHEN: Can you hear me, Mike? 
JOHNSON: (OFF MIC) 
COHEN: Great! Thank you, Mike. I want to start this session with a prayer. 
Dear God, we find ourselves in very trying times in this country and we would ask that those who are sick, heal them. Those who have lost loved ones, you give them hope, and faith, and solace. Those who have lost their jobs or their well-being, that don't have nutrition or--or opportunities to take care of their families, give them faith that we will get through this, times will be better. 
And to the police, give them the fortitude to carry on. Put peace in all of their hearts. And put understanding, and acceptance, and peace in the hearts of the protestors as well. And to the people who've rioted, give them understanding that there are better ways to go about their lives. Amen. 
All right, I'd like to start this hearing. The Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess of this subcommittee at any time. 
I welcome everyone to today's hearing on Protecting the Rights of Voters During the Covid-19 Pandemic. Thank all of our witnesses for joining us today. And I thank my colleagues for adapting to this new format and continuing to serve the American people during these challenging times. 
This is the first hearing of the Judiciary Committee conducted under the new House Remote Proceeding Rules. So, we might have a few spots, but we'll get through them. 
I would like to remind members that we have established an email address and distribution list dedicated to circulating exhibits, motions, or other written materials that members want to offer as part of our hearing today. If you would like to submit materials, please submit them to JudiciaryDocs--JudiciaryDocs--JudiciaryDocs@mail.House.gov And we will distribute them to members and staff as quickly as we can. 
It is also my understanding that the gentleman from Georgia--Mr. Collins--our former full committee ranking member will be joining our subcommittee for the remainder of this Congress since the full committee has not yet been able to meet to formally ratify the subcommittee assignments that he will be assuming without objection. Mr. Collins will be designated as a voting member of this subcommittee for the purpose of today's hearing. Welcome back, Mr. Collins. 
I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. We're in the midst of one of those moments in our nation's history where confronting a confluence of crises. The way we respond to them will shape fundamentally who we are as a people. 
To begin with, we meet virtually today because we're in the middle of a global pandemic that has taken the lives of over 100,000 of our fellow citizens, a pandemic that has exacerbated preexisting inequalities, disproportionately impacting African Americans among other historically disadvantaged people. 
This disproportionate impact in turn reflects America's original sin. A sin that is recognized--yes, it's recognized--in our revered founding document, The United States Constitution at the set of (PH) slavery. 
The systemic and pervasive (SP)--pervasive anti-black, white supremist ideology that under guarded (PH) it and continued on through Jim Crow laws in a resistance to change even to today resulting in unequal opportunities and other consequences which we're still grappling with. 
Another tragic manifestation of this racist poison is the pattern of practice of daily police violence against African Americans and the justifiable rage that many Americans of all races feel in reaction. And we've seen that on the streets all over America with peaceful protestors. 
In the past week, thousands have taken to the streets across the country to call to an end of police violence and to affirm that black lives matter. I stand in solidarity with all peaceful protestors. I'll do everything as my power as Chairman to build a better, more just America--a goal which I've dedicated my entire public life to starting back in 1977. 
It is in that vein that I'm holding this hearing today. The issue that we're here to discuss--protecting the right to vote during the Covid-19 pandemic--is intrinsically tied to the protests occurring across this nation. 
Police violence against black Americans and suppressing the right to vote are two sides of the same coin. The coin of systemic racism has plagued our country since before its founding in 1619 when African Americans were first brought to this country as slaves. 
Think about it. In 1619, that was 250 years before we became a nation we had slavery. From Jim Crow to the present, politicians--particularly in my home region, the south, but elsewhere as well--have sought to deny the ability of black Americans and other people of color to vote. 
People with disabilities, language minority voters, and Native Americans among others also had the right to vote undermined throughout our country's history denying them a say in how our nation is governed. 
Now we are dealing with a viral pandemic that is threatening the ability of most people to vote safely in our elections, but will have a disproportionate impact on voters of colors among others. States are being faced with a choice. Will they adapt to this new reality and ensure that everyone can vote safely in November or will they fail to act in the face of this historic challenge? 
We know what needs to be done. We must ensure that all Americans eligible to vote can cast their ballots by mail if they choose. And they shouldn't have to go through endless bureaucratic hurdles to do it. 
President Trump has said there's inherent fraud. That's been dismissed by about every academic--academician who has studied this in past elections in Utah, Oregon, Washington, even yesterday in Pennsylvania. 
But he also said when he made that tweet recently that he thought it'd be the end of the Republican Party which shows that he's not thinking about fraud, but he's thinking about politics. The fact is many republicans support mail-in voting, and have benefitted from it, and been elected. Florida's one case in particular. 
States must proactively send out ballots to voters or at least send out applications for mail-in ballots to make it easy for people who fear getting, you know, and if--especially if there's a spike in November, and even worse conditions, and even more reasons to be concerned. 
We must also ensure that voters can safely cast their votes in person, For many Americans such as people who have changed addresses recently or with certain disabilities, voting by mail is not a realistic option. And the most obvious way to ensure the polling places will not have large crowds and long lines is to spread out the voting period and allow people to cast their bat--ballots early. 
The HEROES Act which passed the House and is now sitting before the Senate would mandate each of those things. And critically, it would give the states funding they desperately need to carry all those out. 
If we can afford to give the Treasury Department $500 billion to bailout corporations, we can certainly afford the $3.6 billion it will cost to safeguard our democracy--the very basis of our shared station's unique system of government with its source of power--the people. 
No American should have to choose between their health, possibly their life and their sacred right to vote. Democracy--including the right to vote that underpins it--is the way our founders intended first to respond to whatever challenges we should face. It has been and must continue to be a defining characteristic of who we are as a nation. 
I look forward to hearing from each of our witnesses gathered here, thank them for agreeing to appear, and testify on this critical and timely subject. 
And at this point, it's my pleasure to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Johnson, for his opening statement. 
JOHNSON: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks to everybody. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks to everyone for--for joining us this morning. 
This is an important subject and I really appreciate the tone, Mr. Chairman, that you started with in the prayer. Everybody needs that right now. 
Before we discuss the--the specific topic of today's hearing, I too want to just mention two things that I think are appropriate for us as the Constitution subcommittee and the House. 
First--as you noted--this is the first public hearing we've had since the terrible event that occurred in Minneapolis last week. And there are some things that I think anybody objectively observing these events can see and should agree on. 
I mean, the--the--the facts show that Mr. George Floyd appears to have been the victim of--of murder. And I personally don't believe that a close review of the video can lead anyone to any other conclusion. 
And the tragedies focused to spotlight once again--as you said--on the deep-seated problems we still have in this country. I think all of us agree the crisis necessitates authentic reconciliation and transformative solutions for a systematic change. And I think we all agree that those are long, long overdue. 
The central idea of America is that we boldly declare the self-evident truths that all men are created equal. And for that reason, we're all endowed the founders said by God Himself with the same inane--inhalable rights because each of us is made in God's image. The founders insisted--and we still believe--that every single person has an estimable dignity and value. And our value's not related in any way to the color of our skin, or what zip code we live in, or what we can contribute to society. Our value is inherent because it comes from above. 
Any fool who contends that he has some sort of natural right of supremacy over his neighbors violates not only the foundational creed of America that's--that's articulated in the Declaration, but he also violates the greatest commandments of his creator. And I think that's important for us to acknowledge. 
My prayer is the same as yours, Mr. Chairman, that--that God will heal our nation and help us to see one another as He does. And we also pray that He protects the brave, honorable men and women who risk their lives every day on the front lines to serve in law enforcement because they too are in jeopardy right now. 
Looting and more violence in our nation's streets does nothing to solve any of these problems. It makes it worse and it needs to stop. And I'm sure we all--I know we all agree on that as well. 
The second point I wanted to make was that all of us recognize that the Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically affected our country. Obviously, in so many countless ways. We--we want to express our condolences to the families and friends of all those Americans who lost their battle to this invisible enemy. 
And we want to applaud the doctors, nurses, first responders, state and local health officials, and--and the Trump administration too for taking crucial steps that have helped to stem the spread of the disease any further. I--I--I'm grateful that President Trump instituted an early travel ban from China de--despite China's efforts to deceive the rest of the world about the effect of the virus. 
And I'm grateful the President instituted social distancing guidelines, and sanitation protocols, and created a taskforce led by our Vice President, Mr. Pence, and several leading medical experts with decades of experience in public health. That's been very important for the country in our response. 
While we're all adjusting to the new normal of our nation, I and the other republican members of this committee are also--we have to say this morning--disappointed that our committee's not literally (PH) meeting in D.C. right now to conduct this important hearing, you know. If we believe this--if grocery store workers, and healthcare personnel, and other essential employees can show up in person to do their job, we--we believe we ought to be doing the same thing. 
But on the issue of--of the--of the hearing today, I just want to say this and--and I'll be brief. We all believe in the importance of our elections that--that that's central to our republic and our democratic form of government. And we--we want every eligible American to participate in every vote. We just don't believe the suggestions proposed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in regards to our upcoming elections are in the best interests of maintaining the integrity of our election system. 
Unfortunately, much of what's been proposed amounts to vast and broad federal mandates for how states should run their elections. But we believe the mandate for the federal government's quite' clear. It's in the Constitution itself. 
The elections clause gives states the authority to administer elections within their jurisdiction. Congress does have the authority to override state laws to regulate federal elections. But much like everything else in the government, states know best how to serve their citizens. They are in the best position to determine how to run their elections based on each state's individual needs. 
If enacted, we're concerned that the changes proposed by the Majority will result in our nation conducting elections only by mail and not harvesting being legalized nationwide. Those--those provisions will decrease public confidence in the election process at the worst possible time and increase the election's susceptibility to fraud. 
Even the New York Times has acknowledged ""that there is a bipartisan consensus that voting by mail--whatever its impact--is more easily abused than other forms."" Similarly, the Bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform was co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III stated in its final report in 2005 that ""absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud in American elections."" 
In addition to the possibility of voter fraud, absentee voting also presents several practical problems when compared to in-person voting on election day or early voting at an official early voting location. We--we need to seriously discuss the implications that these practices will have on our elections. And putting aside the technical--technological and logistical concerns about federalizing the election this close to November, we need to also seriously examine the Accuracy of State Voter Registration rule. 
There are several examples of states whose voter registration rules outnumber the actual number of citizens in that state. Registered individuals should only be receiving one ballot. I know we all agree with that. And we need to ensure the United States Postal Service can deliver ballots on time and to the right people. 
While I acknowledge concerns about the pandemic and the election, now is not the time to upend this nation's election system. There's too much at risk. We should be discussing how to vote in-person and to do it safely in light of the new circumstances. 
We need to thoughtfully consider how the federal government can best empower states to make their own decisions regarding the election and to respond to their unique circumstances. 
I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses today. I hope we can have a productive discussion. 
I thank you, again, Mr. Chairman, for the tone and the opening. And I yield back. 
COHEN: You're very welcome. Mr. Johnson, and thank you for your statement. I would now like to recognize the Chairman of the Full Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Empire State New York, Mr. Nadler for his opening statement. 
NADLER: Thank you, Chairman Cohen, and thanks to all of our witnesses for joining us today. I want to note that although this is our first remote hearing, the committee has been hard at work since the outbreak of the pandemic. 
For example, we have held briefings and virtual roundtables to discuss issues such as price gouging during the Covid-19 crisis and the ways in which Immigration authorities in prisons and jails are responding to the pandemic. 
These events all informed our efforts to include measures in the CARES Act and HEROES Act in response to what we learned such as more than $600 million to address the Covid-19 crisis in state and local prisons and jails, and minimum standards for individuals in ICE detention, as well as provisions to encourage release of individuals who do not pose a risk to public safety. 
Other vital measures that we work hard to include in the HEROES Act are bankruptcy protection for homeowners, and significant funding for such critical programs as the Violence Against Women Act and the Legal Services Corporation. 
We have also passed legislation to ensure that public safety officers who die or become disabled as a result of Covid-19 will receive the benefits that they and their families deserve. And next week--as I announced over the weekend--we will hold a hearing to address issues related to police accountability. 
Even when we are spread throughout the country, this committee is hard at work and I appreciate all the members for their efforts during these challenging times. I would also like to acknowledge this profoundly painful moment for our nation. 
The wounds inflicted by centuries of racism and violence against black Americans have once again been torn open. And in response, thousands of Americans of all races have peacefully taken to the streets to exercise their constitutional rights and to demand change that is long overdue. 
We have a proud history of protests and demonstrations in this country that have led to much needed changes in public policy. With the most--but at the most basic level, we govern ourselves at the ballot box. 
Our leaders--from local sheriff's and prosecutors to members of Congress and the President--are supposed to be chosen by popular will. That is what makes this country a democracy. It is at the very core of self-governance by the people. 
But our democracy will face a profound test this November. In the face of this global pandemic, we can no longer tolerate business as usual in our polling places. In fact, business as usual was already intolerable. The hours long lines, purges of (PH) voter rules and red tape designed to suppress Americans' right to vote all strike at the heart of our system of self-government. 
Now these hurdles today might even be deadly. And the reason to fight the non-avoidable question of whether we will be able to call our democracy--ourselves a democracy at all. If this sounds alarmist, consider this. 
What is a system of government that deliberately whittles--whittles out voters because of their race, or their income, or their disability, or because of where they live? What is a system of government in which politicians play games to keep away eligible voters who might threaten their hold on power? 
It's not a democracy. It is something else. 
And what is a government that makes its citizens choose between exercising the most fundamental constitutional right--the right to vote--and their most basic human right to health and safety? 
So, I would like to say directly to the American people there is no sitting this out. Your elected representatives are either for our democracy or against it. We do not deserve that title if we deny you the right to cast your ballots this November or if we force you to choose between exercising that right and protecting your own health. 
That is why I support mandating that all states provide voters with the option to vote by mail this November. And I support providing the necessary federal resources to ensure that this happens smoothly. 
We must also preserve in-person voting options for those who choose not to vote by mail on--or are unable to do so, so that no one is disenfranchised. We can rise to meet today's unprecedented challenges and carry out free and fair elections in November despite the pandemic. 
As Chairman Cohen said, we know what needs to be done. But it will not happen without our focus and vigilance. Today's hearing is the first step in that process. 
I thank Chairman Cohen for holding this hearing. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and I yield back the balance of my time. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Nadler. At this point, we would normally go to the ranking member. But I understand that Mr. Jordan is not present and/or does not have a--a statement. So, we will go straight to our witnesses. 
We welcome our witnesses and thank them for participating in this important hearing. I'll now introduce each of the witnesses. And after each introduction, we'll recognize that witness for his/her--or her first statement. 
The written statements will be entered into the record in their entirety. Accordingly, I ask you to summarize your oral testimony at no more than five minutes. If you could take less time, that'd be great because of time constraints. I would strongly encourage you to limit those remarks perhaps to three if possible, so that members will have the maximum amount of time to ask questions. 
Absence of a timing light, I will note orally when five minutes have elapsed and bang my gavel. There will be--also be a timer on your screen, so please be mindful of it. I will be strict in the five minute rule. 
Before proceeding with testimony, I'd like to remind all of our witnesses that you have the legal obligation to provide a truthful statement and answers to this subcommittee, and that any false statements that you make today will subject you to present--to prosecution under Section 1001 of Title IXX The United States Code Annotated (PH). 
Our first witness is Jocelyn Benson, the 43rd Secretary of State of the state of Michigan. Her responsibilities include--include insuring elections are secure and accessible to the eligible Michigan voters. 
In addition to being an elected official, Secretary Benson is the author of State Secretaries of State: Guardians of the Democratic Process, the first major boon on the role of Secretary of State in enforcing elections and campaign finance law. 
Secretary of State Benson received her J.D. from Harvard Law School and previously served as Dean of Wayne State University School of Law in Detroit, Michigan which I visited with Chairman Conyers in past years. 
She is an expert on civil rights and election law. Madame Secretary, you're recognized for five minutes. 
BENSON: Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I started my career in Montgomery, Alabama investigating hate groups and hate crimes throughout the country. And it was there where I developed and solidified my own commitment to continue the work of those who sacrificed so much to ensure that every citizen's right to vote is protected and secure. 
And today, as Michigan Secretary of State and our state's Chief Election Officer, my work is informed and inspired by the work of many colleagues and advocates around the country, many of whom I'm honored to speak alongside today. 
As a whole, Secretaries of State are working across party lines to ensure our elections are accessible and secure in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and other challenges relating to the 2020 elections. 
But we need your help. Democracy is a team sport. And we need a sustained and committed partner in our federal government to ensure voters have the needed certainty and clarity that our elections will be held on schedule and that the right to vote will be secure. 
The $11.2 million that Michigan received with the CARES funding was welcome, but it was not enough to fill the $40 million gap that these new challenges create for our state. Importantly, the HEROES Act will address these concerns effectively and I urge everyone's support. 
For example, in 46 states and the District of Columbia, voters this year will have a right to vote by mail. But as we saw just yesterday, that right is implemented with varying degrees of effectiveness, Federal funding and standards the specifics of which are detailed in my written testimony will go a long way towards helping avoid these variations this fall. 
Voters need clear choices on how to vote this year, and states need clear guidance, and support in providing those choices. This need is particularly acute in cities in Michigan like Flint, and Detroit, and strongly disenfranchised communities throughout our country where voters confidence and trust in their government is an additional challenge to overcome. 
I want to close by sharing a success story from Michigan. We've held two elections this year--one just prior to the pandemic hitting our state and one in the midst of it. 
In early May, we hold--we held local elections in the height of the pandemic and demonstrated that even in the midst of this moment, safe and secure elections are possible. To succeed in this election, we mailed every registered voter in a jurisdiction with an election an application and instructions on how to request their ballot through the mail and vote from home. 
We also provided a safe option for voters seeking to cast their ballots in-person on election day. We aggressively recruited new election workers to ensure that no one had to work an election if they felt comfortable doing so. And we provided every jurisdiction with PPE masks, gloves, etc. along with clear and explicit protocols on how to insure six feet of distance between all election workers and voters. 
This gave voters options and enabled them to choose how to safely exercise their vote. The result was that turnout was double what it normally is for a May local election. And 99 percent of voters who participated in the May election chose to vote from home. 
There were no crowds in polling places. There were no long lines and there were zero reports of fraud. 
This success demonstrated that it is indeed possible with proper planning, policies, education and resources to ensure our elections this fall are safe, accurate, and secure. They also informed my more recent decision to again, mail every registered Michigan voter an application and instructions on how they can vote by mail ahead of our August primary and our November general elections. 
Democracy can and will survive this pandemic. But we need your ongoing help. We need all of us working together across party lines in investment and support to ensure that it does. Thank you. 
COHEN: Thank you, Secretary Benson, and thank you for condensing your remarks in interest of time. We'll have questions for you. 
Our next witness is Ms. Stacey Abrams. Ms. Abrams is Founder and Chair of Fair Fight Action--an organization dedicated to advancing voting rights and electoral reform. 
In 2018, she was the democratic nominee for Governor of the state of Georgia. First African American woman in U.S. History nominated by a major party as its nominee for Governor. Prior to running for governor, she served in the Georgia General Assembly from 2007 until 2017 serving as a House Minority Leader from 2010 to 2017. 
She became the first woman to lead a party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African American leader of a party in the State House of Representatives. Ms. Abrams received her JD from Yale Law School, her Master of Public Affairs from the LBJ School of Public Affairs at University of Texas in Austin, and her BA magna cum laude from Spelman (PH) College. 
I note that Ms. Abrams has another commitment at noon eastern. So, we must endeavor to stick to our time limit, so that every member who wants will have a chance to ask her a question. 
Ms. Abrams, welcome and you're recognized for five minutes. 
ABRAMS: Sorry. Thank you, Chairman Cohen, Vice Chairman Raskin, ranking member Johnson and members of the committee. 
I come before you today as a voting rights advocate, as the Founder of Fair Fight Action, and as an American deeply concerned about the challenges facing our democracy particularly in the era of Covid-19. 
Furthermore, I would do a disservice to millions of Americans if I too did not acknowledge the anger and aguish that link together our demands for justice and the right to choose our leaders. And through them, the policies that govern us through the profound power of the right to vote. 
Across our nation, we face a public health crisis, an economic disaster, continued distrust in our justice system and a coordinated assault on access to our democracy. Congressional action has been vital to respond to the pandemic, but access to the right to vote will determine how recovery and systemic justice are achieved. 
Financially exhausted states are reliant upon the compact made with the federal government for mutual aid in times of catastrophic--catastrophic events. To support and expand vote by mail, to place critical guardrails on access, to educate voters on their options, and to increase the safety of in-person voting, our obligation is to fund these changes. 
I appreciate what the House has done to acknowledge its fundamental obligation. And I urge your Senate colleagues to take immediate action to pass the HEROES Act. 
I was born in Madison, Wisconsin. And on April 7th, I watched in horror as the cautionary tale of their election took place. None of us should forget the image of voters shivering in long lines and crowded into the vastly reduced number of in-person polling locations. 
It was constant state journal report 71 known cases of coronavirus as a result of that election. The challenge is clear and uncontroverted. Crowded polling places pose a risk for voters and for the brave poll workers who risk their lives to help our democracy function during this pandemic. 
Our first obligation is to reduce the number of voters who will cast their ballots in person on election day through national access to vote by mail. All states have the current capacity. 
However, we must remove unnecessary barriers to participation and scale infrastructure to allow widespread use of the safe tested and audible method of balloting. Furthermore, the American people want expanded access vote by mail by a 2-to-1 margin despite the false reports of potential fraud. 
Voter fraud of any kind is extremely rare. As the New York Times noted, after 20 years, Oregon has documented an infinitesimal .00001 percent incident rate of fraud. And when we look at the nation as a whole, in 2016, more than half of the states reported zero substantiated allegations of voter fraud. 
Another eight states reported one such allegation and the remaining states found a demonymous (PH) number of cases. None sufficient to alter the outcome of elections. 
Recent election results also show that voting by mail offers neither party a partisan advantage. This finding confirms the fundamental truth. Our elections should not be partisan. The selections we make will be cast along party lines, but the process of determining our leadership should not be. 
Leaders of both parties should want higher participation in our democracy regardless of who wins. America does best when we acknowledge our challenges and prepare for success. The solution to promote both public health and participation in our democracy is to expand access to vote by mail to establish uniformed guidelines for 2020, so that where we live in our country will not diminish our right to participate in November's elections. 
I thank you for the opportunity to take part in this important hearing and I urge you to continue to protect access to our democracy. 
COHEN: Thank you so much, Ms. Abrams. 
Our next witness is Mr. Jay Christian Adams. Mr. Adams is the President and General Counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. From 2005-2010 he worked in the voting section of the United States Department of Justice. 
During his time with the Justice Department, he served as General Counsel for the South Carolina Secretary of State. He received his Law degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law. 
Mr. Adams, you're recognized for five minutes. 
ADAMS: Thank you very much, Chairman Cohen, Chairman Adler, ranking member Johnson, members of the committee. Thank you for the invitation today. 
I'm the President of the General Counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a non-partisan charity devoted to promoting election integrity and best practices for election officials. We found numerous failures in election administration. And we know from federal data that voting by mail is the most vulnerable form of voting where hundreds of thousands of ballots have been rejected for defects and millions more end up missing or in landfills. 
United States is not ready for an emergency national vote by mail scenario in 2020 and will not be. Putting the election into the hands of the United States Postal Service would have numerous problems. 
First, vote by mail would disenfranchise voters. It would move the election from transparent places where observers from both parties can monitor the process to moving it behind closed doors where the vulnerable and powerless are influenced by third parties. 
I have attached to my testimony a court opinion from the southern district of Mississippi in the case of United States vs. Brown. The committee can see plainly how vote by mail can abuse the most vulnerable. 
If you peruse the opinion from pages 17-21, you will see what ballot harvesting fraud looks like from the inside. Notably, the victims were poor and powerless. 
The victims were visited in their homes by politically connected vote harvesters and the vote harvesters cast the ballots, not the voters. Elections should be in the open, in transparent places where the vulnerable can be protected from the powerful trying to cast the ballot for them. 
Vote by mail also has logistical problems. The entire system was designed for in-person voting. We saw those failures yesterday in elections across the country and here in D.C. where tens of thousands of people in D.C. didn't return their ballot because they didn't get them in the mail. 
State election officials and even the U.S. Justice Department have been besieged by phone calls and complaints in the last few weeks about mail ballots never arriving. We do not have the administrative infrastructure to ensure a clean, automatic mail election based on current lists. 
Finally, we found for example, in Pittsburgh that people are not only registered twice or three times. The one voter was actually registered at seven active simultaneous times. My written toast--testimony shows the seven separate public voter registration records for the same person. He was registered to vote seven times by an out of state third party group in the weeks before the 2016 election. Under an automatic vote by mail plan, that person would get seven ballots. 
Thank you very much for your time and attention on this important matter. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Adams. And thank you for taking just three minutes and saving us some time. I appreciate it very much. 
Our next witness is Ms. Myrna Perez. She's the Director of the Voting Rights and Election Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. That's in Chairman Nadler's district. 
She's the author of several nationally recognized reports and articles. She's a lecturer at Columbia Law School--also in Chairman Nadler's district--and has served as Adjunct Professor of Clinical Law at the NYU School of Law--still in Adler's district. 
She received her Law degree from Columbia University school, master of Public Policy from Harvard, Kennedy School of Government an undergraduate degree BA. 
Ms. Perez, you're recognized for five minutes. 
PEREZ: Thank you, members, for having me. In this time of reckoning for the country, I briefly map out five critical needs that each state must address to ensure that no voter is left behind during this pandemic. 
My written testimony provides more details and a voluminous resource appendix. But the single most important thing that members of this committee can do to protect our elections against Covid is to play your part in getting state and local election administrators additional financial resources. 
Funding aside, here are the needs. First, we must expand registration opportunities. The moment we are in now makes plain that our democracy works best when we are all heard. 
At this time in past presidential election years, we'd be seeing an increase in voter registration rates. Not seeing that now and this is no surprise. 
Government agencies that provide voter registration are closed. Community groups that ordinarily register voters are unable to do in-person outreach. 
Accordingly, the states that don't have online registration should provide it and the states that do should boost their capacity. All online registration systems should account for the fact that some Americans do not have DMV I.D.'s. Some Americans have disabilities and some prefer to conduct important business in another language. 
Also, the digital divide is real. So, all Americans must have lower tech registration options too. 
Second, all eligible Americans must have the option to vote by mail. Now every state in this country has absentee or mail voting for at least some of its citizens. That option should be available to every eligible American, so that no voter has to expose themselves or others to the coronavirus. 
Americans from all walks of life want to vote by mail. We know this because of polls and we know this because of the increase in amount of requests for mail ballots. 
Despite some incendiary and untrue rhetoric, vote by mail is a necessary, secure, and sensible option especially now with the November elections. Of come--of course, there may be some witnesses making a lot of hay out of the rare instances of abuse. 
There is zero dispute that appropriate safeguards should be in place and they are. In fact, there are multiple layers of security for each ballot. That's why the instances of fraud are so rare. 
Third, we must provide safe in-person voting options. I want to point out that no one thus far has been talking about only mail elections. 
Even if more voters will vote by mail this November, the country is still going to need an adequate number of polling places. Why? 
Lots of reasons. Polling places are needed fail safes because there are going to be inevitable glitches as we scale up to the massive increase in vote by mail. 
There are some Americans who are very deeply attached to in-person voting. Some voters need language assistance, or have physical, or visual impairments that make in-person voting a necessity. 
And finally, some voters have mail address issues or problems with unreliable mail service. States and localities should offer sufficient hours and days of early voting to reduce crowds and minimize lines. Polling places should be frequently cleansed and in venues suitable to comply with physical distancing. 
Poll workers and voters need PPE and disposable implements like pens to mark paper ballots or Q-tips to present (INAUDIBLE). 
Furthermore, we must educate voters about the election process. Voter education is more important now than ever because of changes to primary dates and mail voting rules, and because misinformation and disinformation are real threats that are occurring today. 
Finally, we must be prepared for new cyber security threats. Resources that should have been available to secure election technology now have to be diverted to making sure that elections actually happen this November. 
We must continue to audit and test all of our electronic systems particularly online registration and mail ballot application systems that will see greater use. Additionally, we need risk limiting and other post-election audits to ensure that we can trust our result tallies. 
Fortunately, in many places, officials of both parties are working on it. We need more of it. 
I'm going to end with where I started. The changes needed to leave no voter behind require resources. We estimate that it'll cost close to $4 billion. Ultimately, the smooth administration of the November election will depend in large part on the levels of support that elected officials like yourselves are providing to election administrators and voters during this crisis. 
I am hopeful that members of this committee will model the leadership and commitment our country desperately needs right now on these topics. Thank you. 
COHEN: Thank you, Ms. Perez. Our next witness is Tom Fitton. And if I'm wrong, please correct me when you start. He's President of Judicial Watch, a position he's held since 1998. Judicial Watch describes itself as a public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption seeking to ensure that government and judicial officials act ethically and do not abuse the powers entrusted them by the American public. 
Judicial Watch primarily seeks access to government records, files Freedom of Information Act and other public records, lawsuits, and engages in other forms of civil litigation. Mr. Fitton--Fiton (PH) has had over 20 years of public policy experience. He received his B.A. in English from George Washington University. 
You are recognized for five minutes, sir. 
FITTON: Thank you, Chairman Cohen. And like the other participants, we really appreciate your prayer at the beginning. 
Unfortunately, for years Americans have been losing faith in the integrity of our elections. Last year--Gallop has been tracking this for years. Last year, they asked if Americans had confidence in the integrity of elections and the honesty of elections specifically. 
Only 40 percent of Americans said yes, 59 percent said no. And frankly, this isn't helped by plans like Governor Newsom who issued a--by an executive order last--recently requiring the county election officials transmit mail ballots to every registered voter in the state. 
I view this as the real threat to the integrity of our elections. In 2005--back when there was a bipartisan understanding about the threat of voter fraud and its connection to voter fraud--to vote by mail and absentee ballots--the Carter Baker Commission noted that absentee balloting is vulnerable to abuse in several ways. 
Blank ballots mailed to the wrong address, to large residential buildings may--might get intercepted. Citizens who vote at home, at nursing homes, at the workplace, or in church are more susceptible to pressure over and subtle or to intimidation. 
Vote buying schemes are far more difficult to detect when citizens vote by mail. We're particularly concerned about ballots being mailed to the wrong address. Voter registration lists throughout the country are out of date containing registrations for voters who no longer live at the stated address, who have died, or otherwise are not eligible to vote. 
Acute (PH) Research Center from many years back found that there were 24 million where 1 out of every 8 active voter registrations in the United States that were no longer valid or significantly inaccurate. At least 1.8 million deceased individuals were listed as active voters at that time. 
I don't think things have gotten much better. Out of states provided to the Election Assistance Commission in 2019 showed hundreds of U.S. counties with voter lists containing more registered voters than were--than there were citizens over the age of 18 meaning that the registration rate was over 100 percent. 
And looking at that data, we concluded there were at least 2.5 million extra registrants on our nation's voter rolls. The extra registrations include both outdated and currently active registrations as well as inactive registrations that are pending removal. 
Note that even inactive registrations can still be voted upon on election day. This doesn't require a voter to use their provisional ballot. The voter just needs to show up and say or affirm his or her address typically. And in many states, that can be done just through an oral representation. 
To be clear, the poll worker asks the voter if he or she lives at the listed address. And the voter just says yes. At that point, the voter can vote. 
Many counties have lists containing outdated registrations as I said. Alleghany County, Pennsylvania--after we warned them about this--removed nearly 70,000 names from their list because people hadn't voted within the legally required two election cycles. 
If only--it only removed them after receiving a warning letter. North Carolina's only published data shows nearly a million inactive registrations. Pennsylvania admits to 800,000 inactive registrations. We've sued those states to try to clean those rolls up. 
Governor Newsom's executive order in California seems particularly cynical. While he's relied on emergency powers in the face of the pandemic to order all mail ballot elections, he notably has failed to restrict ballot harvesting under state law which means that people will be showing up and interacting with people as they gather ballots increasingly obviously, the likelihood of health issues. 
Public health is cited as a justification for mail ballots, but is absent when talking about the massive ballot harvesting schemes being foisted upon or the attempt to foist ballot harvesting schemes on Americans. 
Look, in the end, this crisis--this pandemic--has blown up our economy. It's suppressed our liberties. Let's not let it blow up our elections. 
COHEN: Thank you, sir. Appreciate you getting done in time too. 
Next, our witness is Mr. Dale Ho. Mr. Ho is the Director of the Union Voting Rights Project at the ACLU--the American Civil Liberties Union. In that role, he supervises the ACLU's voting rights, litigation and advocacy work nationwide. 
He currently has active cases in dozens of states throughout the country. He's testified on election law issues before the Congress and in various state legislatures. 
He's also Adjunct Clinical Professor at NYU School of Law. He received his JD from Yale, his undergraduate degree from Princeton. 
Mr. Ho, thank you. You're recognized for five minutes. 
HO: Chairman Nadler, Chairman Cohen, ranking member Johnson, and members of the subcommittee, the Covid-19 pandemic presents the greatest challenge to elections administration since the 1864 presidential election was conducted during the Civil War. We will likely have fewer poll workers and polling places than in 2016 and more voters assigned per voting location than ever all in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has already killed more than 100,000 Americans. 
If we truly believe that no American should have to choose between protecting their health and exercising their right to vote, we must follow the CDC's recommendation to allow all Americans to use voting methods that minimize direct contact with other people and reduce crowd size at polling locations. 
Now this is a big challenge. More than 80 million Americans voted in person on election day in 2016. We must help our fellow citizens and states shift to more early and absentee voting than ever. That is why the ACLU has actively advocated in more than 30 states and filed 10 lawsuits since the pandemic began including rulings in Virginia, Montana and South Carolina. 
This morning, my colleagues are arguing by videoconference at a hearing in Chairman Cohen's home state of Tennessee for the right to vote safely by mail during the pandemic. Protecting the health of our fellow Americans and of our democracy itself is not a partisan issue. 
Taking from the Republican National Committee, which recently sent a mailer in Pennsylvania proclaiming that ""voting by mail is an easy and secure way to cast your ballot"". It is the height of bad faith that a president who himself votes by mail and the Attorney General would in recent remarks seek to undermine the American public's confidence in no excuse absentee voting which the majority of states currently offer--33 in all including several represented on this subcommittee such as North Dakota, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
And of the 17 states that normally don't, 12 have relaxed their requirement to allow voters to vote absentee during their primaries including Indiana, New Hampshire and West Virginia. Following ACLU lawsuits, South Carolina did the same and Missouri passed a bill that if signed will also do so. 
These 12 states are a broad coalition of so-called red, blue and purple states. And they've shown that it's not too late. States can adjust now to protect every American's right to vote safely during the pandemic. They must maintain that commitment in November. 
The remaining only five states currently refusing to let all voters vote absentee--Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Missouri. Voters in these states--including the constituents of many members of this committee--must have the same right to vote safely during the pandemic that everyone else in this country has. 
The ACLU therefore supports the Vote Safe Act H.R. 6807 introduced by Congressman Clyburn and Senator Harris. Among other things, it authorizes $5 billion for elections administration including health and safety at polling places and requires states to permit no excuse absentee and early voting (INAUDIBLE). 
States are already seeing unprecedented levels of absentee requests. For example, Pennsylvania had an 18-fold increase in such requests compared to 2016. 
States need federal support for printing and processing more mail-in ballots than in any previous election. Congress has rightfully authorized trillions of dollars in spending to respond to the Covid-19 crisis. 
In this context, five billion is a rounding error. We include--we urge the--the--the inclusion of the Vote Safe Act in any additional Covid legislation this year. 
And as ranking member Johnson noted, we must insure that the Postal Service can do its job. That means insuring it has full funding to remain solvent. It's a small, but critical price to safeguard our democracy. 
Thank you. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Ho. Barbara Arnwine is our next witness. She's President and Founder of the Transformative Justice Coalition. She has previously worked on matters including the passage of the Landmark Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the 2006 reauthorization of Provision of Voting Rights Act. 
Currently, she also serves as Co-Chair and Facilitator of the National Commission for Voter Justice, the millennial (PH) votes, matters, convenings and the Voting Rights Alliance. She's the Head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law from February 1989 until June of 2015. And she holds an honorific title of President of (INAUDIBLE). 
She's taught at Columbia University School of Law. Ms. Arnwine holds degrees from Duke School of Law and Scripps College. Ms. Arnwine, you're recognized for five minutes. Thank you. 
ARNWINE: Yes, thank you so much, Chairman Cohen, and ranking member Johnson, and all the members of the subcommittee. I just want to talk and add a supplement which you've heard already. 
(INAUDIBLE) voter suppression is already a reality. I have been writing about voter suppression--61 forms of voter suppression--You can find it at VotingRightsAlliance.org--playing out what has been confronting our country since 2011 in this modern era. 
But now because of Covid-19, we're seeing an era of virus voter suppression. In Texas, we had 16.2 million voters totally confused about can they in fact vote if they are afraid of Covid or if--like in the state of Missouri--they are in a hospice, or if they are in a nursing home, or if they have comorbidities. And the courts have been unclear. 
Ken Paxton--the Texas AG--has been threatening to in fact, raise several criminal (INAUDIBLE) against voting rights' groups. (INAUDIBLE) 
We also know that another thing that we have not talked about yet is that in the National Press, there have been articles reporting on threats by bad actors to actually place 50,000 (INAUDIBLE) teams of so-called voter challengers at the polls talking about they're going to recruit and facilitate participation of voter challengers who are former military, and former, and off-duty police officers. And we know that the targets of these polls--of these actions--as we've seen in the past at our polls are voters of color. I've had to stop such programs in Louisville, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and other places. 
I also wanted to point out that--as Myrna Perez pointed out--that we need to really invest right now in massive voter registration campaigns including drive-up voter registration which has been used now by some people and it's having some racist sets (PH). We need to institute massive voter outreach and voter educations. 
And we did not talk about one of the big problems that we had in 2016 that led to some of the decrease in African American voter participation and that is the problem of disinformation and foreign interference. And we know that that is still a problem and the big techs have not done enough to address that problem especially Facebook. 
So, we need to create massive rapid response systems to combat voter disinformation. We also--another thing that hasn't been mentioned--is that of the eight--of the 214 million plus registered voters, some 8.7 percent are on what's called an active list. 
If you're on an active list in many of these states, you do not receive a mail-in ballot. You will not receive an application. You've got to go through a process to clean up whatever the issue is. And we believe there should be aggressive outreach to the 18 million people in our country who sit on an active list. 
We also believe that there are eight--as we know, there are over 18 million people who've been purged in the last several years who have no clue that they've been purged from the voter rolls. They also deserve active outreach. 
These are the important things in the voter options. Of course, vote by mail's only one option. And it's--and it really should be viewed as only one option because vote by mail has several impediments for people of color communities. 
And I'm not going to get into those. Those are laid out, you know, in my testimony about what we could do to make sure that those are not barriers. 
But we also got to have in addition to expand early voting, we need drive-up voting. We have found out one thing nobody talks about is that in the space that I have modeled--vote by mail--they have (INAUDIBLE). 
COHEN: You're coming up to five minutes. 
ARNWINE: Yes, sir. 
COHEN: Wrap up. 
ARNWINE: And I am--and that actually concludes my testimony. Thank you so much, Mr. Cohen. 
COHEN: You're welcome, Ms. Arnwine. Thank you for appearing before our committee and for your work. 
Our final witness is Michelle Bishop. Ms. Bishop is the Disability Advocacy Specialist for Voting Rights at the National Disability Rights Network where she responds both for coordinating voting rights initiatives in every U.S. state, district and territory, as well as providing training and technical assistance to you--the nationwide network regarding voting rights and access for voters with disabilities under the Help America Vote Act. 
Ms. Bishop received her master's of Social Work in Social Economic Development from Brown School of Washington U in St. Louis and a master of Arts in Sociology and English Literature from State University of New York at Geneseo. 
Ms. Bishop, you're now recognized for five minutes. 
BISHOP: Thank you for the opportunity to testify today representing the National Disability Rights Network--or NDRN--which is a non-profit membership organization for the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy or PNA network. 
Social distancing is our best line of defense from the threat of Covid-19. And naturally, vote by mail is a critical piece of the puzzle for keeping elections safe during the pandemic. It behooves elections administrators to allow for as many voters as possible to choose voting from home for their own safety, as well as the health of their fellow voters and elections personnel. 
Reducing in-person turnout in 2020 is unfortunately necessary to enable in-person voters to properly social distance while voting and allow poll workers to sanitize between voters. Therefore, now is the time to relax deadlines for request and return of mail ballots. 
Now is the time to eliminate barriers like requirements for doctor notes, notaries and witness signatures. These extra hoops to jump through pose a health risk for voters with disabilities and particularly those that are immunosuppressed who are under stay-at-home orders or in quarantine. They must then break their self-isolation to access doctors, notaries or witnesses simply to be able to vote. 
Even with these measures in place, it should be voted that traditional vote by mail systems are not and have never been accessible to voters with disabilities. People who are blind or low vision have print disabilities, limited literacy, limited manual dexterity and other disabilities cannot privately and independently mark, verify and cast a hand marked paper ballot. 
States that have not already done so must immediately implement some form of electronic ballot delivery or remote accessible ballot marking system that provides an electronic ballot to voters who choose to vote from home. These technologies are widely available and have been in use reliably for years in primarily vote by mail states, and for military, and overseas voters. 
When vote by mail systems are not made accessible for voters with disabilities, we in essence ask people with disabilities--who are considered the most vulnerable under Covid-19--to be the only voters who take to the polls and assume the personal health risk of in-person voting while their non-disabled peers have the privilege of voting from the safety of their homes. 
That said, voting by mail is not and may never be a panacea (PH). Many of the remote accessible vote by mail systems currently market ready or in use by voting jurisdictions across the nation make vote by mail significantly more accessible, but not fully accessible. 
As a result, in-person voting locations must be available to the greatest extent possible and follow Center for Disease Control and other federally recommended health guidelines for Covid-19 safety. Early voting periods and hours for in-person voting must be extended for several weeks before election day to reduce congestion at the polls and allow for social distancing. 
The number of ballot marking devices or other accessible voting stations must also be significantly increased at every polling location and voters should be allowed to vote curbside. Even in states where curbside voting is not currently allowed, its use with ease accessibility and federal compliance issues that will inevitably arise from the limited number of available polling places and unexpected relocation of polling places, as well as to allow voters at greater risk in regard to COVID-19 to limit their exposure. 
Many members of Congress have stepped up to propose legislation to help address these issues, including the HEROES Act and the vote SAFE Act. And DRN calls on Congress to work together to pass a bill that will address the safety issues raised around voting during this time, as well as ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities. Congress must also act now to pass the PAVA Program Inclusion Act and provide the territorial government and PNA of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as the Native American Disability Law Center with desperately needed PAVA funding to ensure access to the vote for Pacific Islanders and Native Americans with disabilities. Extending funding to the only two PNAs excluded from the protection and advocacy for Voter Access Program is a simple and no-cost legislative fix. 
Finally, Congress and the U.S. Department of Justice play a critical role in ensuring that elections are fair, accurate, safe, and accessible. The delicate patchwork of federal laws that protect the rights of voters with disabilities must be protected, restored, and enforced to their full capacity. We call them Americans with disabilities because they are first and foremost Americans and their civil rights, as well as the health of all voters and the health of our democracy, depend on it. Thank you. 
COHEN: Thank you, Ms. (INAUDIBLE). That concluded our witnesses and we'll go to the period questions. Each member will have five minutes to ask questions and I'll start with myself. 
For Ms. Abrams, thank you for joining us today. Out of all the challenges that you and other witnesses have described in carrying out the election this November, what worries you the most? is an intentional voter suppression or is it sheer incompetence or some combination of the two? Ms. Abrams? 
ABRAMS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let's understand that voter suppression takes three forms. Can you register and stay on the rolls? Can you access the ballot and can you get your ballot counted? As the number of the witnesses have testified, voter registration remains a challenge, as does voter purging based on false information and poor, to use your language, incompetence often that removes people from the rolls unnecessarily. 
But what we also have to focus on is the ability to cast a ballot, as Ms. Bishop pointed out. The challenge that we face is that there are populations that only have one method of casting their ballot because of disability, because of language barriers, because of homelessness or displacement due to evictions and foreclosures through COVID-19, or because they are unable to participate otherwise in the process voter--voting by mail, they need to go in person. And so my deep worry is that because we focus on one or the other to the exclusion of one of those processes, we do not use the full toolbox at our disposal, and we invalidate the opportunity to vote. 
I would like to point out to this committee that South Korea which began experiencing COVID-19 infection rates at the exact same time as the United States managed to scale up a national election on April 15 that had the single highest voter turnout they've seen in 30 years. They did it through a combination of investing in vote by mail but also meeting the guidelines for health protection when people went to vote in person. 
That is why the critical nature of the HEROES Act says that we don't pick one or the other but we absolutely fund the states, as Secretary of State Benson pointed out, we fund states to scale up their existing capacity. 34 states vote by mail already, 16 states have--34 states have vote by mail with no excuses, 16 require excuses. As Mr. Ho pointed out, there's only a handful of states right now that are refusing to expand that access because of restrictions on who can provide an excuse. But if we do all three, if we provide in-person voting early, in-person voting on election day, and vote by mail, then we will not have to face the question is of incompetence because any challenges to the voting process can be met by allowing people to utilize another methodology. 
COHEN: Thank you, Ms. Abrams. Secretary Benson, President Trump falsely accused you of illegally sending millions of mail-in ballots Michigan voters. Can you explain what Michigan actually did? And in your mind, is this a partisan issue? 
BENSON: Thank you for the question and the opportunity to again restate and clarify exactly what we did at Michigan. 
One, we feel that educating voters about their choices and rights in the midst of this pandemic is exactly the job of secretaries of State to election officers right now. What I did in Michigan, as several of my colleagues in West Virginia in Iowa and Nebraska and Georgia have also done, is simply mail an application to every registered voter for them to request to vote by mail and receive a ballot through the mail in August and in our August primary and in our November elections. Now, that's something that in particular and has been called for by the voters I serve and work for, in their--their effort to amend our constitution in 2018 to create a right to vote by mail for every citizen in our state. 
So in my view, this is not--not nearly an--a partisan issue and certainly shouldn't not be one. The responsibility and authority that secretaries of state have to educate and inform citizens about their rights, particularly in this time of great uncertainty and give them the clarity as to how they exercise that vote regardless of who they vote for. It's critical. 
And I also want to mention two things if I can because there's been a lot of misinformation also about what happens when you get an application and why this is so difficult than getting a ballot. An application simply enables the voter to both affirmatively request that they'd like to vote by mail and confirm their identity when they do so. It actually enables us to clarify and--and clean our lists in a way that ensures that we're accurately delivering a vote by mail to our citizens who are rightfully registered to vote and--and addressing issues as they may arise if there are voters who may have been recently deceased who are on our list that we then can learn about and--and take steps to remove. So the--the other piece of this is our effort in Michigan has actually enabled us to increase the integrity of the elections to increase the-- 
COHEN: --Let me ask you this. Did any Republicans complain about the--the results of the election and claim there was fraud in the--in the absentee votes? 
BENSON: No. Not in the May election. 
COHEN: Okay. Yes, yes. It was mentioned that the post office didn't get some ballots delivered on time in DC. If a person asked for an absentee ballot and didn't get it on time, can they not still 
go to the election booth if they can make it and ask to vote in person? 
BENSON: Yes, at least in Michigan, which I can say with authority. In Michigan, if you don't--one we can track when ballots have been received. And we're implementing a voter tracking system so that voters can track that receipt and return a balance as well so that they can plan ahead. But yes, if for whatever reason you haven't received or just have chosen not to return your ballot prior to the election, you will always have in Michigan the option to show up in person, surrender your ballot if you have it or simply note that-- 
COHEN: --Thank you-- 
BENSON: --it's voted and then vote in person. 
COHEN: Thank you. Mr. Ho, just--my time's running out. You mentioned that Tennessee is having an election, a jurisdiction, a court action. This--what--even if the suit is successful, what are some of the dangerous issues decided by the courts? 
HO: Thank you for that, Chairman Cohen. So I--I--you broke up for a minute there. So I wasn't quite sure what your question-- 
COHEN: --If--if-- 
HO: --was-- 
COHEN: --If the court--if the court right now in Tennessee, what are some of the successful (INAUDIBLE) successful of having these issues determined in court rather than by the legislature? 
HO: Well, I think it's best for these kinds of issues to be resolved in advance of the election, as far in advance of the election as possible to give elections authorities the time that they need to prepare. I think that's obviously the ideal way to do it. But where a legislature won't do that, such as the case in your home state of Tennessee, there's no choice. If we want all voters to have the option, the choice not to risk their health when they're exercising their right to vote, we have no choice but to go to court. And that hearing is underway right now as I speak and (INAUDIBLE) in Davidson County. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Ho, for your action. My time is up and I'd like to recognize Mr. Johnson for five minutes. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll get right to it. 
First question is for Mr. Fitton. In May, House Democrats passed the HEROES Act as it has been discussed and included various proposals aimed at federalizing the election process. One of those proposals, as we know is ballot harvesting. That's still a term that's unfamiliar to a lot of Americans who haven't experienced that. Could you briefly explain what ballot harvesting is and why it's so susceptible to fraud? 
FITTON: Well, ballot harvesting in the way critics have described it, such as Judicial Watch would allow third-party strangers to go around and collect ballots and then allegedly deliver them to polling places or locations for ballots are collected. And in California, they have an extreme version of ballot harvesting that has virtually no regulation about who can do it, whether they can select someone based on whether they're Democrats or Republicans. They don't have real checks in place to make sure that ballots are delivered. And obviously, when you have third-party strangers going around collecting ballots, that's a recipe for voter intimidation. 
It's one thing to allow in emergency circumstances a terribly, for instance, infirm person to have their spouse deliver a ballot for them. It's far--it's far different to have party operatives and interested third parties roaming the streets knocking on doors and demanding or, quote, ""asking"" for ballots. It's--it's a recipe for voter intimidation and that's why it is largely banned across the country. We rightly oppose what happened in North Carolina with that ballot-harvesting fraud but of course, bow harvesting was illegal in North Carolina. And you can see why because of the temptation for fraud. 
So this--this bill that's out there, as best I can tell, would nationalize this intimidatory ballot harvesting scheme, upend the voting laws in terms of voter ID in 35 states, and undermine the security to the extent it's available or has been implemented in the few states that pursuing it on--in--on absentee ballots. It's a--talk about causing chaos on Election Day to do this so--so close to Election Day is just irresponsible, in my view. 
JOHNSON: Thank you very much. 
Mr. Adams, Democrats have also proposed that states, when an election is held, quote, ""in an area in which an emergency or disaster,"" unquote, is declared will automatically (INAUDIBLE) to register voters in that area and your organization, the Public Interest Legal Foundation found that 244 counties spanning 29 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, had voter registration rates over 100 percent of the population. How might these bloated registration rolls lead to increased fraud if the states adopt all mail voting? 
ADAMS: Right, and we've--we've upped the game of just looking at that ratio where we've actually looked at the rolls and as you see in my written testimony, individuals like Rashan Slade (SP) and Pittsburgh are registered seven different times. We have duplicate registrations around the country. People get on the rolls in multiple states. If you had automatic vote mail--mail outs, Mr. Ranking Member, you would have people like Rashan Slade getting seven ballots to the vote in the Pennsylvania election. That's not good policy, no matter--no matter what the need. 
JOHNSON: Very good. Mr. Fitton, back to you. The election clause in the U.S. Constitution gives each state the authority to administer elections within its jurisdiction, and it only gives Congress the authority to step in to regulate federal elections, as we know. But arguably states are best positioned to administer elections to address their own unique needs. Do you agree with that sentiment? And if so, what challenges do you foresee if every state is forced to administer an election in the same manner? 
FITTON: Well, you--one-size-fits-all isn't going to work. You have the Baker-Carver Commission, and note the org example, as being the exception that proves the rule. Just because they work in Oregon doesn't mean it will work in other states. In states where you have populations that are--move in and out more quickly, you have tremendous risks to having all-mail voter fraud or increased risk for voter fraud as a result of having these mail ballots flood the system, both, frankly, with applications and ballots directly. 
You know, the concern is, are the states doing sensible steps to make sure that people are able to vote on Election Day? And, look, what we're hearing about today is the plan that's been in place long before COVID. So they're using, in my view, the pretext of the pandemic as an excuse to get a policy proposal that will undermine election integrity. Why oppose voter ID? Why oppose federal law that requires states to take reasonable steps to clean up the rolls? Why oppose even the notion of citizenship verification? To me that setting up the steel and the American people will have the right to have confidence in their elections. And when I hear about the rare instances of voter fraud, I get frustrated. If it's your vote that's stolen-- 
UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) 
FITTON: --it's not right that's destroyed. 
COHEN: Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Mr. Johnson. 
JOHNSON: Yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
COHEN: Thank you, sir. Our next witness--our next questioner is Mr. Nadler from New York for five minutes. 
NADLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Secretary Benson, we've--we're hearing a lot today about voter fraud. Could you briefly describe what Michigan does to ensure that mail-in ballots are legitimate? Ways that states can do this without suppressing the right to vote, and particularly comment on what Mr. Fitton said about ballot harvesting? 
BENSON: Sure, I'll start with the ballot harvesting. Of course, it is illegal and the term ballot harvesting does not appear in Michigan law. But--you know, the question is about whether a person can drop off another person's ballot There are really only limited circumstances in which that is allowed and generally only by an immediate family member or someone that the voter shares a home with. But importantly, the signature check has on multiple levels are confirmation that the only person voting a ballot, returning a ballot is the voter themselves. That signature takes place, the signature check takes place both when the application is returned and the voter requests a ballot to be sent to them that signature on that application is matched with their voter registration signature. 
And then secondly, when the ballot is ultimately returned, the voter must sign the outside of the envelope and that signature is then matched to all the other signatures we have on file. And as any expert will tell you it is--it is significantly harder to forge a signature than it is even to create a fake ID. And so in our view, in my view, that signature check enables us and this is a time tested method that has been in place in states for decades to ensure that--that the people returning ballots, voting a ballot are the voters themselves. And two, if there is any effort to create any--any fraud in the process that we catch it and that we prosecuted swiftly and effectively. 
NADLER: And more generally, how frequently have you seen incidents of election fraud in your state, whether from mail-in ballots or in-person voting? 
BENSON: Evidence of fraud is infinitesimal in Michigan and in many other states. Some that have been doing vote by mail for decades and others around the country. So and again, it's infinitesimal. Several studies have consistently shown and--and secondly, in the rare times when it does occur, we catch it and we prosecute it. 
NADLER: Thank you. 
Secretary Benson, Attorney General Barr recently said that he was worried about foreign governments sending fake mail-in ballots to manipulate our elections. Several state election officials have said this concern is baseless, including because states closely track ballots when they mail them out in the first place. Does it seem plausible to you that a foreign government could mail in counterfeit ballots in Michigan? 
BENSON: No, it does not. And to me that more strikes to what is a bigger issue facing our elections and our electorate this year, which is the effort to sow seeds of doubt in the integrity of the process and in that way harm voters' confidence in the elections and in their results. That effort to push back against misinformation, false information about our elections process is one of the most important efforts that we all need to be engaged in across party lines this year. 
NADLER: Thank you. Ms. Abrams, in this moment of profound pain across our nation, I'm especially troubled that the American people may be losing faith in our institutions of government and then our democracy itself. What would you say to potential voters who are worried that their ballots won't be counted or--or who have lost faith that their participation matters? 
ABRAMS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I think the most effective statement we can make is that we want every eligible voter to be able to cast their ballot and protect their health. One of the challenges facing our nation is a deep suspicion about the value of every voice and the value of every person in our nation. And to the extent that we know a disproportionate number of those dispossessed in our process are people of color, namely African Americans. It is a critical moment for us to demonstrate that their access to the ballot will not be impeded because of situations beyond their control. 
We watched people get sick in Wisconsin standing in long lines, forced to crowd together because of diminished polling places in order to cast a ballot for their future. And we know that the 2020 election is going to necessarily draw a great deal of attention because we're not only running a presidential election, we are running elections that are going to determine everything from district attorneys, county sheriffs, to state legislators and governors. And so we want every American who has the right to vote, to know that they have the freedom to do so. 
And the access and that access will not exist if we have limited means, and people have to put their lives at mortal risk in order to cast a ballot. That simply reaffirms the belief that we do not value their humanity and that is an inappropriate statement for any animal Americans make especially political leaders who are charged with ensuring access to our democracy. 
NADLER: And that's why mail-in voting is so crucial. 
ABRAMS: Absolutely. Mail-in voting is part of the process. But again, they're going to be populations that cannot use mail-in voting. So let's be clear, we don't want--I do not advocate for universal mail-in validating. I advocate for mail-in balloting in the 2020 election in response to the COVID pandemic that allows every eligible American the option to mail in their ballot rather than put their life at risk by standing in a crowded line and likely reduced places unless they absolutely have to because they have no other option. 
NADLER: Thank you and I yield back. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it. Our next questioner will be Mr. Gohmert of Texas. Five minutes. 
GOHMERT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I too, appreciate the way you started this hearing. Been used to Christian beliefs being belittled by majority too many times since your arrival in 2007. So I am really honest in saying how much I appreciate the tenor with which you started this hearing. I also want to express thoughts and prayers going for George Foley--I'm sorry, George Floyd family, and all of those--just tragic the looting and rioting we've seen, especially costing minority businesses their life's work. 
Real tragedy and we need to bring about this same type of feeling that we've had in this hearing. We can disagree but not get violent, not destroy people or for goodness sakes, the Italia Marie Kelly was killed by a protester and her sister, Lee. You know, it wasn't a cop. It was one of you, people, protesters, that kind of stuff. We all need to encourage that kind of thing to stop. 
And I keep hearing in this hearing though about the concern over the COVID-19 or coronavirus but I haven't heard any of our witnesses, for the majority, express that concern about the protests, the rioting, and looting. Whereas in many places, we're not even allowed to go unless we wear a mask but that's those of us who are trying to be law-abiding. 
Mr. Fitton, do you call the aftermath of the election in 2000. And, well, 2000--2001? Who it was that was screaming for election reform and that every single county, every parish, everybody needed to go to electronic voting and they pushed the majority--Republican majority into passing a federal law mandating--unfunded mandate requiring electronic voting? You recall that? 
FITTON: Yes, many on the left objected to the outcome in Florida and how it was determined. And obviously, that was impacted by the controversy over paper ballots. So there was this push for electronic voting. 
Generally speaking, all the voting machines that were engineered as a result of that money, they're all--they're all getting old and they all need to be replaced and there is no secure way to vote over the internet. We don't have the technology to do it. We don't have the competency to do it. And the least second most secure way to vote is over the mail. If you want to vote, if you want to be sure your vote is counted, the best way to do it is to show up and vote. And to hear inflammatory rhetoric that you're choosing your life over your vote, it's just not appropriate and it causes people to be nervous about voting. 
That is as suppressive as anything I've heard, telling people, they're going to die or likely to die if they vote. We can see that people will exercise their first amendment rights if they think it's important, voting is important, and they will vote in person--they should be able to vote in person without being scared to death about doing it. 
GOHMERT: Well, we've already heard in this hearing that we watched Wisconsin voters getting sick and that occurred on April 7, 2020. But they--my understanding was Wisconsin held that vote without the mail-in mandate and actually they did not see a spike in COVID-19 cases. Are you familiar with what happened in Wisconsin? 
FITTON: I'm not--I'm not aware of any public health impact to voting in person and the COVID pandemic is receding. We now know that the concerns about it were largely overblown. If you have true concerns in many states, you can vote by absentee ballot. 
Frankly, I think absentee ballots are too readily available but the law is what it is. And this is a solution in search of a problem. If you want to vote by mail, you likely can. So let's stop fooling people and let's start preparing for the election rather than trying to upend the election. The time has passed. (INAUDIBLE--) 
GOHMERT: --As my time expires, I needed to ask unanimous consent. This is exhibit--authored by Kristian Adams and (AUDIO GAP) Spikowski (SP), COVID-19 and Ebola: What We Can Learn from Prior Elections. I ask that be made part of the record without objection. 
COHEN: Without objection, it'll be done. 
GOHMERT: And I meant to get to Mr. Adams, but my time is expired. Thank you. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Gohmert. You're ahead of me on the time clock. Is--Mr. Raskin this next. Five minutes. 
RASKIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And our GOP colleagues have started with praise of you so I'm going to start with a word about Mr. Johnson because I'm always carried away with his eloquence. But I was especially struck today that he began by denouncing the cold-blooded murder of George Floyd by Officer Chauvin. And he also called and I wrote it down, but please correct me if I got it wrong, Mr. Johnson. He called for transformative solutions for systemic change, which is a beautiful phrase that I'm going to hang on to whether or not he actually said it, but I think that he did. 
But with that, I think I've got to depart from my friend from Louisiana because he--when he started to talk about elections, he lost me. He said, states know best on how to run their elections. Well, of course, that's true, but states also know best how to steal elections, how to suppress the vote, how to depress the vote, and how to disenfranchise African Americans and racial minorities. So when he says this is no time to upend elections in America, my friend, the elections in America have been upended by the COVID crisis. And we don't have to get into a blame game about whether--you know, you think that Donald Trump has engaged in the most exquisite and perfect management of pandemic American history or you think it's been an absolute debacle. 
Regardless of where you want to pin responsibility, we've lost more than 105,000 of our people, 2 million people have been sickened, 40 million people have been thrown out of work. And the elections have been thrown into disarray, not by any of the secretaries of State like the wonderful secretary of State we just seen from Michigan or any of the voting rights activists. They've been thrown into disarray by COVID 19. Ohio had to close 125 polling places because they were in retirement homes or senior living centers. 
We've seen tremendous poll worker shortages across the country because most poll workers are retirees. They are older Americans and many of them are following the Center for Disease Control recommendation not to go outside to be in groups. Sixteen states, including my own Maryland, have had to postpone their primaries and when one was prevented from doing so, Wisconsin, we ended up with 71 cases of COVID-19 of people who stood in those long lines wrapped around the block as they struggled to get into, I think it was four or five polling places in all of Milwaukee, as many, many polling places didn't open in the state of Wisconsin because there was nobody to run them. 
So come on, get real and to have Mr. Fitton come out here and say that concerns about COVID-19 are overblown is just extraordinary and baffling to me. I suppose no one in his family or no one he knows has been affected by COVID-19. But the idea that the concerns have been overblown is just outrageous. 
Now let me start a question for Mr. Ho. You said something that was really astounding. You said that the Republican National Committee had sent out a mailer saying that mail-in voting is an easy and secure way to vote. And yet the Republican witnesses today are testifying against the vote by mail and are undermining vote by mail. Can you explain that? Did you get that wrong? 
Are you misquoting them, Mr. Ho? 
HO: No, there's a mailer that the Republican National Committee sent to all Republican voters in Pennsylvania, which I cited and include a screenshot of in my written testimony, encouraging voters to vote by mail, celebrating the fact that everyone in Pennsylvania can do so, and assuring them that it is a convenient--a convenient and secure way to cast your ballot. This is not--aside from a few voices, this is not a partisan issue. States across the political spectrum have no-excuse absentee voting. Many states, again, across the political spectrum are going farther than that and mailing valid applications to all voters. States like Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, West Virginia, and most recently, Wisconsin. I think everyone understands it's common sense to help Americans vote securely and safely in this election. 
RASKIN: Thank you. And if I could shift to Stacey Abrams, just picking up on what Mr. Ho said, I understand 33 states have vote by mail, voting from home option. That's 66 percent or 2/3 of the states. You say that all Americans should have a vote by mail option and if the vast majority of people already have a vote by mail option, where is the opposition coming from? This is just bizarre to me. 
ABRAMS: Thirty-four states have no-excuses vote by mail, 16 states have some version of vote by mail. So all 50 states plus the District of Columbia offer vote by mail. The challenge is the access. And it's those states that have constrained access or those states that need to scale up, who's going to request it. We saw this play out yesterday in Pennsylvania where the number of people requesting vote by mail because they then outstripped the capacity of the states to meet the need. 
The issue is not that it can't be done. It's that the states require support to make it so and we need guardrails. And just to address the question, it is not--we are not trying to force states to all conform in exact ways to the same elections. But we're trying to set a floor for what the basic understanding of being able to participate in our democracy looks like in the midst of a pandemic. We're setting a floor, not a ceiling. 
RASKIN: Thank you. And finally-- 
COHEN: --Your time is up, Mr. Raskin. I'm sorry. 
RASKIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
COHEN: You're welcome. Next is--is Mr. Collins from Georgia. Welcome back. 
COLLINS: Thank you, Chairman. It's good to see you again. And I look forward to the time when we can do this in person as we go forward. 
It's been really interesting to me and it was interesting that my friend Mr. Raskin, we've--we've engaged in rhetorical (INAUDIBLE) together for many years now. And it's interesting, though, that just is--what I just saw went from praising work that we can all do together, which needs to happen on the issue of police action, which I'm encouraging our chairman. I'm glad to hear we're going to have a hearing next week on that because what happened in Minneapolis was nothing but murder. And we've seen it in Georgia, down here and other places where we just have our--our society has to come to grips with this and you, I think, Mr. Cohen, and--and others, Ms. Jackson Lee and others, were on the police working group that we had a few years ago, and we need to continue that. So I'm glad the chairman is--is looking for that. That's what needs to happen. 
But today's flourishes is interesting to me and I am concerned about the--the discussion here going forward because the wording that is used here is something that is bothersome in the sense of let's take what actually is happening. Let's take mine and Ms. Abram's home state of Georgia. And the interesting issue here is is that we have been working and unfortunately, Georgia because of, frankly, because of some things that have been said by Ms. Abrams and others in the media throughout the country, has been held up as a place in which suppression and voters were not encouraged to vote. And the simply the numbers don't show that. 
In fact, from 2014 to 2018, African American, male and female went up 12 percent, 14 percent, 13 percent of white male, 16 percent against female, white, and Hispanic voter participation has increased from 18 to 24 percent in our state of Georgia. When we look at this and we're talked about the no excuse voting, which again, I go back to--and a quick question here because I have a question because I know that Ms. Abrams is very precise in her wording and you use in your wording in your opening statement, uncontroverted. And I would assume, Ms. Abrams, that you would agree with me that uncontroverted means it is with truth and validity not disputed or not. Correct? That's a question. 
ABRAMS: I was attempting to turn my mic--my microphone on. 
COLLINS: Okay. I have that problem--I have that problem too. 
ABRAMS: As to the definition of the word uncontroverted, yes, I would agree with your definition. 
COLLINS: Okay. Well, then the question is and this came up several times here, we keep bringing up Wisconsin. Yet a Stanford and World Health Organization study that says that there is no correlation between rising and COVID cases in Wisconsin because of the voting. There may have been more, 71 cases, as you said, but there's not been no rise overall. And the question is of those 71, can it be definitively determined that they caught at the voting place? So it's very interesting we should say this--this is uncontroverted in your wording was it would broke your heart to see them as standing along lines. Did it also break your heart to see folks standing in long lines in Fulton County and Dekalb County because local officials there chose to limit their voting machines and limit their polling locations? 
We need to make sure that we continue this process and honest discussion and not rhetoric that tends to scare people. The question that comes into my mind here and now--and I want to--to go back, there was a discussion and it's been stated by some of the Democratic members, it's been stated by the chairman earlier, it's been stated by you, Ms. Abrams, and others that the--you are being forced to choose, forced to choose. And we just got off the--the discussion of Mr. Ho and he was talking about how many and you actually told as well. How many have no-excuse absentee voting? 
Now, I will agree with you that there are other people that may have--that those voting premises need to be encouraged. I would encourage that. Everybody needs to vote. But my question is, where's the choice to put your life in danger if in this--as in our home state of Georgia, anyone can request an absentee ballot and get it? Where are we--is that not just use of overblown language to say that in states like Georgia and others to make a political point that we're just saying nobody can vote that seems as a contradiction? Ms. Abrams, you want to answer that? 
ABRAMS: I--I will try to address all of the questions. First and foremost, the 70--the number of 71 cases have been directly related to April 7th according to the Wisconsin State Journal, which is in my testimony. Number two, no one has claimed that voting has created an overwhelming majority of cases but there is a direct correlation and that is uncontroverted based on the evidence before us. As to-- 
COLLINS: --I'll stop you there. Ms. Abrams--Ms. Abrams, can I ask this because I wanna go back some? Because uncontroverted means not disputed and you're a fabulous attorney. I've known you for a long time but I will say that and somebody will politically use it against me. But I'm gonna say this, you understand that they're saying that April 7 is the start date for those all 71 to have received the virus at that time, that is probably not a provable statement and just keep stating it is a provable fact is not being a forthright and honest discussion of what happened in Wisconsin? 
ABRAMS: To continue my response, the issue of who has a choice to vote, it is not a choice if you apply for an absentee ballot but the infrastructure of the state is insufficient to meet your request. That is the reason for the request for funding. Because in the state of Georgia, for example, yes, millions of people have requested a ballot but not everyone has received it because the state does not have the funding at the local or state-level to meet the needs. And that's going to be expanded when we get to November. 
But I not only represent the state of Georgia, the work I do is across the entire United States. And so I speak for voters in every single state in our nation, particularly voters of color who wish to use this choice to vote by mail but may not be able to if their state is insufficiently funded to exercise the right to vote. 
COLLINS: Well, I agree with that. I-- 
COHEN: --Mr. Collins, your five minutes is up and I thank you. 
COLLINS: I yield back. Thank you. 
COHEN: You're welcome, sir. Thank you, Ms. Abrams. Next is on the Democrat side, Mr. Swalwell. 
SWALWELL: All right. Thank you, Chairman, and I think it would be a tone-deaf if we didn't recognize the moment our country is in right now. And I do welcome the opportunity in a bipartisan way for this committee to live up to the role that it's played in the past, to work on civil rights legislation to protect black Americans from police abuses, continued police abuses. 
But going to voting, which of course, relates to the plight of African Americans in our country. I want to ask Ms. Abrams. You're familiar with HR 1, the For the People Act and I just want to know, in Georgia, what would that legislation, if it was signed into law, what would it mean for an upcoming Georgia election considering some of the voting abuses we've seen in your state in the past? 
ABRAMS: Thank you, Representative Swalwell. I wanted to--I want to address a statement made earlier which is that there is some correlation between increased participation and the absence of suppression. In fact, we know that in the United States often we see as a response to suppression an attempt to respond by increasing presence. That does not mean that every person who attempts to participate is allowed to do so. That is the moral equivalent, as I've said before this committee--to this committee that because more people get into the water and suddenly there are fewer sharks. That is not the correlation that we should use. And it is not the appropriate test of access to our democracy. 
What HR 1 it would provide is a solution to a number of challenges that folks in Georgia faced. Number one, automatic voter registration, and same-day registration would solve the challenge of exact match and the voter purges that have plagued the state of Georgia, particularly for African Americans in our state. The additional language that permits expanded access to the right to vote across the country would absolutely guarantee voters of color more direct access. 
Black and brown voters are the most likely to have their absentee ballots rejected. They're the most likely to be subjected to more restrictive voter ID laws. And let's be clear, there is no--there is absolutely no contest with a notion of being able to prove who you are. The challenge with voter ID laws is that they become more and more restrictive, thereby eliminating people who should otherwise be able to cast the ballot, including a 100-year-old woman in the state of Wisconsin who when they passed their law because she could not provide a birth certificate because she was born during segregation in Missouri was disallowed from voting for the first time in more than a decade. 
That is the challenge that gets addressed by HR 1. We remove the barriers to voting, we remain protective of our democracy but we also expand access to everyone who is eligible to participate. 
SWALWELL: Ms. Abrams, does voting by mail go as far back as the Civil War. 
ABRAMS: It doesn't indeed. Voting by mail-- 
SWALWELL: --Go ahead. 
ABRAMS: Yes. 
SWALWELL: And today, a soldier in Afghanistan who does not have a ballot box that they can go and vote at, are they voting by mail? 
ABRAMS: They are indeed. 
SWALWELL: And are their ballots--you know, any less secure than a vote by mail here at home? 
ABRAMS: They are not, in fact, under UOCAVA we've made appropriate mechanisms available in every single state to guarantee access to vote by mail, which is why the controversy around expanded access is so perplexing because we have states that permit it and what we're saying is that in the midst of a pandemic that has robbed most states of the economic resources they need, that the federal government as part of our mutual aid compact should step up and provide the resources necessary to allow every state to participate in our democracy. And that is why we have the United States, it is why we have this joint relationship between states and the federal government, and it has worked during the 1918 pandemic, during the Civil War, and it works every single election cycle for our military. 
SWALWELL: Did you know Ms. Abrams that last month in California's 25th congressional district, there was a 100 percent vote by mail election where the president said that it was going to be a fraudulent outcome and a Republican, Mike Garcia, was the winner. Did you know that? 
ABRAMS: Not only is that true but we know in the state of Utah they use 100 percent vote by mail. Vote by mail does not privilege one community over the other but equal access guarantees that there's equal participation and that should be the goal of a democracy. 
SWALWELL: And, Ms. Abrams, are you aware of any recent polling about support for voting from home by the American people? 
ABRAMS: According to The Washington Post/ABC News poll, it is a two to one margin of support for vote by mail because people do not want to have to make the choice of risking their lives, even on the most infinitesimal chance when there is a--there's a logical and logistical way to solve the problem. And particularly because it protects then those who have no choice but to vote in person. 
SWALWELL: Thank you, Ms. Abrams, and thank you to our--our witnesses. I yield back. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Swalwell. 
I want to thank the Republicans for allowing us to move to this hearing up an hour so that Ms. Abrams could participate. She has to leave at, I believe it's at noon, one o'clock maybe Eastern time. If Mr. Armstrong, Mr. (INAUDIBLE), Mr. Armstrong our Democrat has a question for Ms. Abrams, you could ask it now and then that time will be taken from the time you have your five minutes. Mr. Armstrong, do you have a question? 
ARMSTRONG: I don't. 
COHEN: Thank you, sir. Does a Democrats have a question for Ms. Abrams? If not, we'll proceed to Mr. Cline. And if you would ask Ms. Abrams, if you'd ask at first and then we'll proceed on just on. Mr. Cline, you're recognized for five minutes. 
CLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for your opening remarks and for the opening prayer and our thoughts and prayers are with the American people during this difficult time. 
It's an unprecedented time in the history of our nation. In the midst of a global pandemic, citizens will be asked to do their civic duty by participating in elections not just in November but in primaries and in local elections. And just last month, cities and towns in my home state of Virginia held local elections and not only did they appear to have been held without incident but in some cases, the turnout was higher than it in previous elections. 
COVID-19 has changed how we live our lives with every decision we make, weighing the risks of our actions, whether it's grocery shopping, planning, doctor's visits, and even now voting. As Election Day approaches, it's important for us to consider what we can do to ensure that it's conducted safely, securely, with strong protections against fraud, and (AUDIO GAP) with accuracy. 
While I believe that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would agree with those goals, I am concerned that HR 1 and their proposal to federalize essentially our election process would largely impede those goals. The Constitution does state with the responsibility to administer elections, that's because each state is best positioned to run their own elections. And even more concerning the prospect of losing a state's ability to best address the needs of their own citizens and localities is the potential of fraud federalizing elections could cause or encouraged. 
Although I support absentee balloting and support recent efforts in Virginia to move to an all absentee or no-excuse absentee balloting, I'm concerned with some of the proposals for mail-in voting especially as it applies to those states that don't have updated voter rolls. When you vote in Virginia absentee, the voter must request the absentee ballot, they have to fill out the ballot in the presence of a witness, although during COVID-19 that's been waived, and they must sign the envelope before returning it to the registrar. We take appropriate measures to ensure that anyone who needs an absentee ballot receives one and anyone who returns a completed absentee ballot has their vote counted. 
You know as the U.S. Election Assistance Commission has noted, maintaining accurate voter registration lists is essential to protecting election integrity. And that's where we have differing standards all around the country. While COVID-19 has presented us with challenges, Congress has stepped up and acted by passing the CARES Act, which provides around $400 million to help states and to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus domestically and internationally for the 2020 federal election cycle. 
And I want to ask Mr. Fitton, it's been suggested that states when an election is held in an area in which an emergency or disaster is declared, automatically mail absentee ballots to registered voters in that area. Do you have any concerns with that proposal or with an all mail-in voting requirement, absence, updating the voter registration rolls? 
FITTON: Yes, specifically in California, we have a settlement with the state of California-Los Angeles County they were--where they are removing right now up to 1.6 million names from their roles. Our analysis from last year found 14 counties totaling over a million extra names on the roll. So in theory, all those folks would get ballots because they're still registered to vote and Newsome's plan, aside from its legality, whether he has the authority to do it, it's bad policy. 
I understand that we need to be prepared for a potential surge in absentee ballot requests. But it's the wrong way to vote if you're concerned about secure voting. It should be resolved--it should be reserved for emergency situations, our military deployed overseas, and if you want your vote to be secure and counted the best way to ensure that is to go and vote in person. 
And we have these concerns about COVID-19. How does that comport with this massive push for a ballot harvesting which is illegal virtually everywhere? Ballot harvesting means people going around and taking ballots in person from people. 
This is--this is a--this is the old adage never let a crisis go to waste and the left is doing it here. It's--it's going to--what this debate is undermining our confidence in elections because it's confusing people. They can vote in person. They can pursue mail-in ballots as appropriate if they need to. But we should be encouraging people to vote in person. That's the best way to be sure that your votes are secure and counted. 
CLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time, I'm gonna yield back. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Cline, very much. Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee has a question for Ms. Abrams. If she would ask that briefly to Ms. Abrams. 
JACKSON LEE: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Ms. Abrams, thank you so very much. 
How important is it to ensure that in a mail ballot program, that individuals who receive that then desire to vote in person that there is protection for that individual, those individuals? Was I heard? 
COHEN: Is Ms. Abrams still with us? 
UNKNOWN: No. 
COHEN: She left. I'm sorry, Congresswoman Lee, I didn't see your request in time until after we had gotten started. So (INAUDIBLE) will be taken from you and we will now recognize Ms. Scanlon for five minutes. 
SCANLON: Thank you very much. I'm honored to be able to participate in this first virtual hearing by the Constitutional Subcommittee of House Judiciary. It's so important that Congress be able to conduct its essential business for the American people at a time when one of the most essential things that we can do is to limit the spread of COVID-19 and protect those whose physical presence is essential by maintaining social distancing whenever we can. And of course, there's an obvious parallel between this virtual hearing and one of the central topics in our discussion today, which is the important role of voting by mail to allow voters to exercise their essential constitutional right while maintaining social distancing during a public health emergency. 
I represent Pennsylvania and has been noted by several speakers, we had our primary election yesterday. Last year, in its wisdom, the Pennsylvania legislature overwhelmingly passed broad voting return--reforms, including no-excuse mail-in ballots. And they did so on a strong bipartisan basis, 70 percent of both houses. Yesterday was the first opportunity for voters to use the system and there's no denying that there were some challenges in implementing it, largely because of the COVID-19 epidemic, which has killed more than 6,000 Pennsylvanians already. 
We had almost 2 million Pennsylvanians apply for mail-in ballots. And while this presented logistical challenges, by and large, it ran smoothly and we're all going to be working together, state, local, and federal to improve the process for the fall. One thing that was absolutely clear was the need for additional resources for scanning, printing, and processing these ballots. 
One of the biggest issues we had at the polls yesterday was staffing. Given the disparate impact of COVID-19 on the seniors who we typically rely upon to staff our polling places. Many polling places had to be consolidated. And so I got a message from a friend who was working at the polls yesterday and she was really shocked and horrified by how many people refused to vote by mail and instead clogged the polling places because they'd heard the president's derogatory statements about voting by mail. She said that--you know, she's really concerned as a health care professional that the lack of adequate mail-in voting is going to trigger another wave of Coronavirus in our region and we've just come out of a peak. We would like to avoid another One. 
It was interesting. Last week on my way back from our voting session in DC I heard the Republican Secretary of State in Washington share her state's success with mail-in voting in an NPR interview entitled Lessons to Learn from Washington State's Decades-Long Experience of Mail-In Voting. And I'd ask unanimous consent to enter that transcript in the record. 
COHEN: Without objection, it'll be done. 
SCANLON: Thank you. 
I wanted to turn for a minute to the issue of disability voting. Ms. Bishop, even under normal circumstances, without a pandemic raging, our voting systems are often inaccessible for individuals with disabilities and I introduced the Disabilities Voting Rights Act, which was included in HR 1, to try to get our state and federal officials to invest in mail-in voting and making polling locations more accessible. Can you speak to concrete steps we should be taking to ensure that voting during this pandemic is accessible and that individuals with disabilities are not prevented from participating and vote? 
BISHOP: Absolutely. We talked a lot--and thank you for that question. We talked a lot today about the importance of mailing voting as a way to keep voting safe, especially to deter congestion at the polls and I think that's critical during COVID-19. But what we can't overlook here is even the way we describe mail-in voting, voting by mail. What we're essentially describing is a paper ballot that's inherently inaccessible to people with disabilities. And I think the most obvious example of that if I were a voter who was blind and I went to my polling place, and you gave me a paper ballot in the pen, and you asked me to market it privately and independently, which is my right under federal law, I can't do that. So if you mail the same ballot to my home, I don't magically regain my vision when I sit down at my kitchen table. That ballot is still inaccessible to me. 
We have to have options that make mail-in voting accessible to people with disabilities. Unfortunately, they exist and they've been in use for years, particularly in states that have prominent vote by mail systems. And honestly, any state that under the MOVE Act has to provide it for our military and our overseas voters. Electronic delivery of blank ballots and remote accessible vote by mail systems are making it significantly more accessible for people with disabilities to access vote by mail. It's not a quick fix. It doesn't make it fully accessible for all voters. But it does drastically improve the accessibility which in the time of COVID-19 means that more voters will be able to opt to vote by mail and won't be forced to make that decision to go to the polls and risk their health to be able to cast their ballots. 
So it's critical that any states that don't currently offer electronic ballot delivery broadly to their voters, expand it right now and make that an option for all voters. 
SCANLON: Thank you, and I believe my time is expired. So I'll yield back. 
COHEN: Thank you, Ms. Scanlon. Our next up questioner will be Mr. Armstrong. And Mr. Armstrong thank you. You're recognized for five minutes. 
ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks for having this hearing. It gives me my 
sporadic opportunity to educate people on how we do things in North Dakota. 
And I think I would start with saying there truly are no federal elections. There are only local elections that elect federal officers and I--and federal--federal elected officials. And I know that because North Dakota has probably the easiest voting in the entire country. We have no voter registration. We have a 30-day residency requirement. We allow felons to vote when they are out of prison and we're proud of all of those things. And I think that is one of the problems I have and have significantly with how we are doing this and just to be clear during this primary during COVID, we are doing vote by mail throughout the whole state. It was actually fairly easy for us to set up because we have significant--a number of vote by mail counties already that are almost exclusively vote by mail. 
But as is always the case, when we try and do these things from a federal level, when we are attempting to solve (AUDIO GAP) a perceived problems somewhere else, it will cause problems in places like mine. There are things we do very well but we do them in the aspect of being a very, very rural state. Requiring 20-days early voting in a state--in a county with 700 people doesn't make any sense. And, in fact, we have spent many years in different counties, in different jurisdictions to get this right. We have--we have places--we have places that are--that have extended early voting and then we have places that shorten it up but have it open significantly outside business hours. We do a lot of those things. 
The other thing we do with all absentee and early voting is require that it's postmarked the day before the election. North Dakotans want to know the result of their election on election day. But just other things that exist in all of these different proposals that make it difficult. Mandating that when a declared emergency exists that it's automatically vote by mail is pretty interesting for us. What most people call weather emergencies we usually call Tuesday. In varying degrees in some place or another within our state our--there is a--or there is a federally declared emergency whether it's for drought, flood, blizzard, all of those different things. 
These proposals forbid ID requirements for vote by mail. We need voter id because we don't have voter registration it would be contrary to--contrary to North Dakota State law. And there's--there's a conflict with all of those different things. 
But as--and as we spend so much time talking about how we deal with voter registration and the different issues involved in that, again, North Dakota doesn't have it. And so we deal with different things. And I have to say too, even as we're doing this right now in North Dakota, you want your population to have confidence in the bow--in the voting process. And in our--in our Secretary of State's zeal and effort, which I applaud to ensure that everybody had the opportunity to vote. I should also say that this--if more than 3/4 of the ballots that have been requested by absentee voting in North Dakota are returned, this will be our higher voter--highest voter turnout in the--in the history. 
I anticipate that probably won't be the case and we'll be closer to at are slightly above average. But when we do this, we are--I mean we are seeing and this is, I mean people are getting ballots sent to their house, ballot applications sent to their house for people who haven't lived there in three generations. And those--and those types of things cause voters to cause concern over that. And we need to continue to move forward. 
So I guess my question for either--well, I suppose Mr. Fitton, as we nationalize these things for a state like North Dakota, we would have to completely revamp how we do our voting. And in our case, it would actually be more restrictive, not--not less to our citizens, isn't that correct? 
FITTON: Yes, that's the concern here. You have this national plan that is being proposed that would upend the voting laws in all states in some form or another. And from our perspective, most importantly, the laws that secure the votes such as voter ID laws--you know, most Americans support voter ID in significant numbers, both Republican and Democrat. And--you know, this is a non-controversial issue other than some hardcore activists on one side, who oppose voter ID using fraudulent numbers and reasons for doing so in my view. 
Look, you should be able to vote in November. We all agree on that. We want people to be safe. We also want the votes to be secure. Blowing up the system now is the wrong thing to do, whether at the national level, or even state by state, where you get confusion reigning as opposed to reassuring voters their votes will be counted in the ordinary course, in the ordinary way, just phone as you normally are used to doing so and we'll get through it. The hearing now is an effort to disrupt the elections not to secure them. 
COHEN: Thank you, Mr. Armstrong, your five minutes are up. I now have another reason to think well of North Dakota other than what used to be called small college football, ice hockey, and those are the two I mostly know. And now voting. Y'all do great. Thank you. 
ARMSTRONG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
COHEN: You're welcome, sir. Thank you very much. 
Next is Ms. Dean for five minutes. 
DEAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you and the ranking member for your thoughtful opening to this first hearing of our subcommittee. I'm pleased to be a part of it a mindful of the moment of extraordinary difficulty in our country and in our world. 
I'm going to start with my first question, if I may, for Secretary of State Benson. As my friend and colleague Mary Gay Scanlon pointed out, yesterday was primary election day here in Pennsylvania delayed due to the pandemic. It was a test to see how prepared we are in managing for November's general election. It's a tough time for every state. We're figuring things out as we go and naturally, they're going to be some problems. 
For example, a good problem is 161,000 folks in my county of Montgomery County applied for mail-in ballot. This is the first time we've had that opportunity. The county had estimated perhaps maybe 20 or 30,000 based on 2016 absentee ballots of only 9,000. So instead a whopping 161,000 voters sought to seek a mail-in ballot. Unfortunately, some of the problems that we've experienced and they're--they're learning is that for some voters, their ballots went out by market mail instead of being marked priority mail. For those who aren't familiar, that's the same type of postage indicia that would be spam mail, delaying its delivery for as long as 10 to 14 days, if not more. Some of my own constituents, including a member of my own staff, did not get their ballot in time for this election, even though they applied in time. 
So there's lots of problems that we can expect that is just one important one. But, Secretary, from your experience, as you pointed out, printing more ballots costs money, mailing more ballots costs money, ensuring our polling places are safe and well-equipped cost money. Our postal services on the front lines and needs resources. And our local and federal--our local and state governments need our federal support. 
Secretary, as the official responsible for administering your state's elections, in what areas or issues of election administration have you felt those lack of resources? 
BENSON: Thank you very much for your question and for pointing out exactly what we've learned here in Michigan. Which is that with resources, with sufficient funding (INAUDIBLE) the solutions to address a lot of these concerns are out there and can be implemented but lacking those resources you will lead to--it's hard to adapt a system that previously was primarily in-person to a system that is predominantly voting by mail quickly. 
Now we were able to do that in Michigan. In 2018, voters amended our law similar to Pennsylvania, which I know was a new law to have a right to vote by mail. And so like many other states, we saw a significant influx in our March 10 presidential primary and anticipating another influx in the fall of people voting by mail. But the benefit that we in Pennsylvania and other states have is that states like Colorado and Washington as was mentioned earlier, Oregon and--and even to a certain extent California have been doing this work, have been allowing vote by mail robust systems in their states for decades. 
And so we have an opportunity to learn both from their mistakes and their best practices and with appropriate resources, import a lot of the systems they've developed, the technology that they use, the people and the people power that is necessary as well, and the education tools that is needed to ensure voters know what their choices are, what their options are, and that they're empowered to fix challenges if they don't receive their ballot on time, which for many different variables can oftentimes occur despite the best intentions of everyone involved. 
So we cannot make the importance of these resources in solving--enabling us to anticipate and solve these problems to be fully prepared for November. And the HEROES Act, it does provide sufficient resources, I believe, to enable us all to do that. 
DEAN: Not only for state and local governments but also for the postal service, which I'll continue to fight for. I know we all will. 
Can you--you began in your opening statement talking about some of the particular challenges of communities of colors--color or economically disadvantaged communities, perhaps, Flint. Can you--can you point out some of the difficulties in making sure folks have full access to mail-in and in-person voting? 
BENSON: The difficulties are both expounded by inequality and an access to resources but also historical disenfranchisement and historical disconnect and lack of responsiveness from the government officials and systems that are meant to use serve and protect these residents. And so we're fighting decades generations of trauma and as we're seeing across this country now that the need to effectively do more to better serve communities of color and historically marginalized and disenfranchised communities, also is underscored at the ballot box. And it's why this has been at the heart of my work in so many others in the voting rights arena. 
Recognizing that as has been mentioned in many different ways today, there is no one size fits all approach to ensuring every vote is counted in every voice is heard. It takes every one of us working together at the local level, at the state level, community leaders, other voices--trusted voices to educate voters about their rights and ensure they know the choices. It takes election officials administrators preparing an infrastructure that can embrace and serve meeting voters where they're at to enable all choices to be fully valid in successful ways to cast a vote. And then it also takes all of us fighting back against efforts to deceive particularly communities of color but all voters about their rights and their access to the vote issue now more than ever. 
All of this does take resources. But also everyone in this hearing today and everyone watching has a platform that they can also use to dispel myths and encounter efforts to misinform the public with facts about the realities that we're all doing to ensure everyone's voice is heard. And--and so I think that's why these conversations and this work is also important, in addition to those resources. 
COHEN: I think our time is up. We're way beyond. Thank you very much. Our next--our next questioner will be Ms. Garcia. 
GARCIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the ranking member. I thought that the comments that you made opening up our hearing were not only thoughtful but just another reminder of what has shaken our country to its core with the tragic death of George Floyd. 
You know, I'm a person to faith from an early age. My faith has taught me that we're all God's children. Certainly, George Floyd was not treated as a child of God that he is. The color of one's skin should not determine the justice they receive. Likewise, it should not determine the access to the ballot box that you get. 
Recently, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that if a voter fears contracting COVID-19, that this does not qualify as a disability. It is intentionally confusing in an effort to mislead voters into not requesting a mail-in ballot. Nevertheless, decision--the decision also made it clear that voters can apply for mail-in ballot if they believe the risk COVID-19 is significant. Mr. Chairman, the Texas Supreme Court issued this decision virtually, presumably from home or their offices because they consider or they're concerned for their own well-being and for their own health. So why shouldn't they hold the same standards for safety and well-being for all Texas voters? 
This is not a time for political games in the middle of a pandemic. We should not be misleading voters into falsely choosing between their health and voting. That is why on April 2, I read a letter to the governor and the secretary of State of Texas, urging them to implement a no-excuse vote by mail for all elections in the state of Texas until the end of this year, while still preserving in--in-person voting as long as in-person voting locations are structured to respond to public health concerns. 
I think this is what many of us are saying. We're not trying to do away with in-person voting, we just want to ensure that in-person voting is safe and healthy for everyone. But that everyone also receives the option by voting from home. We are banking from home, we are shopping from home, we're buying groceries from home, we're ordering food from home, we're doing everything from home. So frankly, it makes sense that we also vote from home. 
Mr. Chairman, I do at this time want to ask unanimous consent to introduce into the record my letter to the governor and the secretary of State of Texas. 
COHEN: Without objection, it will be introduced. 
GARCIA: Thank you. And I want to begin Mr. Chairman, with my first question for Ms. Perez. Ms. Perez, are you familiar with this Texas case? And is this just but one example of the reason that we need a federal standard if you will, on eligibility for stay at home voting to ensure that one state is not doing one thing and other states are relaxing rules and can vote during this pandemic without--without any real excuse because of a fear of a virus? 
PEREZ: Yes, Ms. Garcia. As you may remember, I am from Texas. I'm from San Antonio. 
GARCIA: (INAUDIBLE) already. 
PEREZ: Yes, We certainly need to make sure that there are minimum standards so that it doesn't matter where you live, you will be entitled to the basic ability to cast a ballot that will count. And one of the things that the Brennan Center has done has been to check which states have different policies that are needed in order to make sure that no voter's left behind. I have submitted that in the record and I would encourage you all to take a look at it. 
One of the things that I'm finding so interesting about this conversation, is that all of the dispute over whether or not we need to have basic minimum standards is one policy question. But the other policy question is if you want states and localities to play the role that they want to play in making sure that no voter is left behind, please give them funding. They are asking for funding. They are telling Congress that they need more resources. 
So even if there's a debate over this, that or the other, there should be no debate among any member on this committee that we are all better off if state and local election administrators have the resources that they need. At this point in the game, them having the resources will automatically make elections a bit better. And we can do more if there are minimum standards. But as a baseline, I'm hoping and I'm hearing that there's a commonality for wanting to support our state and local election administrators. And I'm hoping that this--members of this committee go and do everything that they can to make sure that those state and local election administrators get the extra $4 billion that they need. 
GARCIA: Thank you, Chairman. I see I'm out of time. I do have a couple other questions and I'll submit them later for--to the record. 
COHEN: Thank you, Miss Garcia. And I did mention when you asked to have something admitted to the record, I said it, it's granted or admitted but it's admitted. 
GARCIA: Thank you. Thank you. 
COHEN: You're welcome. Ms. Escobar, you are next. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to all of our panelists, this is such an important conversation. And, Mr. Chairman, thank you for opening up our conversation today acknowledging what is happening in the world around us right now. And I think that that's part of why it's so confusing to me as to what the controversy is surrounding making it easier for people to be safe and to participate in their elections. 
As a reminder, this global pandemic has taken over 100,000 American lives and counting. In my own county, for example, the numbers of deaths keep increasing every day. We know that--that if people are not socially distancing, they are putting themselves at risk. And there are certain communities and certain people who are more vulnerable than others. We know that the elderly are more vulnerable. We also know that people with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable. 
But there's a third group that is more vulnerable. And I think it's very important that we talk about it, especially because of what's happening in the country right now. That third group is minority populations, primarily Latinos and African Americans who are dying at disproportionately higher rates because they are more at risk. And I'm not going to take time going into why they are more at risk. But I would refer everyone to Dr. Fauci's comments about Latino and African American communities, which he says, by the way, are as vulnerable to COVID-19 as people who live in assisted living facilities. That's how vulnerable we are. 
So we've got to do everything possible. We have a fundamental obligation to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the people that we represent. 
Ms. Arnwine, I want to ask you a question. My first question. The State of Texas, my state of Texas, is unfortunately notorious for creating obstacles for voters. We rank right up there when it comes to voter suppression. We heard my colleague, Mr. Armstrong earlier talk about the really great work that his state is doing. And he used that as an example as to why we shouldn't federalize rules or regulations. But can you tell us, explain to the American public why we need the federal government to step in with resources and regulations, please? 
ARNWINE: Thank you so much for that question because we absolutely need to make sure that every single American is protected. There's so much confusion out there because different states do different things. It makes no sense that in Texas there's no--that the disability category for excused voting is so limited and that the Supreme Court couldn't give people clarity on what that means and instead told people well, we don't think you'll be prosecuted when the AG is threatened to prosecute everybody. It makes zero sense. It's unfair. It's unAmerican. 
We want to make sure that every American has the same rights. It's wrong that in North Carolina they say you got to have two witnesses in the COVID era and a notarization if you're going to have an absentee ballot. That makes zero sense. It's unfair, it's unsafe, and it's unAmerican. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you. 
ARNWINE: So-- 
ESCOBAR: --I'm so sorry, Ms. Arnwine, I want to get to one more question before my time runs out. Thank you for that response. 
Ms. Bishop, you talked about the need to have sort of a hybrid approach so that as many people as possible vote safely from their own home. So that the disabled would have the ability to go in-person. Can you describe for the American public why it's important to take that approach? 
BISHOP: And it was said earlier today by another one of our witnesses. Thank you for raising this issue again. But in order to really make our elections work for all voters, we have to be able to provide a broad range of options. There is no one size fits all way of voting that's going to work for everyone. Neither in-person voting nor vote by mail have honestly been made fully accessible for people with disabilities at this point, despite the fact that there are several federal laws that protect that right for them. 
So we have to be able to provide as many options as possible for people with disabilities. If we don't make our vote by mail as accessible as possible. They are not able to choose the safety of voting from their homes, which is a privilege for those who are non-disabled. But if we don't also make our in-person options available and as safe and as accessible as possible, people for whom vote by mail just simply does not work will not be able to cast their ballots. 
So it's critical that we're implementing electronic ballot delivery for vote by mail but also that we have in-person voting to the greatest extent possible. We have as many ballot marking devices or accessible voting stations as possible. We have a minimum of one machine per precinct is not sufficient and that we're leveraging curbside voting to reduce exposure to COVID-19. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you both so much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
COHEN: Thank you, Ms. Escobar. When I first saw you on the screen, I thought I've been in that house. (INAUDIBLE) 
(LAUGHTER) 
ESCOBAR: Thank you. 
COHEN: Next is Ms. Jackson Lee for five minutes. 
JACKSON LEE: Mr. Chairman, thank you so very much. And let me as well add my appreciation for the words of faith that you offered at the beginning and to thank you for mentioning the murder of our hometown son in George Floyd. I know that we in Houston and the nation appreciate your faith and your words. Let me also acknowledge the ranking member for expressing the importance of a systemic change that has to occur in this nation, as well as a cultural change. 
Let me ask unanimous consent to place this headline Houston Chronicle yesterday, Tens of Thousands March in Floyd's Name. In fact, it was 60,000 persons. I ask unanimous consent to place this in the record. 
COHEN: The action is so done. 
JACKSON LEE: Evidence is the fact that in the messages that came out of that were people's desire for change. That change comes about through the power of voting. That's why this hearing is so crucial to be able to assess how we ensure in 2020 voting for all Americans. My friends are correct. We have had a disparate impact of COVID-19 across the nation and right here. We have lost pastors and political activists, people you see every day who happened to be African American. 
So my first question is to Dale Ho. In light of the fact that the president has indicated that he plans to file lawsuits any a state that has a mail-in ballot that refuses or removes the restrictions as they should to adhere to the democracy of this nation. What restriction, what should Congress put in place? And how important as well, is the restoration of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act? Thank you, Mr. Ho. 
HO: Thank you very much for that question. Obviously, restoring the Voting Rights Act is of critical importance to voters all across this country. And I do think it is quite ironic that the one--on the one hand, some critics of congressional efforts to set minimum health and safety standards for voting during the pandemic on the grounds of state authority are at the very same time threatening the authority of states with federal litigation to try to stop those states from taking actions to facilitate safe and secure voting by mail. There's nothing to fear from helping Americans vote. 
JACKSON LEE: Thank you. So Congress needs to intervene I would take it and--and to assure that protection? 
HO: Well, I think Congress should set minimum standards for protecting health and safety and should do its best to make sure that state efforts to facilitate voting are not interfered with. But I just want to make one point clear, even if Congress does none of those things, we will see a record number of ballots cast by mail-in this election because the majority of states already allow for no-excuse absentee voting and more voters than ever want to use it. In Wisconsin, it was five times the number of voters than 2016. In Pennsylvania, 18 times. (INAUDIBLE) with that. 
JACKSON LEE: Thank you. Let me ask--to I believe, Ms. Bishop--Michelle Bishop. I am in total support of expanding the opportunities for voters with disabilities. One of the things that I've seen violated is the right of the voter to come to the polls and have curbside voting. I want to ensure that that is never undermined and done safely in light of COVID-19. Help us understand how important that is. 
And let me ask Ms. Arnwine just a specific question after Ms. Bishop--specific question on the voting. We know that the people impacted negatively on mass mail balloting happens to be African Americans for many cultural reasons. The ballot may come. They don't use it. They go to the polls and they're punished by not being able to vote. Think about how we have to protect minorities as relates to voting. 
Ms. Bishop, if you would answer the importance of this--those with disabilities but particularly the curbside voting, which I want to focus on. 
BISHOP: Yes, thank you for that question. Curbside voting. I think it's a largely misunderstood issue. It's actually a critical stopgap measure even outside of the conduct context of a global pandemic. We have not yet made America's polling places fully accessible to people with disabilities. In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office has studied this, most recently in 2016. They found that in terms of architectural access to a polling place, wide enough doorways, paths of travel, accessible parking, less than half of America's polling places were actually accessible. Only 40 percent. 
And unfortunately, that 40 percent is actually an all-time high. So that almost half is the best we've ever done realistically, it making all of our polling places accessible. We have to fix that but until we can, allowing people with disabilities to vote curbside, if they're not able to get into the polling place is an important way to make sure they're still able to cast their ballots. 
So regardless of COVID-19, curbside voting is a critical measure. I think it could also be really useful in the context of the pandemic as well because it allows you to reduce your exposure or potential exposure to COVID-19. If you're able to stay inside your vehicle, it's the same thing we see at COVID-19 testing centers (INAUDIBLE) drive-thru. 
COHEN: Thank you. Ms. Arnwine, would you address the same question? 
JACKSON LEE: The question of protecting black voters who come out with the mail ballot at their--at their home. Thank you. 
ARNWINE: Absolutely. And I've been dealing with this as you can imagine. They've been blowing up my phone and blowing up my email because the problems that blacks are having with the mail-in ballot problems around the country. One of the things that we know right now is that if you make people call in for an application for a ballot, that just doesn't work. Or if you tell them that they can print it out at home, remember 30 percent, 29 percent of all people in Philadelphia who are black do not even have internet access. So let's just start realistic. 
So one of the things that we have been pushing very strongly, as we've talked about today is that all states have to mail ballots, mail applications, have prepaid responses because those stamps confuse and that's another problem. 
The other thing is I want to join Michelle Bishop very strongly. Curbside voting works beautifully for people of color. Drop boxes, ballot collection right at the polling sites. All of these things are good and we got to have many multiple expanded options. That's what we need as a people. And I'm hearing--you know, so many problems because with bad voter education and states have not retooled their thinking about how to best reach--outreach to black people, how to educate them about mail-in balloting but also how to make it easy to do it. And I'm hearing from too many people who are really registered voters, I help them, I called up the boards of elections, and I've talked to them. And these are registered voters who got no mail ballot. (INAUDIBLE--) 
COHEN: --We're gonna have to wrap up. 
ARNWINE: Yes. 
COHEN: Thank you. (INAUDIBLE) 
Thank you, Congressman, again. Thank you for your words of comfort to the country. And I know you'll be in Houston for the funeral and I'm sorry about the loss of your constituent-- 
JACKSON LEE: (INAUDIBLE) 
COHEN: --members there. 
This concludes today's hearing. I started by sending out the right to vote has been diminished for years and it goes back to America's original sin inscribed in our Constitution, which we fought a Civil War over and still never overcame. It's been interesting in this hearing to hear that the five states with least access to voting by mail, my home state of Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas are all states that had slavery. It's interesting that--that there's some connection there. (INAUDIBLE) times they are not forgotten. 
With that, I want to thank our witnesses for appearing today. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or additional materials for the record. I want to thank the Republicans for allowing us to start early and facilitate Ms. Abrams's attendance. And with that, this hearing is adjourned. "

[*]JOHNSON: Good morning. This hearing will come to order. I want to first welcome and thank our witnesses, the Honorable Christopher Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Honorable Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and the Honorable Kenneth Cuccinelli, the senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary. 
This is our annual threat hearing. When I take a look at all the threats that this committee has considered and all the threats faced in this nation, I think it's pretty interesting, you know, how many hearings we've held on so many of these things. Before I proceed, I guess I would ask for unanimous consent to have my written opening statement be entered into the record. But if you consider these threats, for example, I'll just go down the list, cyberattacks--and these are cyberattack ransomware; intellectual property theft, something we're concerned about right now as we start trying to develop vaccines, but the hundreds of billions of dollars of economic loss due to intellectual property theft; you know, potential cyberattacks and threats against our critical infrastructure; drug trafficking and the overdose crisis; gangs like MS13; EMP and GMD threats to our electrical grid; the malign use of drones; human trafficking; election security; and school and other mass shootings. 
These are issues, these are threats that this committee has not only held hearings on, but passed some pretty significant pieces of legislation. One hearing we had talking about school shootings, we've had Luke Hoyer--or we've had the parents of Luke Hoyer and Max Schachter come in from Parkland, Florida to describe, you know, hopefully what could be some common sense solutions to help prevent or minimize the destruction from some of these mass shootings. 
And so as we consider all these things, and we'll be considering these today in our hearing, I do want to raise the troubling aspect of what's happening currently in the streets of America. As serious as all these threats that I just mentioned are, I have a growing fear that what is happening on the streets of America actually represent a greater threat to our long-term democracy. As Senator Peters pointed out yesterday, and I'm sure will point out again today, that the mass shootings over the last couple of years certainly have instead of being perpetrated by Islamist terror, there is a greater percentage, growing percentage, a majority now perpetrated by white supremacists. 
But as Acting Secretary Wolf said in our hearing yesterday, what's happening in terms of mass shootings over the last couple years is completely different about--versus what's happened in the last four months, and I just want to cite a study. This is published by U.S. Crisis Project. It was a joint effort by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project and Princeton University. And what this group did is they actually took a look at what's happening in the streets. They analyzed and they provided data on the last three months of demonstrations, and what they found is there have been more than 10,600 total. They also went back in July 2019 and said that on average for--at least for July, there were 1400 demonstrations in 2019. 
So you take a look at that, if you extrapolate and say well, a normal level of demonstrations every month is about--over three months would be 4200. So this year we've had 10,600, or an excess number of about 6400. They also analyzed who's protesting, who are these demonstrators. And about 7750 of those protests have been linked to Black Lives Matter in all 50 states and the DC. 
Now what they found is that of the 10,600, about 95 percent were peaceful. In other words, 5 percent turned violent, turned into some kind of riot. The peaceful ones were peaceful in about 2440 locations, but the 5 percent that turned violent, that ended up being a riot, where there was property destruction or loss of life, occurred in about 220 locations. Now I think as a report it is, is well, that's pretty minimal; it's only 5 percent turned violent. That represents almost 570 riots that occurred in this nation over the last three months that they studied, 500--almost 570. 
And we've seen loss of life. We've seen destruction of property. In my own state in Wisconsin, in Kenosha, the protests turned into property destruction, dozens of businesses burned down, the downtown all boarded up. And of course the final night of those riots two people tragically lost their lives--life, as well. And so now we've just seen in Louisville last night, where two police officers were shot, and our thoughts and prayers go out to them and their families for a speedy and full recovery. 
But why did that--first of all, why were those people protesting? Why did that turn into a riot? Well, they were protesting because they didn't agree with our system of justice where a grand jury took a look at all the evidence and, you know, brought forward an indictment, but it just wasn't the indictment or enough indictments that they wanted, so rather than accepting our judicial system that has served this nation well for as long as we've been a nation, these individuals turned to rioting and turned to destruction. 
So what I'd like to do right now and ask the Senate recording studio to play a short little video of a supposedly peaceful protest following President Trump's acceptance speech at the White House. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
Now fortunately, Senator Paul, his wife Kelley and their guests were not harmed, but they were scared, you know, unbelievably. And they had every right to be frightened by how they were accosted and how they were threatened. That is not a peaceful protest. And you know, the fact of the matter is, when you take a look at these statistics from this center, they didn't even--they found--the study found that there were no riots in Seattle's Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, CHOP, or the nation (PH) formerly known as CHAZ. So I'm not exactly sure of these statistics, but once again, 570 peaceful protests turned into rioting, turned into property destruction and loss of life. 
And oh by the way, you know, I can see the point that the mass shootings are--a majority of those come from white supremacists. Those people--and by the way I denounce white supremacists. I am not defending them in any way, shape or form. But those 5--those seven hundred--those 7750 demonstrations that 570 turned into riots and property destruction and loss of life, those are not being perpetrated by white supremacists. Those are being perpetrated by people with leftist ideology, that are perpetrating the rioting and the anarchy that we simply cannot allow to continue in this country. 
And the other thing I have to point out before I turn it over to Ranking Member Peters, is even a peaceful--even peaceful protests that continue to linger day after day after day, as quite honestly happened in Kenosha where the downtown was boarded up, even if it doesn't result in direct property loss or loss of life, the fact of the matter is those types of protests can turn into sieges that deny other Americans their constitutional right of being able to operate a business or be employed in a business, or quite honestly, allow themselves to provide for themselves and their families. 
So this is a serious issue. We can't just slough it off. So many members of the mainstream media continue to just slough it off like oh these are largely peaceful protests. I'll point out the number again, almost 570 that turned into riots and to property destruction and loss of life. Those are the facts. I don't like it. But of all the threats this nation faces right now, this current one gives me the greatest cause for concern right now. 
So hopefully we can have a great discussion of all the threats, but again, I want to highlight how serious the current threats and what's happening in our streets today, what happened in Louisville last night, what a serious threat that poses and who exactly, what ideology, what side of the political spectrum are those protests springing from? Senator Peters. 
PETERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to each of our witnesses for being here today. While our committee has no shortage of serious and consequential issues to tackle, our annual threats hearing is one of the most important opportunities that we have to discuss how we can better safeguard our nation. 
We continue to face a number of security threats, both old and new. 
[*]PETERS: And over the past year since we last held a hearing, unfortunately that list has only continued to--to grow. 
Not only do we continue to face critical threats from foreign and domestic terrorism, cyber attacks, and efforts by foreign governments to sow chaos within our country, we're also dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that has tragically taken the lives of over 200,000 Americans. This public health disaster has also further expose significant security risks embedded in the tools that we use every single day to connect us with the world. 
As we have moved more of our daily lives online because of coronavirus, bad actors have exploited the technological weaknesses to attack the platforms that we use for remote school and work. Adversaries are working to infiltrate private companies and government agencies who are part of the critical race to find a vaccine. Both foreign and domestic actors have also seized on misinformation and disinformation, chipping away at the very fabric of our democracy and sowing discord and distrust in the institutions that we rely on every day to keep us safe. 
The scores of white supremacy violence is a--a long-standing issue, but is now again one of the largest terrorist threats to American safety and security. I am alarmed that this administration continues to downplay this threat and the root causes of driving these violent ideologies. We cannot be shortsighted when it comes to protecting our national security. As threats continue to develop and to evolve, our national security agencies must be willing to adapt. 
We count on DHS, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the FBI to work together and to provide a unified effort to defend the homeland. As we discussed at yesterday's hearing, I am concerned that the DHS has suffered because of a lack of qualified, consistent, and stable leadership at the agency's helm. And while I am disappointed the department does not believe the acting secretary can testify alongside his counterparts from the FBI and the National Counterism Center on these important issues during this confirmation process, I'm looking forward to testimony from all three of the officials here today. 
You know, many--many Americans will never know the names of the thousands of personnel that worked tirelessly behind the scenes at each of your agencies to keep our country safe. But we're all counting on you and your teams to address the--the known threats to our--our safety and anticipate the emerging as well as the unknown dangers our communities are going to face in the weeks, they months, years, and even decades ahead. 
I'm grateful for each of you for joining us here today. I look forward to hearing from you about the threats that America currently faces, what your departments are doing to address each of these threats, and how this committee and your agencies can continue to work together to protect our national security. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Senator Peters. And I think our witnesses will hear that repeatedly, because I think on a bipartisan basis we truly do appreciate your--your service to this nation and certainly the service and sacrifice of the men and women that work in each of your departments and agencies. 
But it is the tradition of this committee to swear and witnesses, so if you'll all stand and raise your right hand, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
WITNESSES: We do. 
JOHNSON: Thank you. Please be seated. Our first witness is the Honorable Christopher Wray. Director Wray is the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On August 2nd, 2017, Director Wray was sworn in as the eighth FBI director. He previously served as assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice for the criminal division. Director Wray? 
WRAY: Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters, members of the committee. I'm honored to be here today on behalf of the men and women of the FBI to discuss our nation's top threats from the FBI's perspective and what we're doing to counter those threats. 
I know we all share a lot of the same concerns about topics ranging from international and domestic terrorism to cybersecurity to the violence in our streets and, particularly this year, to the threat of foreign influence in our elections, just to name a few. I look forward to updating you on these and other important topics this morning. 
But I'd like to begin by covering a few items that have been particularly top of mind for us at the FBI over the past few weeks. First, terrorism remains the FBI's top priority. Though the nature of that threat has evolved significantly since 9/11, we are ever vigilant in our efforts to prevent attacks by international terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS. Those groups pose a threat not just to Americans overseas but also here at home, most notably by those we call homegrown violent extremists, often lone actors inspired by foreign terrorists, self radicalized typically online and motivated to attack soft targets with readily available weapons. 
But we're also working around the clock to prevent attacks by domestic terrorists who are inspired by one or more extremist ideologies to commit violent acts. In recent years, we've been laser focused on threats posed by racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, and they too are often radicalized online and mobilized quickly to carry out their violent plans, people like Richard Holzer, who are were Denver joint terrorism task force arrested on hate crime charges late last year while he was planning to blow up a synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. 
As with any terrorism case, we're focused on disruption, on making arrests before a criminal can act. Just this year alone, through the hard work and dedication of countless men and women both at the FBI and across our partner agencies, we've successfully thwarted terrorist attacks in Kansas City, in Tampa, Cleveland, Oklahoma City, Boston, Phoenix, and other locations. 
Now, in recent months, we've witnessed protests in various places around the country, and many members of Congress have raised a variety of questions about those protests. And--and although the majority of protesters have been peaceful, we have opened investigations on individuals involved in criminal activity of these protests, some of whom adhere to violence extremist agendas designed to sow discord and upheaval. 
Now, let me be clear. We do not investigate groups or individuals based on ideology or on the exercise of First Amendment protected activity alone. But when the ideology leads to someone to commit criminal acts and pursue violence, the FBI will not hesitate to take appropriate action. That's why we've been working closely with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure the safety of our citizens, including, I should add, the safety of all those trying to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully. 
We in law enforcement must keep our communities safe and secure while safeguarding our citizens' Constitutional rights and civil liberties. And as I've said before, one need not and must not, at the expense of the other. 
We also remain focused on other threats. In less than two months, Americans will exercise one of their most cherished rights, to vote in a free and fair election. Americans must have confidence in our voting system and our election infrastructure, and that's why the security of our elections is and will continue to be one of our highest priorities. 
We are not going to tolerate foreign interference in our elections, and we are working closely with our federal, state, and local partners as well as the private sector to share information, bolster security, and identify and disrupt any threats. Just recently, for example, we shared threat indicators with Facebook and Twitter that allowed them to take down fake accounts created as part of a Russian disinformation campaign before those accounts could develop some kind of a broader following. 
Turning to the cyber arena, we're focused on an increasingly diverse array of threats from our cyber adversaries, from state-sponsored Chinese intrusions to intrusions by Russia, Iran, North Korea, sophisticated cyber criminals seeking to exploit technical vulnerabilities, primarily for personal profit. Last week, I announce the FBI's new cyber strategy leveraging our unique expertise and authorities to impose risk and consequences on our cyber adversaries. 
We're focusing on results on impact, and that means we are working to enable our partners' operations as well as our own. So, for example, the FBI and NSA recently joined to expose a highly sophisticated Russian military intelligence malware, providing the private sector and other government partners the indicators they need to disrupt that tool. 
And just last week, our investigations enabled a coordinated mix of disruption actions against five different Iranian hacking groups, three of which worked for the Iranian government, including criminal charges by DOJ, Treasury OFAC sanctions, and CISA and FBI alerts enabling potential victims to protect themselves. 
We also face the increasingly blended threat of state-sponsored economic espionage facilitated by cyber intrusions. 
[*]In July, based on the FBI's investigative work, DOJ indicted two Chinese hackers working with the Ministry of State Security for carrying out a global computer intrusion campaign, targeting hundreds of victims, including companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology and treatments. With that kind of behavior, China continues to undercut their own claims of being a trusted and effective partner in the international community. 
Last week, we unsealed charges against five Chinese hackers who were targeting victims around the world from their safe haven in China. With our partners, we arrested two of their co-conspirators in Malaysia and seized or took down hundreds of the hackers' accounts, servers and domains. 
Now, I've touched on only a handful of the important threats we face and only lightly at that, and of course there are many significant others. As the threats evolve and scale, impact, complexity and agility, we're relying on our deep well of expertise, intelligence and partnerships. I am committed to ensuring that the bureau does great work while adhering to our core tenets of fidelity, bravery and integrity. 
In these challenging times, I remind my folks that we've got to keep calm and tackle hard, remaining faithful to our core values and best traditions while making sure that we're always doing the right thing in the right way. Thank you. I'd be happy to take your questions. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Director Wray. Our next witness is the Honorable Christopher Miller. Mr. Miller was sworn in as the seventh director of the National Counterterrorism Center in August 2020. Prior to his confirmation, he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense with special operations in combating terrorism. Mr. Miller previously served as a special assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism and transnational threats at the National Security Council. Mr. Miller served in the Army and has extensive experience with interagency and joint special operations. Mr. Miller. 
MILLER: Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters and distinguished members of the committee, it is with deep humility that I appear before you today to present my views in the state of our war against Islamist jihadist terrorist groups and other extremists that mean us harm. I represent an enormously talented and committed group that is on duty 24/7/365 to protect our citizens from terrorist attack. 
Before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to publicly thank the Department of Justice for their tireless pursuit to bring the Beatles to justice in partnership with our great friends in the United Kingdom. The Beatles were ISIS leaders involved in the brutal killing of Americans. Although our efforts can never replace their loved one, we are hopeful that the families receive some degree of closure. This is a reminder to our enemies that we never forget and will pursue justice to the ends of the earth. 
19 years ago, after the shock of Al Qaeda's devastating attacks abated, our nation set out to accomplish three objectives; one, harden our borders; two, go overseas to destroy the safe havens and sanctuaries of Al Qaeda and its associated groups and attrit their combat forces; and three, address the drivers of instability that created Al Qaeda by supporting like-minded partners in their efforts to combat Islamist extremism. 
Due to the enormous dedication, selfless service and sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans and like-minded foreign partners, we have been remarkably successful in accomplishing the first two objectives. I sense that we are on the verge, if providence is kind, of transitioning from a U.S.-led, partner-enable campaign to an era where local and regional partners take the lead and we provide them niche support to fill gaps in their security, intelligence, informational and legal architectures. 
I must be clear and not histrionic. Our enemies will successfully attack us again, as their adaptation and innovation is driven by a profound hatred for what we represent. This is our terrorists' dilemma and their strategic advantage. They only need to be successful once while our defenses must be successful all the time for preventing a cataclysmic attack. But our enemies have profoundly underestimated the resilience of the American people time and again. 
I wonder if the 9/11 Al Qaeda leaders regretted their decision to attack us. I'm confident the survivors must. They thought us soft, and spoiled and morally unanchored. They are now either dead, imprisoned or in hiding awaiting death or capture. Their ideology is debunked in the overwhelming majority of this Islamic world. No one today misjudges our resolve and commitment to protecting the security of our citizens and using all available instruments of national power against those that bring war and violence to our shores. 
However, as we have experienced in the past, the purveyors of extremism will periodically amass the resources required to attack us. My principal concern is their potential acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction. If history is an accurate guide, weapons developed are ultimately used. I do know that the American people can withstand anything they throw at us, and the use of WMD by a terrorist group would make our successful pursuit of the 9/11 attackers pale in comparison. Those that underestimate the fortitude, toughness, grit and resolve of the American public do so at their profound peril, and any such attack would guarantee their elimination. 
ISIS, which originally formed as Al Qaeda in Iraq, is in crisis. Its (INAUDIBLE) caliphate is destroyed, and its ideology is exposed as a brutal, perverse and horrifying abomination. The world recognizes that a positive and magnificent faith was hijacked by a handful of corrupt, selfish opportunists. ISIS's territorial defeat in Syria and Iraq has forced the group to return to its insurgent roots and increased its reliance on its global branches and networks to project a narrative of strength. With superb partners from the 86-member coalition that defeated ISIS in the Middle East, we continue our efforts to render ISIS permanently impotent. 
Even as we continue to combat these traditional enemies, we face new ones, including increasingly aggressive groups aligned with Iran and domestic violent extremists, motivated by a variety of ideologies. I am hopeful that in the coming year or two we will be successful in destroying the remnants of Al Qaeda's leadership and continue the attrition of ISIS, guaranteeing that this does not become a multigenerational war. 
For the past 19 years, I've been involved in this struggle at all levels, from the moonscape of southern Afghanistan in 2001, to Baghdad in 2003, to senior policy and strategic leadership in Washington, DC and internationally as a CT strategist, advisor and policymaker. The only sacrosanct lesson I have learned is that we must maintain pressure on these groups to preclude them from establishing safe haven where they can rest, train, plot and project combat forces. 
We must continue to be chastened by our relaxing of this constant pressure in 2011, which allowed for the creation of the largest, most successful terrorist insurgency in modern history in Iraq and Syria. It's a testament to the sacrifice of a generation that we are now at a place where terrorism isn't the primary national security priority, but rather another issue of concern. But we must not overcorrect or disinvest before we solidify our gains and make them enduring. This war has been long. Many are tired. We face new crises and challenges. We have sacrificed greatly. But as wars near their end, victory requires continued commitment and focus. This is what we owe the next generations, that we saw it through and we ended it on our terms. 
I thank you for this body's uncompromising support and partnership. I rest easier knowing that your support will continue as we maintain pressure on Al Qaeda and ISIS in these final battles. I look forward to your questions. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Director Miller. Our final witness is the Honorable Ken Cuccinelli. Mr. Cuccinelli is the senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. He previously served as the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and also served as the attorney general of the Commonwealth of Virginia where he led the state's fight against human trafficking. Mr. Cuccinelli. 
CUCCINELLI: Good morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I'm here to discuss the myriad of threats facing the American people and our homeland. In 2020, the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security have carried out their protective mission with-- 
[*]CUCCINELLI: --professional excellence as our nation faces unprecedented and dynamic challenges. From the pandemic to riots to natural disasters, the Trump administration has ensured that our personnel have the vital support and the resources they need to address evolving threats while continuing to fulfil our enduring no-fail missions. 
DHS has a clear mandate from President Trump. At all times, in all decisions, in all dangers, to keep the safety and prosperity of the American people as our first priority. 
Today, I'll briefly comment on three national threats that deserve specific attention: the civil unrest, domestic terrorism, and transnational criminal organizations. When we talk about domestic terrorism, we're talking about threats or acts of violence carried out against people or critical infrastructure in the U.S. to advance an ideological agenda or coerce policy or social change. 
These are generally conducted by Americans and not linked to foreign terrorist organizations. Americans have the right to believe whatever they want, but there is no right to carry out acts of violence to further those beliefs. That is when we move from protected speech to domestic terrorism. 
When the civil unrest by violent anarchists dragged on for months in Portland, Oregon and local leadership refused to cooperate with federal law enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security defended the federal courthouse without hesitation, in partnership with the U.S. marshals there. Despite being pelted with IEDs, Molotov cocktails, fireworks, metal pipes, hammers, and more, our federal officers were resolute, sustaining more than 340 injuries in the course of their duties. 
Lawlessness has festered in too many of our communities, from Chicago to Seattle, Minneapolis to New York, even Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Kenosha, Wisconsin. The department will always uphold the right to peacefully protest, but there is no constitutional right to loot, to burn, or to assault others. President Trump has made it clear that we cannot and will not allow acts of violence, intimidation, or chaos to prevail in American streets and the Department of Homeland Security is proud to participate in implementing such policies. 
On the transnational criminal organization front, TCOs as we frequently call them, and beyond illegal immigration at our borders, we're also contending with the most deadly organizations in the Western Hemisphere: the Mexican drug cartels. To put it in context, the power of these transnational criminal organizations is so great that it is a destabilizing force to many governments in our hemisphere. Their attempts at drug smuggling and human trafficking, not to mention their regular, brutal, and violent tactics, must be addressed. 
Last year in America, we lost 71,000 Americans to drug overdoses. They happened in every one of your states and every one of your communities, and I know all of you are familiar and touched by those tragedies--familiar with and touched by those tragedies. 
Consistently, the majority of these deadly drugs and opioids are produced and smuggled by criminal organizations across our southern border. Working daily to decrease the flow of illegal drugs, DHS has seized 4 million pounds of hard drugs. It's worth noting that we're on track to seize drugs at roughly twice the rate of the previous eight years. 
So, in these four years, we've seized about as many drugs as had been seized in the previous eight of the hard drugs. We're talking about fentanyl, meth, those--that level of--of drug seizures. 
Transnational criminal organizations and their allies are not content profiting off the destruction of lives through the drug trade. They're also destroying lives through human trafficking. 
The brand new 330 miles of border wall and high impact sectors pushes human traffickers and drug smugglers to locations where we're best equipped to catch them: ports of entry. It makes their transnational efforts much harder and makes America safer. That is another reason why this administration's delivery on the promise to build that wall and the system that goes with it so very important. 
Finally, while I addressed election security at length in my written testimony, I do want to reiterate that our goal at DHS, our fundamental goal, is to ensure that American voters decide American elections. As we sit here in September of 2020, it seems an important point worth reiterating. 
Finally, we do need legislative help from Congress in at least two areas. There are many we work together in, but there are two I would like to highlight. We need greater authority or some authority to designate transnational organized crime at a level below a foreign terrorist organization, but giving us authorities above the level of mere criminal law. We will not prosecute our way out of the TCO problem. 
And, we also need the authority to address the drone threat in an appropriate manner. We can't study the problem forever. We do have some authorities provided by Congress, but we need to be able to bring them down and have the--the money, the appropriations, to purchase the equipment to allow us to do that. This problem is well studied. The danger is understood and we are, frankly, behind the curve in being equipped to address it, I would note especially in my view at airports, the borders, and sensitive sites. 
The threats facing our homeland are vast and varied, but I can promise you the men and women of DHS are committed to rise and face the evolving threats of tomorrow, embracing their duty to safeguard the American people. And, thank you. I'm now happy to answer your questions. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Cuccinelli. Unfortunately, Democrat Leader Schumer is obstructing the workings of the Senate and so we are bound by some Archaean Senate rule that because of his lack of consent, his obstruction, our hearing has to have a hard stop two hours after the convening the Senate for Business. So, again, unfortunately, we're going to have to--I'm going to have to limit the amount of time of questioning to five minute rounds to make sure that every Senator gets a chance to ask a question and I will keep people closely to that five minutes. 
So, you'll hear me interject if you're running over five minutes and I'll also ask the witnesses to be looking at their clocks as well and--and not ramble on past the five minute time. I--I want to make sure every member gets a chance to ask questions. 
But, for the time being, I'll defer my questioning, but I will for sure get it in, even if that means a member doesn't get to ask questions toward the tail end of the hearing. But, we'll--I'll defer to Senator Peters right now. 
PETERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you to each of our witnesses for being here today. Director Wray, I'm going to start with you and talk about election integrity, which you raised in your opening comments. It's important for us to put this all in perspective that we know people are actually voting today in states all across the country. In fact, in Michigan, today is the day that you can go to your clerk and vote and we're going to have well over 2 million ballots are being mailed out starting today for absentee voters. 
You said last week at the House hearing that ""the steady drumbeat of information"" is your number one concern for the election. You noted that the threat can lead to--to, ""a lack of confidence in the American voters and citizens and the validity of their vote."" 
So, given the--the COVID-19 pandemic, we're seeing many more people vote by mail. As I mentioned, unprecedented numbers of absentee ballots have been asked for in the state of Michigan. So, I wanted to spell this--some of this drumbeat of misinformation that we're hearing out there. 
And, so my question is very direct. Is voting by mail secure? 
WRAY: Well, senator, I think what I would say is this. We take all election related threats seriously, whether it's voter fraud, voter suppression, whether it's in person, whether it's by mail, and our role is to investigate the threat actors. 
Now, we have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or--or otherwise. We have seen voter fraud at the local level from time to time and so my comment should, in no way, be construed as minimizing how seriously we take our responsibility to investigate such incidents or the potential impact those things could have at the local level. So, it's in our radar. 
Certainly to change a--a federal election outcome by mounting that kind of fraud at scale would be a major challenge for an adversary, but people should make no mistake, we're vigilant as to the threat and watching it carefully because we're in-- 
[*]WRAY: --Charted new territory. 
And I think as far as risk assessments of any particular state's processes or systems, I would defer to--to Mr. Cuccinelli and--and DHS CISA, because that's really more in their lane. 
PETERS: Right. But your--your answer is clear. You've not seen any widespread fraud by mail, and it's something the FBI watches continuously to make sure that that's not happening. So, folks-- 
WRAY: --That's something we investigate seriously-- 
PETERS: --Absolutely-- 
WRAY: --Aggressively. 
PETERS: So, the--the--the next question is, you know, effective interagency coordination is obviously going to be very important. You miss--mentioned Mr. Cuccinelli with DHS, as we're all on this to make sure that our votes are counted and it's fair and free election. So, the question is what--what does that interagency cooperation look like and, more specifically, who's--who's in charge? Of all of you that are involved in election security, who is actually in charge? Is it the White House? Is it the FBI? Is it CYBERCOM? Is it another entity? Who should we look to as being in charge? 
WRAY: So, I'll--I'll start and then maybe Mr. Cuccinelli would want to chime in as well. We all work together. We all have lead in different aspects of the problem. We have command posts where we're all--we have people from each other's agencies stationed on that to ensure that the glue, the connective tissue, is there. 
As far as foreign influence, malign foreign influence here domestically, investigating that is the FBI's lead, and as well as investigating cyber intrusions into election infrastructure. But DHS takes the lead in terms of protecting infrastructure and--and mitigation in response to that. You mentioned CYBERCOM. Obviously, to the extent that there is offense of cyber, we're-- 
PETERS: --So, there's not one entity necessarily in charge. You would just take your--you--you have your different lanes to run in. You cooperate. But there's not one person that's going to be called in charge. 
WRAY: As is true, frankly, with counterterrorism. 
PETERS: Okay. 
WRAY: Right, we all work together. 
PETERS: Well, in the-- 
WRAY: --We're all lead on different parts and we work together. 
PETERS: I appreciate it. In the limited time I have, Director Wray, just a final question because you've mentioned foreign government influence in the election and misinformation. Give us some advice. How--how can American voters recognize an attempt by a foreign government to influence their opinion and vote? It's important. I know behind the scenes you're working. We've got all the different agencies that are working. But how do we let the American voter know this is basically a disinformation campaign that's perpetrated by a foreign government? How should they recognize that? 
WRAY: Well, I think it's a challenge, as you--as your question alludes to. I would say when it comes to information about their vote itself, where to vote, when to vote, hours of the polling places, information about the results, things like that, it's very important that Americans get that information from their official state or local election website as opposed to relying on something that might be in social media, for example. 
As far as getting their news which might shift or influence their views more broadly, I would encourage people to be critical thinkers and to get their news from a variety of sources and make up their own mind and be a skeptical, discerning electorate, which is what I think is the best defense against malign foreign influence and disinformation. 
PETERS: Well, I'm out of time. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Senator Lankford? 
LANKFORD: Gentlemen, thank you very much for the work, and please thank the folks that work around you that we don't get a chance to meet in this pleasant setting when we get a chance to gather every time together. Tell them thank you because they do a lot of work behind the scenes. 
Director Wray, I want--I want to be able to ask you about some of the violence that's happened across the country in the past several months. We've had hundreds and hundreds of peaceful protests on racial injustice around the country, that we are grateful as a country we have the option to be able to have peaceful protests and people are allowed to be able to speak out and point issues out. 
But some of them have turned a very violent. And in some of your testimony in the House, it seemed that you were trending to try to connect some groups. Have you been able to identify groups or entities behind the scenes that seem to be organizing it nationally to be--to foam--foment violence in some of these events, or are you seeing these as a spontaneous events or small groups that are unconnected with others? 
WRAY: So, senator, I appreciate the question and I appreciate the opportunity to try to be as clear as I can, because this is an important topic. I think the first thing big picture is that, as the chairman referenced in his opening comments, when you look across the country, you've got three broad categories. You've got the peaceful protesters. That's maybe the biggest number of people. Then you got sort of a second category, which is what I would describe as criminal opportunists engaged in looting, low-level vandalism, etc. 
But then you've got a third group, and while it might numerically be the smallest, it's by far and away the most dangerous, the most serious, and the one that we have to go after the most aggressively, which is the people who are clearly violating federal law, you know, IEDs, Molotov cocktails, specific targeting of law enforcement, arsons of government facilities and businesses, etc. Who those people are, that's our priority, that's our focus, varies, their motivation and what drives them from day-to-day, city to city. 
However, we have certainly seen a--a number of violent anarchist extremists participating in that--in that mix. I've got a lot of questions from a lot of people about Antifa, for example, so let me try to be as clear as I can about that. Antifa is a real thing. It is not a fiction. Now, we have seen organized, tactical activity at both the local and regional level. We have seen Antifa adherence coalescing and working together in what I would describe as a small groups and nodes. All of this I said last week, but some of it got more clearly conveyed than others. 
We have a number of predicated investigations into some anarchist violent extremists who operate--some of whom operate through these nodes and subscribe to or self identify with anarchist extremism including Antifa. And we will not hesitate, will not hesitate to aggressively investigate that kind of activity. 
So, we're going to be looking at and we have been looking at their funding, their tactics, the logistics, their supply chains. And we're going to pursue all available charges. There also--in addition to that group, there are what I would describe as more militia types, and we've had plenty of those and we've got a number of investigations into those as well. 
But I think trying to put a lot of these things into nice, neat, clean buckets is a--a bit of a challenge, because one of the things that we see more and more in the counterterrorism spaces people who assemble together in some kind of mishmash, a bunch of different ideologies. All--we sometimes refer to it as almost like a salad bar of ideologies, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and what they're really about is the violence. And we are not going to stand for the violence. 
LANKFORD: Nor should you. And the American people are grateful for that, that we're engaging. Peaceful protest is encouraged and allowed in our country. Violence is not on that. 
You and I have spoken several times about Oklahoma specific issues and the McGirt decision from the Supreme Court last year and the significant change that is for the FBI in Oklahoma. We are grateful for your engagement, and I'd continue to be able to ask for your engagement for law enforcement they are in Oklahoma as we deal with the dynamics of that decision and what that means for us. And we're grateful for that. 
Director Miller, before we run out of time, and I've only got a few seconds and I apologize for that, and it's the--the issue of China. Director O'Brien has made the comment that there is a rise in China trying to be able to engage in our election this year, and he identified that as one of our greatest threats. Can you briefly comment on that and what you're seeing right now? Is it just influence or is it in actual cyber attacks on our system? 
MILLER: Thanks, Senator. I--I'm just--I look at international terrorism specifically, not really familiar with the--the-- 
LANKFORD: --Okay-- 
MILLER: --The question. 
LANKFORD: Could anyone else comment on that briefly? 
CUCCINELLI: Sure. Briefly, you know, each of the two areas you mentioned, China is a major threat. They're a rising power, and they have every intention of trying to rival and surpass us as a nation. And they have stolen our intellectual property at a level--Director Wray said last week in a phrase I thought was very applicable, the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world is the Chinese stealing intellectual property from Americans, and for purposes--for their strategic purposes, military intelligence and their economy. 
We also face them trying to exercise influence via money and are there media enterprises much more overtly than other countries are even able to. And last an absolutely not least, in this country is there massive trade with us, which can be a positive, of course, for both sides, is also used as a lever of influence. 
LANKFORD: Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Senator Lankford, we were just informed that Senator Schumer did not invoke the rule today so we do not have a hard stop. You have another minute, 15 seconds if you'd like to do that. And Senator Peters, if you want to tack on another two minutes now or we can do that later. But you can continue your questioning for another minute-- 
LANKFORD: --Thank you. I--I-- 
JOHNSON: --15 seconds. And we'll have seven minute rounds. 
LANKFORD: Great. Thank you. I appreciate that. Let me do my last minute, 15 seconds here. I do want to drill down on this issue about China and trying to--malign influence for the election in particular. 
When Director O'Brien made that comment, obviously we're dealing with Russia and what they did--did in 2016. We're all very aware of how they were trying to engage in our election, but his comments seem to be that China is being even more aggressive behind the scenes this time than--than Russia was. We also know that Iran is trying to be able to influence our elections; didn't know if there's any clarity that any of you could bring to that. 
[*]LANKFORD: Obviously he's not sitting at the table today, but if there are any other comments about that. 
CUCCINELLI: I would just note that the way China acts in that arena is different than Russia and Iran, in part because they have so many more levers. Iran and Russia don't have the trade with us that China has. They don't have the relationships at every level of government that China has. And they don't have the connections to our economy and so forth. So they don't have the levers that China has available to them. We've seen through this year COVID was an excellent example as we roll into the election season where they are--they've got ambassadors in other countries. They've got their foreign minister. They're taking on false narratives aimed at the United States very overtly and then spreading them through their media outlets in ways that our other opponents don't have available to them. So it's a very unique attack. 
LANKFORD: Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Senator Peters, would you like to take your two minutes now? Just so everybody knows, I'm in quarantine, so I won't be voting. We have the 11:30 vote, so I will definitely defer my question to the very end, but Senator Peters, do you want to go, or should we go to Senator Hassan? 
PETERS: Yeah, if I could, I'll just take a quick two minutes. It will be a quick question to continue with Director Wray. Director Wray, online extremist conspiracy theories kind of have jumped out of obscure web forms, and unfortunately now are prominently featured on traditional social media, and even more concerning, they are manifesting themselves in real-world incidents of violence. So my question to you, Mr. Wray, is there a risk that foreign actors will try to leverage some Americans' belief in some of these conspiracy theories that are floating around quite widely, and will they use that to engineer some violent confrontations? How concerned should we be about that? 
WRAY: Well, certainly we are--there are sort of two strands that you're alluding to there that we're concerned about. One is the sheer impact of social media on the threats that we face, right? I mean, so in the terrorism context, we say that terrorism today moves at the speed of social media, and that's really across all the different terrorist threats. Then separately you have this effect also facilitated by social media where foreign adversaries will identify trends, divisive issues, in some cases conspiracy theories, that they will then, in effect, piggyback on and amplify and push to suit their own policy goals and propaganda. 
And we see that across a range of adversaries. Russia, of course, but also China, also Iran. And so it's a real concern. And whether or not the second trend will ultimately manifest itself in terms of violence, hard to say, but certainly there is an effort to sow upheaval and discord. And as we've seen around the country, discord and upheaval can lead to dangerous, violent criminal activity that we'll have to go after very aggressively. 
PETERS: And this is something the FBI is very focused on I would hope? 
WRAY: Yes. 
PETERS: Good. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Senator Hassan. 
HASSAN: Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking Member Peters, for this hearing. Thank you to our witnesses for being here today, and please thank all the women and men with whom you serve for their excellent work keeping us safe. This hearing is about threats to the homeland. Before we begin, we must acknowledge a new and dangerous threat to our country and our constitution, the president of the United States' refusal to promise a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election. 
Today I call on every person who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution, including my fellow senators, to condemn the president's remarks and to recommit to ensuring a peaceful transfer of power, whatever the outcome of this election. Some of the members of this committee from both parties have already done so, and I appreciate their words. I hope that the rest of the committee will speak out, as well. 
Now to Director Wray, at last year's threats to the homeland hearing we discussed the growing threat of ransomware attacks to our communities. Over the past six months there has been a further uptick in ransomware attacks on hospitals and schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Just this month a ransomware attack on a German hospital led to the death of a patient, and there has been a spate of ransomware attacks on our schools as districts have migrated to online learning. 
Our communities do not have the resources to effectively counter a wide range of cyber threats on their own, including ransomware. So Director Wray, I appreciated in your opening comments your discussion of cyber threats. Could you drill down a bit more on what the FBI is doing to help protect state and local governments and other nonfederal partners from ongoing cyberattacks and to deter malicious cyber adversaries? 
WRAY: So senator, I appreciate the question, and I do recall our exchange from last year. Certainly, ransomware is a particularly concerning part of the cyber threat that we face, and the threat of ransomware against state and local governments is particularly high. There are a variety of reasons why ransomware actors target municipalities, hospitals, police forces, etc. 
We--one of the things that we've done recently is through our national cyber investigative joint task force. We have brought together a whole of government effort to focus across multiple agencies, intelligence community and law enforcement, on the most damaging ransomware variants, and some of that is through investigative activity, disruptions, some of that is through outreach and engagement where we work very closely with CISA at DHS to help educate those entities on how to better harden and protect their infrastructure because certainly having good cyber hygiene backups, etc., is one of the best defenses against ransomware. 
We are seeing what is something that concerns me in particular, a growing trend to see ransomware actors essentially sharing ransomware across different organized criminal activity. So that basically means that some of the most sophisticated forms of ransomware are now potentially available to less sophisticated actors. This is sort of a version of cybercrime as a service, which is deeply troubling and just increases the risk. 
We're also seeing a greater trend of ransomware actors essentially piecemeal pushing out the information. In other words, rather than just locking it up and encrypting it and holding it ransom, they are essentially releasing little bits of time into the public domain as a way of increasing their leverage. 
HASSAN: The pressure, right. Well thank you. I appreciate that very much and I look forward to continuing to work with you on that. Director Wray, I also wanted to touch on another issue. I was pleased to see Tuesday's announcement about Operation DisrupTor, an effort to stop drug trafficking on the dark web. This operation resulted in the seizure of hundreds of kilograms of illicit drugs, including fentanyl and dozens of firearms, as well as the arrest of 179 people. 
Needless to say, this was a significant operation. I appreciate the work of all of the federal agents who carried it out. Last week I wrote a letter to you and the attorney general asking for more information about efforts to combat drug trafficking on the dark web. Senators Cornyn and Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee joined the letter, as well. We requested a reply by October 15. Can you commit to a written response by that date, which is still three weeks away? 
WRAY: Well, I certainly will get you a response as promptly as possible. Not having had the chance to read the letter yet, I don't know how involved a response would mean, but certainly we appreciate your focus on the issue, and J-CODE, which is the essentially the operation that we've stood up that spins off these things like Operation DisrupTor, is a, I think a really exciting, effective tool, a coordinated interagency tool--it's not just the FBI--to disrupt and dismantle dark net marketplaces, which is really a particularly important part of the opioid problem that we're all facing. 
HASSAN: Absolutely. So I thank you. And I would look forward to further conversation about what additional resources Congress could provide to help bolster those efforts, but I'm going to move on to one last question now, if that's all right. To Director Miller and Director Wray, last December, a member of the Saudi military in the United States on a training mission killed three people and injured eight at a Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate claimed credit for the attack, marking the terrorist group's first successful attack in the United States in several years. Director Miller and Director Wray, do you feel confident with the adequacy of screening done by the U.S. on foreign military trainees entering our country, and how would you assess the vulnerabilities of this exchange program? Start with you, Director Miller. 
MILLER: Thank you, Senator. Obviously of great concern, and thanks for the question. Adaptive, innovative enemy that means us great harm. They found a loophole. The loophole has been closed. I'm confident now in the Department of Defense's efforts to recognized that how the security protocols and screening need to work, but they found a loophole, and they exploited it. 
HASSAN: Thank you. And Director Wray? 
WRAY: I do think that the Department of Defense has taken important strides to address the vulnerability that was there. Of course, there's also an important role for the Saudi government to play. 
[*]WRAY: And they've been cooperative at different times on this issue, but they're an incredibly important partner if we're going to be able to prevent something like what happened at Pensacola again. 
HASSAN: Well, thank you, and I appreciate all of your work very much. Lastly, Director Miller, as a New Hampshire senator, I thank you for everything that you have done to bring the killers of James Foley to justice. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Senator Romney. 
ROMNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and--and thank you for each of the panelists for the work that you do. Deeply appreciate the work of the men and women who work in your respective organizations, that are working every day to keep us safe. 
Director Wray, with regards to--to foreign cyber threats and--and theft, I think we can agree that the best defense is a good offense. China, Iran, Russia are only going to stop attacking our cyber--in a cyber way if they're hurt more than--than we are. And, I guess the question is, do you believe that our offensive cyber efforts are as effective as they should be? And, if not, what should we be adding? 
WRAY: So, certainly I agree with you that an important part of fighting back against our foreign adversaries in the cyber realm is offense, as well as defense. That's a big part of this new strategy, FBI strategy that I rolled out, which is the idea--as I sort of maybe obliquely referenced in my opening statement--about focusing on results and maximizing impact. 
Sometimes, the way to maximize impact is through law enforcement action that we would take. Sometimes, it's through sanctions. But, sometimes it's through offensive cyber operations and we are very focused on making sure that intelligence and information that we develop through our investigative work is shared with our partners to enable their operations offensively. 
And, so through our--our national cyber investigative joint taskforce, we're much more effective in partnering with the relevant IC and DOD agencies on that. I think there's--obviously, it's a growing area and we're getting more sophisticated all the time and you will never find an FBI director that wouldn't welcome more tools. But, I do think we're moving in the right direction and I think you're right to raise the issue. 
ROMNEY: Thank you, sir. Director Miller, I appreciate your--your clear eyed unvarnished update on where we are. With regards to weapons of mass destruction, do other nation states recognize just how severe a--a threat it would be for a weapon of mass destruction to fall in the hands of a non-state actor and to be used against us or anyone else for that matter? Do they recognize that and--and are they taking sufficient actions to secure their nuclear capabilities? 
MILLER: Thanks, senator, for that question. I can say definitively with our partners that they take it seriously. I can't dispute the fact that some rogue regime might not find gain or strategic value in providing such--such weapons. Obviously, if something--if a nation state was so unsophisticated to do something like that, I feel strongly that it would probably result in just catastrophic effects on them. 
It's--what we're seeing really is they recognize--our terrorist enemies recognize that that is the one thing they haven't been able to use against us. We have targeted again and again and will continue to prioritize any terrorist groups that are trying to acquire those types of weapon systems. 
ROMNEY: Thank you. And, Director Wray and--and Mr. Cuccinelli, I think we have watched with dismay as what have begun as peaceful protests turned violent, where heavily masked, apparently organized individuals come in and--and do destruction and in some cases, cause death. 
It seems, in many respects, that we're not as effective as we would like to be in preventing or stopping people of that nature. Sometimes, we wonder, well do we need more police on the frontlines? Do we need National Guard? Do we need heavier equipment? Other times, it's like, no, no, that will only encourage violence to--to occur. 
I guess the question is this. Given--given your experience so far, what--what are we doing wrong? What--what should we be doing better to prevent what began as peaceful protests from being, if you will, kidnapped by these small groups of, whether it's Antifa or--or other violent groups of anarchists? How can we shut them down as violence begins to occur in a way that we're not doing now? 
CUCCINELLI: You want to go first? 
WRAY: Well, I'll start and then turn it over to Mr. Cuccinelli. I think at a big picture level, what you--if you look across the country, the places that have been most effective in countering the kind of violence and dangerous criminal activity that you're describing and preventing those bad actors from hijacking otherwise peaceful protests has been quick, prompt, robust partnership between federal, state, and local law enforcement. 
And, where all the partners have really worked together quickly, all on the same page, all with the same mission, all aligned, it's usually been nipped in the bud, which has allowed both peaceful protests to continue, but has also prevented dangerous violence from--from really fermenting and spreading. 
CUCCINELLI: You know, senator, I would add that first of all, I would double down on the Director's comment about the necessity of state, local, and federal cooperation. Where you see ready, smooth cooperation at the professional level--we're not talking about, you know, mayors and city councils. We're talking about when they don't interfere with their police's ability to interact with those of us at DOJ and DHS. That's where you see success. 
And, I would say in terms of tactics, it's a peace through strength approach. It isn't that we want to engage in the battles. It's that we want to deter them and allow the peaceful protesting to go on peacefully. And, the way that has succeeded around the country over the last several months is where there is sufficient responsible law enforcement in place, violence is deterred and peaceful protesting can continue. 
I would just note, this is overwhelmingly--or largely in the hands of state and local authorities. We have limitations on our federal jurisdictional authority, more so at DHS than DOJ, but we all respect our legal boundaries of authority. And, that leads many people sometimes to be frustrated about why we might not be doing more in city X. 
We'll take Portland. We have federal facilities that we were addressing and protecting and the people there, but it is--there is no jurisdiction on the part of Homeland Security to police Portland in the way their police do, even though their police won't cooperate frequently with our officers, and the result is greater violence. 
ROMNEY: Thank you. 
UNKNOWN: Thank you for your (INAUDIBLE)-- 
JOHNSON: Mr. Cuccinelli, just real quick. You sent me a video of a press conference with, I think, the police--the chief of police of Chicago. Pretty disturbing video. If you can just quick describe that, I think this would be a good time to have you do that. 
CUCCINELLI: So, the video the chairman is referring to is the July 20th press conference by Superintendent Brown, who is the police chief in Chicago. And, you'll recall when he had 49 officers injured during what amounted to an attack on a Christopher Columbus statue in that city. And, that press conference, the first 14 minutes is, in my view, the most clear and simple description, and he shows it to you. He just doesn't tell you. 
He shows you the video footage of the transformation of what clearly starts out as what looks like any other peaceful protest in any other city, literally marching down the street, police protection in front and back to keep--you know, take care of traffic. And, then it makes a left turn into the park and they use drone footage. They show you people changing into the black block anonymous clothing. They show you people dropping bags' worth of weapons to be used against the police. They show you the transformation of the PVC pipes used to hold the banner to--and pulling those apart and then using those as weapons, the use of umbrellas. 
And, it's--it is truly one of the clearest examples and best explained that I have seen anywhere since these--these protests turned violent have happened this summer. It's the July 20th press conference by Superintendent Brown of Chicago and I would urge anyone interested in this subject to pull it up on YouTube and watch it. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Cuccinelli. It certainly shows that in this case, it wasn't spontaneous violence. This was well organized, well planned-- 
CUCCINELLI: --Really planned ahead, yes.-- 
JOHNSON: --pre-planned and it was--it was violent. Senator Rosen? 
ROSEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the ranking member. And thank you for--all of you for being here today, for the important work that you and your teams do and the analysis that you are all engaging in. 
Earlier this month, we know Americans learned from drafts of the 2020 DHS threat assessment that white supremacists present the greatest terror threat to our nation. The earliest draft refers to white supremacist extremists, and I quote, ""presenting the most lethal threat,"" whereas later drafts of the report softened the language on the white supremacist threat. 
Mr. Cuccinelli, I was alarmed to see a whistleblower complaint from Brian Murphy (SP) at DHS alleging that you personally ordered him to ""modify the section on white supremacy in a manner that made the threat appear less severe to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump,"" and I ended that quote. Mr. Cuccinelli, do you agree with FBI Director Wray that the top threat we face from domestic violent extremes stem from racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists? 
CUCCINELLI: I certainly think that the lethality analysis that you cited is correct. It's been this--it's been the position of the Department of Homeland Security for some time. It has not been changed, despite the implications of your question. And I continue to believe-- 
ROSEN: --So, why the change-- 
CUCCINELLI: --That that is true. And it isn't a belief. It's just looking at the data. The--when white supremacists act as terrorists, more people per incident are killed. That is a higher lethality. That's what we're referring to. 
ROSEN: So, then why the change between the earlier and most recent drafts to soften the language, if you believe that that's true? 
CUCCINELLI: We have not softened is the language. And you'll see, when the final report is out, that the--what you're describing is still in our homeland threat assessment. So, that--that--your--your concerns in that regard I can put to rest. 
ROSEN: Well, why did you order Mr. Murphy then to downplay the threat of (INAUDIBLE)? 
CUCCINELLI: Oh, I absolutely did not do that. That did not happen. 
ROSEN: So, you don't have the metrics that you personally used to assess the intelligence prod--products. Would you provide those, that you would say that they're good or bad, how you assess the threats and to be sure that we are not downplaying inputs? 
CUCCINELLI: Well, the--the--the metric used with respect to the subject you and I were just talking about is the number of deaths. It's a ratio, deaths per incident. And because that ratio is highest among domestic violent extremists among white supremacist terrorists as opposed to the other types that we face, that leads to the conclusion mathematically that they have the highest lethality-- 
ROSEN: --Okay-- 
CUCCINELLI: --At least in recent years. 
ROSEN: Well, I look forward to working with you and your team on trying to down--work on stopping those threats and eliminate those threats and keep our community safer, but I do have another question for you while I have you here. 
I am disturbed, I guess that's mild way to put it, disturbed by the allegations we've all heard about forced hysterectomies taking place at an ICE facility in Georgia. These are assaults on women's bodies, and there must be accountability. Have you gone down to visit the facility in Georgia? And if so, who was with you? 
CUCCINELLI: Senator, I agree with you that those would be--those are shocking allegations. And as a result, I immediately dispatched a team from outside of ICE, including a doctor from the Coast Guard, an attorney, and one member of my staff, who is a retired Army nurse as well to review the records in that facility. 
And I'm happy to report that at this stage--the inspector general is still doing a more in-depth review, but at this stage the documentation indicates that there were, over the course of four years, two hysterectomies performed on two women. And that is confirmed by the nearby medical facility where those procedures take place. They came to the same numerical conclusion that--that we did. But as I said, the inspector general's continuing to investigate that. 
And I should also add that one of the lawyers-- 
ROSEN: --Did you go down-- 
CUCCINELLI: --That filed the complaint last Friday was reported by the AP as indicating that they haven't actually talked to anyone who had a hysterectomy, but that they wanted the department to investigate the subject, which is not, of course, a legitimate basis to bring a complaint. But that was learned after the fact. 
ROSEN: Thank you. I appreciate that. But you didn't answer the question. Did you go down to Georgia yourself with that team, sir? 
CUCCINELLI: No, I didn't go with that team. I dispatched that seem to go literally within a day or two of the allegation. 
ROSEN: So, you weren't--you haven't been there as--for yourself. That's all I'm asking. 
CUCCINELLI: I have not been to that facility. 
ROSEN: Thank you. 
I'd like to move on to Director Miller and talk a little bit about Iran quickly and the time we have left. In your testimony, you noted that Iran has the ability to employ and support terrorism within the United States. You also stated that Hezbollah has extended its reach into the United States in recent years. 
For instance as recently as 2018, two Iranians were arrested in the U.S. for surveilling Iranian activists and Jewish groups and passing the information back to Iran. So, can you please outline for us the threat to the homeland from Iran and its terrorist proxy, Hezbollah? 
MILLER: Yes. Thank you, senator, for the great question and of great concern. As we all know, Iran is the greatest state sponsor of terror in the world and continues to plot against America all the time, as though almost if it's part--it is part of their strategic calculus, and greatly concerned by their continued ambition as well is aggressiveness. 
And it's--it's something that, of course, all three of us at this table look at probably several times a day. And our men and women are on point on this, but absolutely of concern. And--and--but at this point, you know, a lot of times the Iranian bark is--is louder than the bite, and we went to keep it that way. But it's still obviously one of our principal threats. 
ROSEN: Well, thank you. I look forward to working with you to find out what Congress can do to improve interagency collaboration to keep Iran's bark worse than its bite, particularly when it comes to homeland threats. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Senator Rosen. Senator Scott? 
SCOTT: Thank you, Chairman Johnson, for hosting this today. I want to thank each of our witnesses here today for what you do. I want to particularly thank Director Wray for his efforts after Parkland. 
And I had a great trip to--I guess it's called the TIP Center, and it's a wonderful group of people that are working hard to make sure, with a lot of--a lot of tips, you know, how to--how to figure out how to make sure stuff--you know, things get directed down to the right person. And that I also want to thank Director Wray for his efforts after the Pensacola shooting to keep us informed and trying to figure out how we make sure something like that doesn't happen again. If so, I want to thank all the--the individuals that work at the FBI for their hard work. 
The--it's really--it's disgusting what's been going on with our law enforcement, how law enforcement's been treated. And, you know, the insults they're taking, the--the things that are thrown at them, and it's just--it's disgusting. Reminds me of what happened to people that were coming back from Vietnam, and they were--they were treated disgustingly. And they're not the ones who chose to go. They chose to defend the freedom of this country. And they followed the--the orders that they--they were--they were given. 
So, last week, I did a resolution on the Senate floor supporting the men and women of law enforcement. And it shocked me, but members of the--the Democrat party decided to block it. And--and I just can't imagine that just a simple resolution to support the members of law enforcement wanted to get supported by everybody in this--in this country, especially in the U.S. Senate. 
What are--what are y'all doing to--or what is--how does it impact the morale of the people in law enforcement when you see how badly law enforcement's treated, and what are y'all doing to make sure that the members of law enforcement that you work with and others are--are--are safe? 
WRAY: So, I--senator, I appreciate both your comments about the FBI and even more, in some ways, your concern about the men and women of law enforcement around this country. I--I will say that this is personal for me and personal for us at the FBI. All of the state and local law enforcement departments that we're talking about have members on her task forces, and we work with them every day. 
And I will tell you that the rate of violence, including lethal--felonious lethal violence against law enforcement is up significantly this year from last year. And when I say is personal, I mean that in--in a different sense as well, which is one of the things I started doing when I became director was that I was going to call--I decided I was going to call every time an officer was killed in the line of duty--shot and killed or killed by an adversary, I was going to call the chief or sheriff myself. 
My staff gives me a picture of the--the dead officer, a description of his family, and we--I call the--the chief or the sheriff and we have a conversation and I express my condolences. 
[*]WRAY: I will tell you that I've had to make way too many of those calls. And in fact, in late August, early September of this year, in about on 15--day period I had to make seven of those calls, so that's basically one every other day. Each one of those officers was a son or a daughter, or a mother or father, beloved family members, community members. And all they do is get out and try to serve the public. And sometimes I scratch my head why more people can't appreciate how special it is for somebody to be willing to get up every morning and put his life on the line, or her life on the line, for a complete stranger. 
To do it once is extraordinary, but to do get up and do that for a living day after day after day after day, and then when you tack on top of that the impact of COVID on law enforcement, I think there are close to 90 law enforcement officers around this country who died as a result of COVID. I mean you put all those things--partly because they're out there protecting the public, so they are more at risk. And it breaks my heart. 
SCOTT: Yeah. Director Miller? So how do you think--how does it make you feel when you see how badly law enforcement is being treated right now, and what are you doing to make sure people are safe? 
MILLER: My father was a career law enforcement officer. Of course in my current capacity I'm focused on international terrorism, but as a citizen and as a son of a father who dedicated his career, I'm also incredibly humbled by the commitment and the selfless service of our law enforcement men and women. 
SCOTT: Mr. Cuccinelli. 
CUCCINELLI: Senator, DHS has more law-enforcement officers than any other entity in the country, and so we take your question very seriously, and it's certainly something that we talk about in the leadership is maintaining that morale. They are doing something, as the director described, that no one else in America is asked to do this. Nobody else in this country we ask to get up every morning, put on a gun with a possibility of them using it, to stand between us and evil, and there is no real signs that evil is going away, so we're going to keep needing these folks. 
And I think back to George Washington's description of veterans is your ability to recruit your next round of troops--I'm paraphrasing of course--is going to be heavily dependent on how they see your treatment of the last round of troops, the veterans of course for him coming out of the Revolutionary War. And the same is true for our police officers. They deserve our respect in a way that very few other people in our society do, and what we have found is that while the public discussion can be very rough and tumble, I'll describe it, they respond very positively when they see leadership in their department going out and affirmatively defending them and taking the position you just described. 
So I know they appreciate it when they see you do it. I know they appreciate it when they see those of us in leadership at DHS do it because they tell us that. It really does matter a lot that you all in this body pay them the respect they're due. I'm sorry the resolution played out the way it did. I'm as shocked as you are just based on the subject matter. But it is very important that you all use your leadership to encourage law enforcement all across the country. 
SCOTT: I thank you for--by the way, thank you, Director Wray, thanks for reaching out. We had 51 members of law enforcement die in the line of duty in my years as governor, and I had the opportunity--I went to all their funerals, and you get to meet their families, and it's--I mean, it's you know, they almost all of them seem to have young kids, and your heart goes out to them. So thank you to each what you're doing. Please let anybody you come in contact with with regard to law enforcement know how much we appreciate them. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Senator Scott. Senator Paul. 
PAUL: I'd like to begin by wishing a speedy recovery to the two police officers in Louisville who were shot yesterday in the line of duty. I join Senator Scott and others in saying that we have to appreciate our police more generally. They are protecting us from the vandals, the marauders, the arsonists in our cities. And it's not just the Democrat proposition of defunding the police that threatens us. It's also the idea that if we don't appreciate our police, we won't have more volunteering to become policeman in the next generation, so I think it's absolutely imperative that we do show our appreciation for these people who are risking their lives to keep us safe. 
My wife and I know about this personally. As you saw from the video going into this, we were attacked by a mob in DC just a few weeks ago. For those of you who doubt that the mob had violent intent, immediately after we were safely into the hotel, or somewhat safe in our hotel, one of the police officers was assaulted and received stitches in his face, and I guess what bothered me is, you know, I commend them for their heroism. I truly believe they saved our lives. But the person who assaulted the policeman was from out of state. I think the federal charges were lodged, but then he was released on his own recognizance. I tweeted out somewhat snarkily, if you're looking for him, you may look in Kenosha. 
But I think we do have to investigate these people. And we have to put blame where blame is. We need to find out who is financing them. If you're from out of state and you attack someone in DC, I would think that the FBI or a federal authority should investigate, you know, how did he get there? Who's paying for it? I can tell you that Black Lives Matter is supporting these folks and that we shouldn't shy away from attributing blame where blame goes. When we were attacked, the head of Black Lives Matter in Louisville had this to say. She said, we can see the fear in their faces, and that's how we want them to live. 
Their goal is terrorism. They're admitting it. If you look at their exchanges online and social media, they are saying their goal is to terrorize public officials and really anybody. Many of the people in the restaurants that they are being terrorized are not public officials. But their goal is terror. And whether or not that equates to something that you can legally investigate, I don't know, but we should know that, and we should let corporate America know that. Corporate America is giving millions of dollars to something they perceive as an antiracist group. In reality it's a group that is funding terror and funding terrorists to go from city to city. 
I don't think probably anyone can comment directly on the police officer that was assaulted that was protecting my wife and I, but I guess in general, Director Wray, is a police officer being attacked by someone who came from another state, do you think that can fall under the purview of the FBI? Is the FBI in general investigating cases like this where people from out of state are doing something? You would think it would be a local crime to be investigated, but if they are from out-of-state, is there a federal angle to an investigation? 
WRAY: Well, Senator first let me say I appreciate your sympathy and appreciation to that officer, and while we're pleased that the offender was charged, obviously the release is concerning. I would say that when it comes to interstate travel there are sometimes federal charges that we can bring, so there are federal rioting charges that have an interstate nexus that we have started trying to use around the country where we can, and there are a variety of sort of interstate commerce type hooks that we can look to. We are aggressively looking for a lot of the same kinds of things that you are pointing to, funding, supply chains, networks, communications with others in different parts of the country. 
And certainly the interstate travelers are often some of the most serious offenders. I know that in Portland, for example, there were a couple of individuals that I can think of off the top of my head who were coming from a different state who were, in one case threatening to blow up a building, in another case attempting to attack a building, and charges were brought in both of those instances. So wherever we can find a tool or a legal, legally available weapon to go after those people, we're going to use it because while there are certainly a large number, even a majority of people out there who are protesting peacefully, it doesn't take very many, as you experienced, you and your wife in the really shocking video that was played, it doesn't take very many people to suddenly cause very serious harm. 
PAUL: And I think the frustration is is that there is one guy on the internet who has--I think he's been arrested 26 times, and there's got to be some sort of cumulative nature to that many crimes that we've got to be at some point able to hold them. I do think re-arresting is a good idea, and if I were in Portland I would arrest them all every night, the ones that are committing infractions, and it's not life in prison, but you should get 24 hours in a cell and a trial or a hearing the next day and be booked, but we've got to do something. And I think the lack of doing anything is encouraging more of this. 
The people who were in the mob that attacked us, within like--you know how the internet works--within 20 minutes people were isolating their faces and saying here's a picture of him in Louisville. Here's a picture of him in Memphis. Here's a picture of him in Portland. So there is some connection, and it costs money, you know, to travel places, and there were dozens staying in hotels near the White House that average over $500 a night. So I think it's important that we look at it. Now I'm very concerned about free speech and not going after groups for speech. I actually sympathize with some of the reforms. 
I had an act called the Breonna Taylor Act to get rid of no knock raids cause I think they endanger police officers and people behind on the raids. And many police officers actually agree that the no knock raids may not be necessary. But at the same time, if the trail leads to Black Lives Matter there is an important public service to the--the corporations who think they are giving money to a peaceful protest or to a peaceful antiracial group need to be aware if they are being flown around so there's an important I think call to not having more money flood into a group if that is what is happening. So all I would say is that we should not be afraid of you know, allegations that this is just a peaceful group so that we can't touch them. That we do need to trace the money from people that are committing cries and if it is coming from an organization that may have multi purposes and say they have a first amendment right they don't' have a right to fund mayhem. 
I hope it will be pursued. Feel free to respond to that or not. 
WRAY: Thank you, senator. Just two quick points one couldn't agree more on the repeat offender aspect of it and one of the things that we are doing in Portland and in other places is trying to work with state and local partners to essentially identify who is it that is going in and out of the state and local system either because they are getting released on bail otherwise. 
And see(PH) prioritize those individuals to see if there is some federal charge because often that can result in detention and more stiff sentences. Nd then on the funding piece following the money is kind of our bread and butter. It's something we are looking at as I said including, which I think goes a little bit to your last point including situations where somebody might be misrepresenting what it is they are fundraising for. So certain crowdsourcing activities where somebody contributes think they are giving or something that is First Amendment activity but in fact may be being used for something else that is much more pernicious. And so we are looking at that too. 
PAUL: And just one quick final comment the people who are being hurt the worst are the people who live in these communities. So the people who say I want to help people in the poor sections of Chicago or the poor sections of DC need to realize when you burn down the last pharmacy, when you burn down the last McDonalds or Walmart that it hurts the people who live there and many of these businesses wont' get back and that can't be emphasized enough from a humanitarian point of view. We got to end the violence cause you are hurting he very people you think you are trying to help. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Thanks, Senator Paul. I really do appreciate your comments and I really am sorry that you and your wife had to endure that type of abuse. Senator Portman. 
PORTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and as we have seen today our annual discussion about the threats to the homeland is full of threats. It's a busy time for all of you and I want to start by thanking the men and women who work for you and I hope you will pass along our respect and support for them we rely on them as Senator Paul has just indicated to keep us all safe and keep our communities safe. And at the state and local level but also the people who you represent here today. 
We've got a lot of threats we are in the middle of a presidential election and there are foreign actors trying to intervene in our election again that's a threat. We are experiencing these protests in the wake of these tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other events as I've repeated many times, of course I support people's right to protest peacefully it's protected by our Constitution. I also support police reform and it was discussed earlier that you know, some things have been blocked around here. We actually had a police reform bill that was very common sense and had a lot of provisions that were very appealing on a bipartisan basis. It was blocked even by consideration by the other side. I think that's cynical and I think we should have had that debate and discussion and we should have passed something including some ideas that Senator Paul just talked about. 
I got to tell you, the riots and particularly the damage to our communities, the arson, the looting, the desecration of property. By the way, when I say our communities often these are communities of color and nothing you know, upsets me more than seeing the entrepreneur in one of these communities like the African American guy in Ohio or the Hispanic woman I've seen in other news broadcasts who says, I spent my life building this business and how it has been destroyed. And of course. the harm to individuals to citizens and particularly the violence against federal, state and local officers. 
Director Wray said it was heartbreaking and I think that's a good way to put it. You know, these people are doing their job. And you know, by the way you know, they get paid very little compared to what a lot of people are getting paid around this place or frankly, even some of the demonstrators who are assaulting them you know, taking out their frustrations on these guys is not fair. It's unacceptable. 
I want to again express my condolences for Dave Underwood he was--was one of yours DHS protective service officer who was killed while trying to protect the courthouse in Oakland, California. 300 injuries we have heard today over 300 injuries have been sustained in Portland of course we wish all those officers a speedy recovery including getting their--their sight back and their--and their hearing back and it was just discussed that two officers were shot la--last night. And these two officers of course, we all wish them a speedy recovery. 
But to their families you talk about trying to recruit people into this business--wow, I wonder what their families think about that. I actually was with a family recently--it was two weeks ago--it was in Cleveland Ohio at a visitation for Officer Jimmy Skernovitz(PH) and Jimmy was one of your guys in a way Officer--Officer Skernovitz was working with the FBI and working with state and local law enforcement--Cleveland police detective on a violent crime taskforce, Operation Legend. He was gunned down in his car by three teenagers. Unprovoked just gunned down in his car. 
And his family was incredible I mean they were so courageous in response to this and--and so committed to the notion that Jimmy died in service to his country which is exactly what he wanted to do in life. And God bless him. It's like talking to the families of our military who have fallen. But this violence must stop. This too is a threat to our homeland. 
We've talked today as Director Miller has said that the terrorist groups Al Qaida, ISIS and others continue on the attack. That's a threat we cannot forget. We cannot take our eye off the ball. As we've heard from CISA in this committee consistently these cyber attacks are on the rise. And by the way, this committee has focused on that a lot and will continue to. We did a Permit Subcommittee Investigations recently about this issue and I think as you know, Deputy--Secretary Cuccinelli, I'm very concerned about the FSMA(PH) implementation in some of our federal agencies. They're just not doing it. They're not protecting themselves which means they are not protecting the taxpayers, not protecting the government. And written up some legislation on that but we got to work together to put the firewalls in place more effectively. 
So many other I'm going to ask about three specific threats quickly--the first of which is these transnational terror groups that are shipping poison into our communities. And they keep doing it. And it's increased and I'm pleased that 4 million pounds of hard drugs have been recently apprehended you know, crystal meth, heroin, cocaine and so on. And I do believe that the ultimate answer to this issue lies on the demand side and we have done a lot here. We have spent over $5 billion of additional federal money just in the last few years on prevention, on treatment, services, on longer term recovery and we got to keep that up. And unfortunately, we have seen reversal during the COVID period the last several months on overdose and overdose deaths after finally, finally getting to the point where we were making progress on that. 20 percent reduction in Ohio in 2018 of overdose deaths after three decades of increases. 
But now we're going the other way so we got to deal with the supply side too because when it flows into this country this poison its cheaper, more accessible. And I want to focus just for a second on fentanyl. We know it mostly comes from China. We know it mostly comes by the mail. The STOP Act you know, you all worked with us on that legislation we got it passed. It's supposed to keep this stuff from coming in from China. Just quickly--how do you think it's working and I know on either side of the panel here we got a lot of experience with the STOP Act. How is it working from a customs and border protection point of view and from an FBI point of view? 
CUCCINELLI: Well, from a CBP point of view this is you know, they've started aggressively pursuing small package inspections at a level that we have not done before and that has proven fruitful. Of course our adversaries adjust. They tend to be adjusting by going through Mexico that's their path of adjustment that we are observing. But we are going to keep up the pressure in that space if for no other reason it's like my comments earlier about driving people to the ports of entry if we can minimize their opportunity points we can focus our efforts all of us-- 
[*]CUCCINELLI: --Together on those avenues of approach that we know they are using. And we--we do need the help of this body to continue that effort. And I know that the commitment is there. I know especially on this sort of particular issue, senator, you've been very strong for a long time, and we very much appreciate that a DHS. 
PORTMAN: Well, let's keep the STOP Act in place. I think you're absolutely right. And--and it's not coming by mail from Mexico, as I understand it, as much as it's coming-- 
CUCCINELLI: --Right-- 
PORTMAN: --Overland, although-- 
CUCCINELLI: --Right-- 
PORTMAN: --It's some of both, so the STOP Act helped there too. I'm--I know I'm getting close to my--for my--over my time. And Mr. Chairman, I don't know if you wouldn't mind giving me a chance just quickly to ask about the two other threats. And we'll get--get back to you, Director Wray, in--in writing if that's okay. 
One is safeguarding our--our research. And I love what you said about the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. This threat from China and other countries who have systematically targeted our research and the most promising researchers is a threat to the homeland. It really is. 
And I guess what I would say is, would this new legislation that came out of this committee, the chairman marked it up, it's--you know, it's gone into the floor in the sense as--as part of a--a--a--a proposal by Senator McConnell, the Safeguarding American Innovation Act, would that help you, Director Wray, to do your job? 
You say you have opened every 10 hours another China related investigation, 2,500 open investigations. This, as you know, provides you a new criminal fraud charge under Title 18. With that give you the tools and help you to be able to protect the homeland from this threat? 
WRAY: Well, senator, I--I very much appreciate the legislation. We do think it will help. I want to just underscores some of the points that you've made there. I mean, from--from our perspective, and I've said this repeatedly and publicly since pretty early in my tenure as FBI director, that there is no adversary that presents a broader and more comprehensive threat to our--our democratic ideas, our innovation, our economic security than the government of China. 
We're up about 1300 percent in terms of economic espionage investigations that tie back to China over the past decade, 2,000 plus active investigations tied back to the government of China, by far the biggest chunk of our counter intelligence portfolio. China sees itself, on the issues that you're raising in terms of research, as engaged in an international talent war. And so, we have this perverse phenomenon where you got essentially a pipeline of U.S. technology, intellectual property, and research back to China for their nationalistic purposes, essentially misappropriating U.S. taxpayer dollars in the process. 
So, I appreciate the leadership you've shown through legislation and otherwise on this topic. We're trying to tackle it through investigations. I think we've had about a talent, plan, arrest a month almost this year. It covers almost every region of the country. We're also very concerned about China's military/civil fusion policy, where essentially they overtly are focused on channeling even civil--what might appear to be civilian research, intellectual property, and innovation back to advance their military aims. 
And as--as one illustration of that, as a certain members of this committee may know, we've now recently started discovering PLA researchers here in this country who were concealing-- 
PORTMAN: --People's Liberation Army-- 
WRAY: --Their ties back to-- 
PORTMAN: --Um-hmm-- 
WRAY: --The PLA. And so, that's a real concern as well. So, this is a major, major issue, and it's our highest counterintelligence priority for a reason, because it's going to shape what this country is like in 25 or 30 years. 
PORTMAN: Well, I--my time is expired, and I appreciate your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. Let--let me just say this. Your personal commitment to this is very much appreciated. And it wasn't always so if the FBI. As you know, when we had our hearing after our year-long investigation, it was shocking what we learned. 
And the FBI, to their credit, testified and said basically we've been asleep at the switch on this for a while, two decades, and we need to increase what we're doing in terms of prosecutions and investigations. And boy, they have. So, DOJ and FBI has really stepped up, and--and unfortunately it's absolutely necessary. 
So, my last question was for you, Mr. Cuccinelli, was about the Nonprofit Security Grant Program. I'm going to follow up with you in writing about that. We appreciate the additional funding. We think it's working. We've got some good experience back home with groups that are not just getting funding, but they're getting their expertise. 
They're getting the best practices. They're getting the professional help as to how to protect themselves. These are synagogues and churches and mosques and--pushing back against the domestic terrorism threat, including the Islamic extremists and white supremacists. So, we thank you for your support of that program. We hope it can continue. I know you've got a new grant program you're looking at that we'll follow up with. 
So, with that, thank you, gentleman, very much. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. 
JOHNSON: Senator Carper? 
CARPER: Thank you very much. I--I want to say while Senator Portman is still in the room, the legislation he referred to is bipartisan legislation. He and I are the co-authors. And I want to second his sentiments with respect to the good work the FBI is doing in his support of our efforts. This is legislation that should be before the Senate, should be debated before the Senate, and we should have the opportunity to see this is signed into law. I just wanted to put that to be-- 
PORTMAN: --Well said-- 
CARPER: --On the record. 
PORTMAN: Well said. Thank you. 
CARPER: I--I--I want to--to begin my--my questioning, Mr. Chairman and colleagues, and to say to our--let me just say to our--our witnesses, thank you for being here. Thank you for the work that you do. Thank you very much for the work that--of the people you lead do for all of us every single day. 
Before I ask a question, though, I--I just want to take maybe a minute to address yesterday's developments in, in Louisville, Kentucky. My sister lives in Winchester, Kentucky, not all that far from Louisville, so this is personal for our family. Yesterday we learned that no one has been charged in connection with Breonna Taylor's death. We need to know why. Breonna Taylor's family needs to know why. 
Meanwhile, all of us need to remember the words of Breonna Taylor's mother from earlier this summer, and here are her words. This is so much bigger than her, but we can't get justice with violence. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't help. It doesn't help her. It doesn't help us. She goes on to say it doesn't help the world we live in. You can't find violence with violence, the words of Breonna Taylor's mom. 
Add to her words the words just yesterday of our former vice president, Joe Biden. He--he said violence is never and can never be the answer. Violence is never, can never be the answer. And as we seek the whole truth in the death of Breonna Taylor, we must not sully her memory by perpetrating the same violence that took her from her family. Meanwhile, I would ask that all of us pray for the two police officers who were shot last night in Louisville as we pray for Breonna Taylor's family and especially her mom. 
Now, I want to turn to the domestic terrorism, if--if I can. This will be a question for Director Wray. Director Wray, tragically in recent years we've seen an increase in targeted violence, especially gun violence perpetrated in this country, as you know better than any of us. You may have heard me say that in order to address the problem, we need to address not the symptoms of the problems but the root causes of those problems. 
When I was privileged to lead this committee as its chairman, I worked with then the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, to ensure that the department had the needed resources to address the root causes of violent extremism through its Office of Community Partnerships. Director Wray, my two questions, if you will. Why are we seeing such a rise in racially and ethnically motivated extremism and violence in this country in recent years? Why? 
WRAY: Senator, I appreciate your concerns and I--I share--I share many of those concerns. I guess I would say the why is something that we all struggle to really get our arms around. I--I think one important part of that phenomenon, which I've referred to earlier, is the role of social media. And as I said, terrorism today now moves at the speed of social media. 
And so, in effect, what you have is a phenomenon where disaffected, angry, hateful people who are maybe separated geographically and maybe are largely lone actors are now able to essentially spin each other up by being virtually connected in a way that--that they couldn't before. And the more of that occurs in the--through encrypted messaging platforms and places like that as well, the more that I think we can expect to see, unfortunately and tragically. 
You know, the person--the angry person who wants to lash out who's living at home in mom's basement maybe before was all by himself. Now he's talking to similarly situated people all over the country and, indeed, all over the world and is more likely to get encouraged and galvanized and to take hateful and of foreign ideas and turn them into dangerous, all too often lethal violence. 
CARPER: Thank you very much. When I was--my sister and I were kids growing up, we grew up in Danville, Virginia, the last capital of the Confederacy. And I remember taking a--a school trip. My whole seventh grade class went to Richmond, and we had the opportunity actually meet the governor of Virginia. I mean, we were like 12 years old. It was an amazing experience, one I'll never forget. 
A couple of years ago, there was a demonstration. There was violence in--in Richmond, Virginia, as you'll recall. We had people there that were folks from the Ku Klux Klan, people who are instigating racial violence. Death occurred, and the president--our president was asked to comment, and he said there are good people on both sides. I would suggest that words like that from our president give courage and strength to racial extremists to act out and to be not just vocal, but actually to embrace violence, and that's something that needs to stop. I--let me ask, how is the FBI working to ensure that when you come, Director Wray, when you come before this committee next year, the threat from domestic extremists is reduced, and how can Congress be helpful in that regard? How can--make us a guided missile. 
WRAY: Well, senator, I think a few things. How are we working? We've--I've asked all of our joint terrorism task forces, which means that we're able to leverage not just FBI personnel, but you know essentially 4500 investigators around the country, to make sure that they are focusing on domestic terrorism in addition to international terrorism. They were already doing that, but we--one of the things we did just recently was elevate racially motivated violent extremism to the same national threat priority band as ISIS and homegrown violent extremists who are the folks here who are inspired by foreign terrorist organizations. 
We also created a--I created a domestic terrorism hate crimes fusion cell, which brings together the expertise of both our domestic terrorism investigators and analysts with our hate crimes investigators and analysts, and that's designed to make sure that we're getting the synergies that are necessary there. And we've already made significant progress there. The first time that I can think of where we were able to proactively disrupt an attack using a hate crime charge involving the attempt to attack a synagogue in Colorado that I referenced earlier. 
Certainly we need agents, analysts. We need data analytic tools. And we ultimately are going to need a solution to the end to end encryption problem which plagues law enforcement and on an increasingly, increasingly constant basis. And so there are a number of things that we would potentially turn to Congress for help with there. 
CARPER: Thanks, Mr.--Mr. Chairman, I have one last question, and can you indulge me for about two more minutes? 
JOHNSON: Okay. 
CARPER: Thanks very much. Mr. Wray, can you give us some examples of what Russia, China and Iran have been doing to spread disinformation and misinformation ahead of the election? How does the Bureau were to proactively combat this misinformation? 
WRAY: Well, I would refer you to the ODNI public statement that is the unclassified version of what the intelligence community assesses from our foreign adversaries with respect to election interference, and it goes through a description of China, Russia and Iran. All three countries are highly sophisticated actors with different capabilities pursuing different means. 
In the case of the Russians and the Iranians, heavy use of online tools, for example, you've heard about the use of social media. We're seeing online journals, fake placement of stories, things like that, use of proxies by the Russians, for example. On the Chinese, as I mentioned before, you know, in many ways it's our greatest counterintelligence threat to this country, and their maligned foreign influence efforts are different, as Mr. Cuccinelli said, different from the Russians, but much broader and wider in terms of their reach to not just federal officials, but state and local officials, and they use economic levers very heavily. We're mostly concerned about subversive, undeclared coercive or criminal means. There's obviously all kinds of overt lobbying that occurs by these countries, but those are the means that we're most concerned about. 
CARPER: Of the three countries, Director Wray, which poses the biggest threat to the upcoming election versus the longer term? Which of the three countries, Russia, China and Iran, which poses the biggest threat to the sanctity of this upcoming election? 
WRAY: I don't think I could really rank them. I mean all three are ones that we're very concerned about in different ways. So it's not really an apple to apple comparison. Certainly, as I've said before, the Russians are engaging, and as the ODNI statement on behalf of the intelligence community says, they're engaged in a range of measures, but also the Chinese are recently been expanding their influence efforts, which is part of why after the midterm elections we, with the foreign influence task force that I created early in my tenure, we broadened and significantly added resources to that task force to add not just to Russia, but to add China and Iran, as well, because those countries are very much looking for different ways to take a page out of the maligned foreign influence playbook that they've seen elsewhere. 
CARPER: Director Wray, thank you so much. Thanks to all the witnesses. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your generosity with an extra three minutes and 39 seconds. Thank you. 
JOHNSON: Senator Hawley. 
HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, director and the other witnesses for being here. Let me just pick up on something that you testified to earlier, Director Wray. You talked about evidence of organized the tactical activity by some groups as part of the recent rioting and violent looting that we have seen across the country. In Louisville, of course, last night we saw egregious acts of violence, two police officers shot. I've seen this in my own state. We've had nine police officers, nine, shot in St. Louis, in that city alone, since June, just since the month of June. 
There appears to be some footage that is circulating on the internet from Louisville last night that shows a parked U-Haul waiting for a crowd, and which it looks like contains signs that say things like abolish the police along with shields and perhaps other paraphernalia that could be used for violence. I understand the FBI is going to assist in investigating the shootings that happened in Louisville, but I want to ask you, to what extent are you investigating coordination between extremist elements and the violence that we've seen across the country? 
WRAY: So Senator, I appreciate the question. As you anticipate in it, we are very focused on what we would call the most dangerous actors, which tend to be the ones who are most coordinated and therefore potentially able to cause the most harm and most damage. So we are looking in a number of places without reference to any specific investigation. We are aggressively investigating funding streams, tactics, logistics, travel, networks, that kind of thing. 
What we are finding is that in a lot of the activity is organized at what I would call more of a tactical level than a strategic level, and organized more locally and regionally in small groups or nodes than in a more structured, hierarchical way across the country. But that in no way, in no way diminishes how serious and dangerous it is. We don't view how nationally organized something is as a proxy for how dangerous it is, and so we're aggressively investigating all the kinds of things that you would expect us to be investigating in pretty much every state in the country right now. 
HAWLEY: And these global and regional nodes are, is it safe to say, using social media as a means to communicate with each other as they plan their activities? 
WRAY: They are, but let me just add a finer point on that. We see a lot of communication on social media in what I would call sort of more benign ways, but a lot of the communication with each other that's the more telltale or revealing is happening locally, sometimes through encrypted channels that they think will cause them to be able to hide from law enforcement, and in some cases they are able to hide from law enforcement, which is a real frustration. But we're taking steps to try to make sure that we can break through some of those barriers and try to uncover some of the stronger evidence of what we're seeing reports of around the country. 
HAWLEY: Well, thank you for your attention to this, and I certainly hope that you continue to devote every resource that you can to these investigations to the potential coordination here and especially for violence that is being directed against law enforcement, whether it's in Louisville, whether it's in St. Louis, whether it's in Seattle, Portland, wherever. It doesn't matter. Law enforcement when they are under attack in what appears to be in some instances, again, a coordinated fashion, particularly of course across state lines and is coordinated across state lines, that I think deserves your attention, and I am glad that you are giving attention to that. 
Let me switch gears and ask you a little bit about Chinese espionage and COVID. You in May of this year, you released a public warning to organizations researching COVID-19 with an eye towards the vaccine, you released a warning about possible Chinese espionage activity related to the pharmaceutical research, health research, and ultimately vaccine development. Can you give us a sense here, are Chinese hackers still trying to steal research related to a COVID 19 vaccine what's the latest that you know? 
WRAY: Well, certainly as you reference we are--are seeing very aggressive activity by the Chinese and in some cases by others to target our COVID related research whether it's vaccines, treatments, testing technology, etcetera. And sometimes you can almost without being too descriptive in an open setting we can almost see a--a track like a news report from some company or a research institution that's--it's announcing or revealing some progress. Of course, a lot of this is getting discussed int eh media and almost within days we will see cyber targeting that ties back to Chinese actors focusing on these institutions. So that's why we working with DHS though it was so important to put out information. 
We are also engaging as the FBI does all the time directly with targeted organizations, victims, institutional victims to help them better protect themselves. But the Chinese cyberthreat is a major, major concern and something that we are prioritizing through our national cyber investigative taskforce which brings together intelligence community and law enforcement assets together to try to take a whole of government response to this. 
HAWLEY: Give my your sense of what you are seeing in terms of the--the hacking activity and the espionage activity. Is it directed towards end product as your sense or do you get any sense that hackers or other agents of China, the Chinese government are trying to disrupt the research itself interfere with the development--either the collection of data or the vaccine? 
WRAY: Trying to think of the best way to summarize what we're seeing. I guess what I would say is it's clearly targeting the former that is targeting information about progress in much the same way the same playbook that we are seeing from--from Chinese hackers across other kinds of industries and research and innovation. Rather than innovate themselves they're trying to essentially jump the front of the line by stealing information from others. 
HAWLEY: Well thank you for again your work on this and your continued attention to what is it's obviously a vital national security interest of this nation. Final question here just as I--as I go. What about connection to the Chinese government? We've been talking about Chinese hackers or Chinese espionage. Have you seen any clear connection or how much clear connection have you seen to the Beijing government itself in these efforts? 
WRAY: Well, of course what you're raising there is the very important question of attribution and the standards that the intelligence community uses for attribution are different for say maybe private sector might use. But as I sometimes say nothing says attribution like an indictment. And as you know we've brought some significant indictments against Chinese hackers that do tie back to the MSS specifically on a number of occasions and these are targeting not just American companies, American research institutions but also similar institutions among some of our closest allies and targeting PII, personal identifiable information of Americans. Chinese hackers ha essentially stolen the PII of about half the adult population of the United States. 
HAWLEY: That's a--that's a shocking number. Thank you for your work on this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
JOHNSON: Senator Hawley. I believe Senator Sinema is-- 
SINEMA: Yes. That's right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate our witness joining us today for this important hearing. As a senator from a border state I know it's critical that we work together to tackle threats against the homeland and along our nation's borders. I remain committed to working every day in a bipartisan fashion to secure Arizona's border, keep Arizona safe and ensure that migrants are treated humanely and fairly. A key part of this overall effort is successfully tackling the challenge at our nation ports of entry. 
So my first question is for Mr. Cuccinelli. Arizona ports of entry are among the busiest in the nation and the goods and people flowing through them play critical roles in both Arizona's and the nations economy. CBP employees work hard every day to facilitate the flow of lawful trade and travel. But our nation continues to struggle with significant amounts of illicit drugs into our nation through our ports. 
With a month left to go in fiscal year 2020 CBP is reporting they have already seized more marijuana, methamphetamine and fentanyl at ports of entry than they did in 2019. So I strongly believe that technology is part of the answer here which is why I worked with Senator Cornyn to introduce a southwest border security technology improvement act to improve DHS technology planning. 
But I want to get your take on this challenge. What actions does DHS need to taken ow at our ports of entry to better respond to this ongoing threat this flow of drugs represents? 
CUCCINELLI: Thank you, senator. And zeroing in on your question in the ports of entry--the--the most important program running is the nonintrusive inspection effort. As I mentioned earlier one of the advantages of the expanded security along the border including the building of the border wall is that we are funneling more traffic from between ports of entry into ports of entry. And that means that we are able to confront these threats on our terms and on our turf. Doesn't mean they're not dangerous. Doesn't mean there aren't a lot of them but as we have had great success in the last four years in seizing hard drugs the ones that do the most harm in the most communities in your state in every state of course, we've seen great success in that area as I said in my opening remarks. 
But we will do better still as we expand the availability of nonintrusive inspection ability and you mentioned how busy the ports in Arizona are. You are absolutely correct. One of the qualities of this particular technology and I know it's part of why you support adding technology to the suite of problem-solving tools is that it increases the efficiency of the port itself. It operates in such a way that doesn't' require as much manpower or time to accomplish the same security goals. That is the very definition of increasing efficiency. 
So we're also using nearby not in Arizona yet but hopefully to come soon, more autonomous surveillance around ports of entry to provide greater situational awareness and security to not just our employees but everybody coming through those ports of entry as well. So I--I look forward to expanding those efforts in the future and--and your help and cooperation and support of that is much appreciated. 
SINEMA: Thank you. For my next question I'd like to ask both Mr. Cuccinelli and Director Wray to weigh in. The entities behind these drugs are transnational criminal organizations. After the TCOs move their contraband through our ports they launder their profits. And recent media reports indicate that TCOs have been able to use major banking institutions for money laundering purposes. So what additional steps do DHS and the FBI need to take together and separately to cut off these TCOs access to money laundering? 
CUCCINELLI: So, Senator I'll start and then turn it over to Director Wray. As I mentioned up front one of the areas we believe that you all in Congress can be most helpful to us in this particular battle with these most evil people in the western hemisphere are to provide us some tools that allow designation somewhere below a foreign terrorist organization because of the sweeping capture of much of society because of how these organizations are interconnected with the Mexican society so thoroughly. But above the level of mere prosecution one person at a time that allow us to attack the organizations at a strategic level and bring them down to help Mexico regain more control of its own country and protect ours at the same time. So that's an area we would be very happy to partner with you on. It's definitely an area where there's potential for improvement. 
And one of the key areas you touch on is money. You know, Mr. Miller talked about ISIS and Al Qaida in particular. They are out they believe on some holy--holy war and the folks in the TCOs they are not out there for what they think of as God or maybe they do but it's for money. And if we can get at the money and start to cut off their ability to gain the benefits of their evil produce in the case of drugs and trafficking in the case of humans we are going to really be able to start to put a major dent in their operations in their threat to both Mexico and to the United States. 
WRAY: I--I would agree with what Mr. Cuccinelli. 
[*]WRAY: --Just said. I would just add that we have found over 112 years at the FBI that what--whatever kind of enterprise we're talking about, in this case the transnational criminal organizations, if you really want to dismantle the enterprise, you have to go after the money as well, because it affects the money becomes their infrastructure. 
And so, you know, the value of global crime ranges between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, but about $300 billion are attributed to US-based TCOs, transnational criminal organization networks. And so, figuring out a way to cut off their access to money is ultimately going to be one of the most critical parts of making sure that the strategy is not just effective but enduring. 
SINEMA: Thank you, Director Wray, and thank you, Mr. Cuccinelli. Mr. Chair, I do have further questions, but in the interest of my time expiring, I'll submit them for Mr. Cuccinelli and for Director Wray, and I'll yield back the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
JOHNSON: I appreciate that, Senator Sinema. 
So, let--let me begin first by saying that, of all the listed of threats that I began hearing with, and I've been dealing with, I think I mentioned, border security, we've probably done a pretty good job of covering most, but I didn't put a stopwatch on this. I think it's also true and kinda confirms what--what I ended up with talking about, what I believe is our current greatest threat to our democracy. And that literally is the rioting, the anarchy, the fact that the--the adherence to the rule of law is actually a question in this country today. 
And I think probably there was more time devoted during this hearing, more questions asked, more--more answers given in terms of what we're seeing right now. So, I appreciated that. I want to--I want to ask Mr. Cuccinelli, as a former attorney general, one of the things I'm highly concerned about, again, just the--the--the lack of adherence to the rule of law, the rejection of it, as we saw in the protests with--in Louisville yesterday because people didn't agree with what happened in a grand jury. 
One of the things that disturbs me is the movement toward anti-bail laws, the fact that we actually have people donating to organizations that will pay bail so that we, in effect, have what we saw at the border, catch and release. Now we have catch and release in our cities. Can you just speak to that? And by the way, Senator Paul talked about how the officer who was assaulted that had protected him, the person who assaulted him was charged and then released, and don't know whether he'll ever be prosecuted because I'm not sure if he'll ever be found. 
So, Mr. Cuccinelli, can you just kind of speak to my concern about this movement toward anti-bail laws, individuals that are paying to bail people out so they can get right back on the street and riot the next night? 
CUCCINELLI: Senator, that--that is a major concern. It does--it does invoke state and local authority to a significant degree, not necessarily in DC were Congress can have a say. Senator Paul did touch on this earlier. 
And we see this re--almost recycling of criminals because they walk out in so many jurisdictions, whether it's New York or Portland. The--the notion that anti-bail legislation is somehow a reform that improves the criminal justice system is--honestly escapes me. And--and mind you, that's coming from someone who has been a 25 year advocate for criminal justice reform, including what was passed by the Congress and President Trump less than two years ago. 
You know, so, that's the perspective that I come to this from, including my time as attorney general. This was not an issue we faced in Virginia because we didn't have localities, nor did we have at the state level this sort of treatment of bail as a punishment as opposed to a safety mechanism and a part of the--of the justice process, which is what we're seeing in other parts of the country. 
And I would just note also, Senator Portman made comments that I wanted to dovetail off that are similar to yours, Mr. Chairman. One of the most disturbing aspects of the summer of violence has been the overt encouragement of many who are in governmental positions of leadership, whether it's the speaker of the house attacking law enforcement using phrases like storm troopers to describe federal law enforcement doing their job properly. 
There wasn't even any question on her part about them not doing the job right. And these are people doing the job she, as a member of Congress, has cast for them. Or if it's Mayor Wheeler in Portland, who's encouraging violence. And we see this rife across large swaths of--of our political arena. I appreciate Senator Carper's comments in a referencing Breonna Taylor's mother's comments. I think those were extremely appropriate and they're helpful. And the--and--and we appreciate hearing them from leadership in this country. 
But so much of the political leadership in the country has encouraged this violence. It's been a shocking aspect to the last four months that I find, as a former attorney general and in my current role at the Department of Homeland Security, just shocking and--and--and is really contrary to the ideals and values of this country. 
JOHNSON: Well, it--it's a surprise to no one when--when we put forward this greater leniency, not that that's what's happening. That's what anti-bail laws are. It's certainly what happens when people contribute to organizations that bail people out and put them back on the street. That--of that is greater leniency that is leading to greater lawlessness. It should come as no surprise. 
So, Senator Carper asked, you know, are there things that we should do. Do we need to strengthen penalties? Do we need to potentially create new law--new crimes? Now, I'll ask Director Wray. I know Attorney General Barr has--had, you know, spoken about, whether he mused about it or whether he's--he's serious about charging people with sedition. What can we do to gain control over our cities? 
Again, more--almost 570 of these peaceful protests turned to riots, violence, and death. This is completely unacceptable. We need to get control of the situation. What do we need to do to get control of the situation? 
WRAY: Well--well, certainly, Mr. Chairman, you touched on one issue, which is it's hard enough to make sure that the men and women of law enforcement can--can do what they need to do to arrest the people the first time without having to go back out and re-arrest the same person over and over again. And Senator Paul touched on that a little bit in his comments as well. 
I--as I said I think in response to one of your colleague's questions, when federal, state, and local law enforcement all work together, which we do all the time around this country and do it promptly, that's when we're able to see the best results and everybody looking for what they can best contribute to the phenomenon. 
And of course, in your home state, while there was significant damage in a short period of time, comparatively quickly, I say compared to some other parts of the country, different parts of law enforcement all banded together, worked hand-in-hand and managed to bring law and order much more quickly by comparison. So, while there was significant and tragic damage there, and of course some fatalities and injuries, it could have been a heck of a lot worse. But I think that illustrates how important partnership is to dealing with this particular problem. 
JOHNSON: Thank you, Director Wray. Senator Portman, I'll just ask you again. I know you've--you've stayed behind as a backup. I appreciate that with me being remote. Do you have a couple more questions before I--I've got a few more myself. 
PORTMAN: Well, let--let me just, if I could, follow up a little bit on--on one. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I told the chairman earlier I--I thought I was the last speaker when I questioned the last time, so I--I went a little longer because I was the only one in the room. But in this new virtual world, we had others, so I apologize to my colleagues for taking more time. 
The--the third threat I did want to talk about was this domestic terrorism threat. And sometimes it's white supremist, anti-Semitic, as an example, hateful attacks or--or sometimes it's Islamic extremists, but this is something that, again, the department has begun to focus on more, Mr. Cuccinelli, I understand that DHS recently released to the implementation plan for your counterterrorism and targeted violence strategic framework. 
And this committee, again, has been very active on a particular part of the response, which is these nonprofit security grant programs. It basically is a FEMA grants program that goes out usually to a faith-based organization, say a synagogue, a church, or a mosque. But all nonprofits are eligible, and it's for security enhancements, and now can be used, thanks to DHS, even for armed security. 
But a lot of it is just about getting the expertise, you know, being sure that these organizations know where do you place the cameras, you know, how do you ensure that things are locked, and--and you can help them up by just doing a walk-through often. 32 organizations in Ohio have received a combined total of $2.3 million in grants in Fiscal Year 2020, and they are using it well in my view. And I've had a chance to visit with them. 
One thing we did last year that I thought was quite effective is we had a conference in the--in Ohio, had it in Columbus, Ohio, and we had the FBI there, Director Wray. They did a great job. But we also had DHS there, Secretary Cuccinelli, and they did a great job of just explaining what the threat was and--and--and kind of starting down the process of, you know, what do you do to respond to it. 
And the folks in the room--you know, this was the Sikh community, the Muslim community, the Jewish community, and the Christian community. Everybody was there. 
People really appreciated it, and I think that's one thing to think about is the possibility of doing more of these around the country where you have a conference and bring together some of the leadership just so people get a better sense, one, of what is going on in the real world out there in terms of the threat and it's not a, you know, it's not a classified environment, but you would be able to provide some very good information, and then second, you know, what do you do about it? 
So that's my question to you is, what more can we do? I know you have a new grant program. I'd like to hear about that. But if the two of you could speak--or all three of you speak briefly about this issue, that would be great. 
CUCCINELLI: Yeah, just this month the first tranche of the new grant dollars, I want to say $10 million, went out to 29 recipients, and that is--so much of the DHS responsibility in the domestic arena is prevention. It goes hand-in-hand with standing up TVTP, the office there to target--for targeted violence, and we're doing it--some people are familiar with the UK model. They have this big, huge group of people works for their federal government that goes out to try to interdict terrorism, not in a law enforcement fashion, but more in a, more like an intervention before violence occurs. 
That is a very different model than we are taking. We have just started building out. We've got our first 12 full-time employees for regional directors to expand partnerships so that we get a whole of America, including working with exactly those nonprofits you're talking about, Senator, to integrate them into our preventive efforts, both planning for their resistance to potential for assaults, but also for their partnership in intervening when they see people going down a path that may lead them to violence. 
And so that's the approach that we're taking in that office. It's one of the areas of greatest expansion that you'll see over the course of the next year at the Department of Homeland Security as we grow that effort out into communities across the country, and certainly you describe one way that those contacts can be made more deeply and more quickly. And we're very open to repeating that sort of performance. 
PORTMAN: Well, thank you. I appreciate the commitment to it. I think it does make sense, and in a sense you're leveraging the federal dollar significantly by getting this cooperation. As Director Miller knows, in Columbus, Ohio, I think the first indictment was made several years ago of an Islamic terrorist who FBI had worked with and through informant, and we were able to stop a horrific act. What really happened was that the community, the Muslim community in Columbus, Ohio, was cooperating with local, state, federal law enforcement to be able to find that individual and to prevent what would have been a terrible loss of life. So that's an example where just having those relationships made a big difference, and it was at every level of government. I don't know if you have any thoughts on this, either Director Wray or Director Miller. 
WRAY: I guess I would just add that I think community engagement is something that's critical to dealing with what we consider the biggest threat to the homeland, which is this combination of homegrown violent extremists and domestic violent extremists, all of whom are typically lone actors, easily radicalized online, attacking soft targets with readily accessible weapons. And because that's such a challenge for law enforcement, the one thing that we've seen, both with the attacks we've thwarted and prevented and unfortunately the attacks that have occurred that we've investigated after the fact, is that almost every time, if you look back, there was someone along the way, a friend, a family member, a coworker, a neighbor, a classmate what have you, who knew the person well enough to notice the transformation from radicalization of whatever kind it was to mobilization. 
And so you've often heard the saying if you see something, say something. And most of us when we hear that, we think the unattended backpack in the Greyhound bus terminal or something, and of course we want people to call when that happens, but we're trying to push out through all of our field offices, and I've been to all 56 of them and met with communities I think in every single one, if you see something about somebody we need you to say something. 
And I've been encouraged by those instances where sometimes having wrestled with great interpersonal demons, you know, a family member, a parent will say--and think about how hard that is--you know, my child, you know, my 18, 19-year-old child is going off the rails, and I'm concerned he might do something, and they call us. And it's a heck of a lot better situation if we--both for them, and more importantly for the public, if we can do something before that person acts. 
PORTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Director. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
JOHNSON: Thanks, Senator Portman. And again, thanks for sticking around and backing me up. Director Miller, I feel a little bad that you haven't been fielding a whole lot of questions and providing a whole lot of answers. I'd like to think it's because the foreign threats that the National Counterterrorism Center is normally known to address have been reduced, but I know that's not the case. I think the main reason is kind of what I stated in my opening, is that the unrest, the rioting, the lawlessness, the anarchy on the streets of America are just posing a more pressing risk and a greater risk to our overall democracy. But I did want to give you a quick opportunity here at the tail end of the hearing here. Is there anything else you think that's important to the American people understand about what you're trying to do to keep this nation safe, the men and women in your agency? 
MILLER: Chairman, I'm not offended in the least. I think that's really a testimonial or a testament to the success we've had in the last 19 years that it is no longer the principal concern of this committee and others, and that's all right. That's what we wanted. We said this was going to be a generational war. We didn't want it to be a multigenerational war. So I take great solace in the fact that we're talking about other things for a change. 
I just want to highlight, in closing, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to make a few comments. We just need to finish this thing and maintain our focus and not--to use a cliche--take our foot off the gas too soon, and the support of this committee and the Senate and Congress at large is so important to that. And I really thank you for the opportunity to make a few comments. 
JOHNSON: I appreciate the point you made about 2011, backing out of Iraq way too early, which gave rise to ISIS and the caliphate, and you know all that terror that resulted from that. So we have to learn from that type of blunder. We have to learn those types of lessons. 
Finally, Director Wray, this is not on threats, but I just have to take this opportunity to ask you a couple of questions about our investigation and the unfortunate fact that my frustration level got to the point where I had to subpoena the FBI now. I appreciate the fact that we've had conversations and since that point in time the FBI has gotten--has become more responsive, but the fact of the matter is we're in our second extension. My staff continues to not obtain the materials. They're having to go into the reading room, which is very inefficient and quite honestly so much of the material they are reviewing is not censored; it's not overly classified. There's no reason we can't take possession of it. 
So I think my first question is, you know, really ask you to kind of look into that, be a little bit more open with the information that I think Congress certainly deserves, and quite honestly the American people have the right to know what all happened. But can you make that commitment to really take a look at that and prod the people that work under you to make this--this--this kind of information readily available directly to our committee to have it in our position? 
WRAY: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I will certainly drill into it further and have my staff look and see if there are ways in which we can improve the process. The reading room construct that you've described is of course a process that we and others in the intelligence community use with really all committees for this kind of information, but we have surged additional resources to your request, and we've brought staff from multiple divisions. Of course we're working with other agencies, and a lot of times the information, or at least the parts of the information that make something classified, are other agencies' information, and that makes it more complicated, but we're going to continue to work as hard as we can in good faith to be responsive and accommodating, and I appreciate your forbearance and the conversations we've had lately. 
JOHNSON: Okay. Well, I appreciate that. One particular piece of information that is frustrating my staff is there are--and they are unclassified text messages of Andrew McCabe which are not being made available to us. So would you commit to making those things available to us, delivered to us in our position? 
WRAY: Well, I will be happy to look into that and have someone get back to you as quickly as we can about where that stands. 
JOHNSON: Okay, appreciate it. In the Department of Justice Inspector General Horowitz's report, former assistant director Bill Priestap was quoted as saying that the FBI did not have any indication whatsoever as of May 2017 that the Russians were running a disinformation campaign. Because my staff uncovered four classified footnotes--and again, I think that just points to why this is so important that we make this information available--but in those four classified footnotes we now know the FBI in early October 16 the Crossfire Hurricane team actually did obtain information from a Steele sub-source that ""He was suspected of being linked to Russian intelligence services and rumored to be a former KGB SVR officer."" 
In January 2017, the FBI started interviewing those sub sources and found out that Steele's reporting was misstated or exaggerated that was based on rumor and speculation that the sub-source never expected Steele to put the primary sub-source's statements in reports or presented as fact. That he or she made it--that clear--made it clear to Steele that she had no proof to support the statements from her sub-source and it was just to talk. Word of mouth. Hearsay. Conversations you have with friends over beers. Statements made in jest. 
So again, the FBI had indications of possible info--possible infiltration, but--of the Steele--Steele organization by--by Russian intelligence services. Again, this was in January of 2017. So that indication of a sub-source possibly being key--KGB officer in October 2016. In January 2017, they found confirmation of that and how grossly unreliable the Steele dossier was. And yet, the investigation continued. 
And it continued to the point where we set up these special counsel to take a look at this largely based on the Steele dossier. So I think my question on this is, as the current FBI director, do you believe the Crossfire Hurricane investigation should have proceeded at all once they--once the FBI knew that the KGB was the KGB might have been one of the Steele sub-sources and that Russia this information was contained in the Steele dossier? 
WRAY: Well first, Mr. Chairman, let me say there's let me try to your answer your question this way. I think the Inspector General's report about the Crossfire Hurricane investigation describes conduct that I consider unacceptable, unrepresentative of who the FBI is as an organization and cannot be allowed to be repeated. And I've implemented over 40 corrective measures to address those issues. 
Some of what you are touching on as relevant as well to be ongoing John Durham investigation with which we are fully cooperating even to the point of having agents who are working on it with him. So I want to be a little bit careful about how I weigh in on that. 
But of course, as you know, the Justice Department has concluded that the Carter Page FISA applications, at least after that date, should not have been submitted. And I believe--of course, of course, all this happened before I became FBI director, but I believe that DOJ officials who were around at the time have now said they would not have signed those applications. So I think to some extent, that speaks for itself. 
JOHNSON: From my standpoint, it's pretty obvious that past January 2017, there should have been no further investigation into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia. The--the information backing that predicate to investigation crumbled and simply didn't support it any further. 
My final question, you said you weren't FBI director back then, but you were in March of 2018. And in March of 2018, the FBI provided briefing to the Senate intelligence--Select Committee on Intelligence in which they briefed that committee that the Steele reporting was reliable. Now again, we just talked about what the FBI knew and when they knew it. As early as October 2016 and certainly by January 2017 that the Steele dossier was not reliable. 
So my question for you is that happened on your watch. How--how could that happen? How could the FBI go in and brief the Senate Select Committee intelligence over a year later when they knew that Steele dossier was not reliable and brief Senate committee that it was? 
WRAY: Well, Mr. Chairman, the issue here you're raising is one that I've been in close contact with Chairman Graham about. I will say this. The briefing in questions, as I understand it was a staff to staff briefing and it was happening at a time when we were largely in stand down mode because of the special counsel investigation. So obviously, I'm concerned about what I've heard about that briefing, but I probably for right now should just leave it at that. 
JOHNSON: Well, I just want to ask, are there members--or their employees of the FBI that were part of that briefing that are still employees and has there been any--any disciplinary action taken against those individuals? Because just saying it's an FBI briefing to staff--Steele FBI briefing Congress, this is a year after the fact that we knew that Steele dossier was not reliable. 
WRAY: Well first, let me say that describing it as a staff briefing, that--that is in no way intended to suggest that that's not important. But second, as to disciplinary action, I believe that all of the most senior executives involved in the investigation and including in that who participated in that briefing are all gone from the FBI. Some cases people have been fired, other cases people have retired or resigned all on my watch. 
As far as disciplinary action beyond that, every individual who's referenced in the inspector general's report at any level, even in passing has been referred to our office of professional responsibility and our inspection division for possible disciplinary action. Now, these tend to be people who are more at a line level and as far as disciplinary action towards them, that is largely then a little bit on it stand still in order to accommodate Mr. Durham and his investigation at his request. There are certain steps that we have to wait on in order to let him complete his investigation with--with which we are, of course, fully cooperating, as the Attorney General has--has said quite publicly on a number of occasions. 
JOHNSON: I appreciate your answer and listen, I think we share the same goal here. We have to restore the credibility to the FBI and the only way to do that is the FBI has got to come clean. If needed, it has to clean house to a certain extent. But the American people need to understand what happened and they need to have assurance that the FBI will take corrective actions and hopefully put policies in place where this will never happen again. 
So again, look forward to working with you. Really encourage full cooperation, expeditious cooperation. The American people have a right to know. They should have known, quite honestly, it years ago. 
Again, I want to thank all the witnesses for your service, for your sacrifice. As was said by most members of this committee, please convey to the men and women that work with you our appreciation for their services, sacrifice. Again, I need to underscore the point. I truly believe the vast majority of Americans are so appreciative of what law enforcement does--does everyday day in and day out trying to keep our cities, our states, this country safe and I think it is just an abomination, quite honestly, that there is this defund the police movement, that there's so many people attacking or enforcement. 
We need to support law enforcement, as a number of members certainly pointed out that how are we going to recruit the fine men and women that put their lives on the line to keep us safe if we keep denigrating and we keep attacking them? So I hope that people hearing this--this hearing today understand that there is a great deal of support for law enforcement. I think that's by and large the vast majority of Americans. 
So again, God bless everybody in law enforcement. God bless everybody in your departments and agencies. With that, the record will remain open for 15 days until October 12 at 5:00 p.m. for the submission of statements and questions for the record. This hearing is adjourned. "

[*]GRAHAM: Welcome, everybody. I think we have some Republicans that are at leadership election, but they will be coming in. Can you see me? Can you hear me? Is it working? 
Well, the election is over. They are still counting the votes and making legal challenges, and once all of the legal challenges are made, and the votes are counted, we will have that done. We have still got two outstanding races in Georgia to determine the control of the Senate, and the committee will keep moving forward doing its work. 
We have next week social media oversight. I can't wait to have the social media CEOs come to the committee and explain themselves about their platforms, so that is November 17, and I think there's a lot of bipartisan support to take a hard look at social media plan forms. The EARN IT Act is still business pending before the committee, and after the hearing, we--we will have a markup, but today we have Mr. McCabe, who is the number two at the FBI during Crossfire Hurricane. I think he's going to appear remotely, so I appreciate him coming and what I will do is make a brief opening statement. 
Crossfire Hurricane has been looked at in many fashions the Inspector General's report found 17 policy violations regarding the way the Crossfire Hurricane operation was performed, the FISA court basically rebuked the FBI and the Department of Justice regarding the warrant application made against Carter Page. 
Every person that we have talked to, been able to get a hold of has said if I knew then what I know now would not have signed the Carter Page warrant application. We will take that topic up with Mr. McCabe and counterintelligence investigations of political people the committee needs to look long and hard at creating some new rules of the road. 
This won't be the last time foreign governments try to interfere in our election, and the Russians did, for sure, try to interfere in the 2016 election. We will see what happened in 2020, but also, you have got to make sure that those involved in investigating campaigns have an even hand about it than that whatever biases they have don't seep into the system so that one candidate gets treated differently than the other and we are going to talk about that today with Mr. McCabe. 
That every allegation of a campaign being involved with foreign entities or trying to create an impression of involvement before and entities needs to be looked at not just one side of the ledger, and I look forward to asking Mr. McCabe did--did the FBI live up to that when it came to Crossfire Hurricane and try to find out how the system got so off the rails when it came to Mr. Page and the warrant application. So with that, I will turn it over to Senator Feinstein. 
FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your comments on the election. I think we all should be heartened by the record participation and the dedication of our poll workers and state election officials and certainly on this side of the aisle, and I hope on the other side too in the results. 
So we thank you for calling this hearing; it's part of your examination of Crossfire Hurricane, and that is the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Special Counsel Mueller took control of that investigation when he was appointed in 2017. He concluded that there was foreign interference in the 2016 election. He found that Russia interfered quote in sweeping and systematic fashion end quote. He also uncovered numerous contacts between members of the Trump campaign and individuals linked to Russia, and he determined that the campaign knew about, welcomed, and quote expected it would benefit electorally end quote from Russia's interference. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee on which I said it confirmed what Mueller's findings in a bipartisan report. The report details Russia's 2016 interference and how Trump campaign members were involved. That includes Campaign Manager Paul Manafort whose ties to Russia made him, in the committee's words, quote a grave counterintelligence threat. These investigations make clear that the FBI was right to investigate Russian election interference and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. 
Inspector General Michael Horowitz also confirmed that the FBI was right to investigate. After a two-year investigation, he concluded that the FBI was justified in opening Crossfire Hurricane and that there was no evidence that the political bias impacted the Bureau's work. None of the 14 witnesses the committee has heard from during the chairman's investigation have provided evidence to the contrary. So, where are we? 
More than four years have passed since the FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane, and multiple investigations have confirmed that the FBI was correct to do so, so I think Mr. Chairman, it's time to turn the page on Crossfire Hurricane. I am grateful to FBI Director Wray and the career men and women of the FBI who worked hard to secure our country and its elections they include FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who I look forward to hearing from today. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein. Is Mr. McCabe--are you with us? 
MCCABE: I am. Can you hear me, senator? 
GRAHAM: Mr. McCabe? 
MCCABE: Hello? Senator, can you hear me? 
GRAHAM: Could you speak up, please, sir? 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. Can you hear me now? 
GRAHAM: No. Sorry, we are not getting any sound. Bear with us, Mr. McCabe. We will see if we can fix this. 
MCCABE: Hello. Can you hear me now? 
GRAHAM: Yes, thank you very much. Very much. Loud and clear, please. Could you raise your right hand? Raise your right hand. 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. 
GRAHAM: Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give this committee is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you, God? 
MCCABE: I do. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, Mr. McCabe. Would you like to say anything? Would you or are you just-- 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. I have an opening statement that I would like to read. 
GRAHAM: Please go ahead. 
MCCABE: Okay. Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Feinstein, and distinguished members of the committee thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today. I had the privilege to serve as an FBI agent for over 21 years, from my first assignment working Russian organized crime in New York City to the last years I spent as deputy director at FBI Headquarters. 
I worked with the greatest people on earth, men and women who have dedicated their lives protecting the country as agents, analysts, and professional staff members of the FBI. I know FBI people as hard-working, dedicated patriots who are committed to the rule of law above all else. 
The jobs are hard, sometimes dangerous, and often they are pushed beyond the limits of their experience into volatile, unpredictable situations. FBI personnel are not perfect, but when they make mistakes, they submit to the rigors of oversight and remain committed to learning and getting it right the next time. I was honored to be one of them. I was honored to lead them, and I am honored to discuss our work today. 
I have agreed to testify today about my knowledge of events related to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General report entitled review of four FISA applications and other aspects of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Because I was not permitted to consult the documents that may have refreshed my memory to include my personal notes and my calendar, I may not be as precise and accurate as I otherwise would be. 
I appreciate the committee's flexibility in conducting this hearing virtually rather than in person. While I continue to believe an in-person appearances, a better vehicle for a fair and vigorous oversight hearing the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic compels me to be extremely cautious about where I go and what I do. My wife is a front-line first responder who takes care of children and their families in our local emergency room. I try to avoid unnecessary chances of potential exposure that might put her at risk and possibly endanger her ability to continue caring for our community. 
In July 2016, the FBI initiated an investigation codenamed Crossfire Hurricane to determine whether an individual or individuals from the Trump presidential campaign might be coordinating with the Russian government to interfere with our 2016 presidential election. The concerns that led to our initiation of this case are well known. 
In the fall of 2014, the FBI had begun tracking cyber actors affiliated with Russia who were targeting U.S. political institutions, academic think tanks, and other entities. In the spring of 2016, activity intensified as new Russian cyber actors invaded computer networks at the Democratic National Committee. At the time, we did not know what they plan to do with the information they were stealing from the DNC, but soon we found out. 
In July 2016, Russian intelligence agents acting through the online alias Guccifer 2.0 published hundreds of thousands of emails and other information stolen from the DNC with the intent of damaging Hillary Clinton on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. This malicious use of stolen information signaled a new level of hostility directed at the heart of American democracy. 
Several months before this release and unknown to the FBI at that time, a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign George Papadopoulos informed a diplomat from a friendly foreign government that the Trump campaign had quote received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton closed quote. It was only after the DNC information was publicly released in July that the diplomat communicated the content of his conversation with Papadopoulos to the United States government. 
So what did we know in July 2016? Well, we had known for almost two years that the Russians were targeting our political institutions in cyberspace. By the spring of 2016, we knew the Russians had stolen information from the DNC. By July, we knew the Russians had used that information in a manner designed to hurt Hillary Clinton's chances in the election, and then we learned that before the Russians attacked us, an individual from the Trump campaign may have known the attack was coming. 
FBI policy sets the threshold for opening a full field investigation as the moment when you have information or articulable facts that indicate a threat to national security might exist or that a federal crime might have been committed. In July of 2016, we had both. Russian intelligence services attacking our democratic process, possibly in coordination with the presidential campaign. We opened a case to investigate and try to mitigate that threat and to find out what the Russians might have done. 
Let me be very clear. We did not open a case because we liked one candidate or didn't like the other one. We did not open a case because we intended to stage a coup or overthrow the government. We did not open a case because we thought it might be interesting or because we wanted to drag the FBI into a heated political contest. We opened a case to find out how the Russians might be undermining our election. We opened a case because it was our obligation and our duty to do so. We did our job. 
The OIG's review of four FISA applications and other aspects of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation details a significant number of errors and failures related to the FISA applications in this case. I agreed to be interviewed in connection with the IG's investigation, and I have reviewed the report. 
I was shocked and disappointed at the errors and mistakes that the OIG found. To me, any material misrepresentation or error in a FISA application is unacceptable period. The FBI should be held to the standard of scrupulous accuracy that the court demands. FISA remains one of the most important tools in our country's efforts to protect national security. The FBI is the custodian of that tool. 
I fully support every effort to ensure the FBI's use of FISA maintains the high standards that the court and the American people demand and deserve. This commitment to the rule of law, acknowledging our mistakes, and doing everything possible to ensure that they are corrected these are the reasons I am here today. They are the same reasons I have cooperated fully with every interview, hearing, and oversight effort requested of me both while I served, and since I have left the FBI. 
I have provided testimony to four different congressional committees on these and related matters. I have been interviewed in connection with the Special Counsel's investigation as well as three separate DOJ-OIG investigations submitting to questioning and reviewing documents over the equivalent of seven full business days. In an effort to provide this committee with the most complete accurate testimony possible I requested the FBI allow me to review some of my former materials, including my calendars and personal notes. That request was denied. 
Fortunately, the broad scope of these matters and the passage of time makes many of the details of our work hard to remember. I will do my best to answer your questions today, but I will not speculate or guess about details and facts that now remain beyond my reach without the benefit of refreshing my recollection. 
Based on the recent testimony of the current FBI director and other intelligence officials, it seems that many of the same signs of malevolent Russian targeting that concerned us in 2016 were seen in the run-up to the election we just completed. As both a former career law enforcement officer and a senior intelligence officer-- 
GRAHAM: Mr. McCabe, you had a five-minute opening statement. We are at eight minutes and 40 seconds. Could you please wrap up? 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. I cannot stress enough the importance of focusing your efforts and the attention of this nation on the dangers of foreign influence on our election. The Russians were successful beyond their wildest imagination in accomplishing their goals in 2016. Their successes serve as an encouragement to other hostile nations intent on undermining our security, safety, and stability. The Russians and others will be back. 
Please do not let the recent calm of the 2020 election lore the nation into a false sense of security. It is up to you to ensure the nation recognizes the magnitude of the threat posed by foreign actors and takes sufficiently aggressive steps to address it. With that, I am happy to take your questions. 
GRAHAM: For the record, before I begin my questioning, one of the reasons that he is not able to review his notes is that the FBI did not want him to have access to classified information. I promised Mr. McCabe we would not go into the details of his dismissal, but I don't want anybody to have the belief that this committee chose for him not to have access. It was his former employer who made that decision. 
Now very quickly, did anyone from the Trump campaign wind up being prosecuted for colluding with the Russians? 
MCCABE: Senator, it's my understanding the results of the Mueller investigation that no one was prosecuted for criminal conspiracy involving activity with the Russians. 
GRAHAM: That would include Mr. Papadopoulos, is that correct? 
MCCABE: Mr. Papadopoulos, to the best of my recollection, he was prosecuted for making false statements to FBI agents. 
GRAHAM: Right. Thank you. All right. Let's make sure that the FBI treated both sides fairly. Senator Feinstein suggested it was right to open up the investigation against the Trump campaign. You say it was right; it was your duty. Let's look at the entire record of the 2016 election and see how evenhanded the FBI was. 
On September 7, 2016, the CIA now not the Australian Ambassador of the United Kingdom in London but our CIA sends an investigative lead over to the FBI, and they inform the FBI of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail service. How many agents were assigned to investigate that? 
MCCABE: Senator, if you are referring to the memorandum--the raw intelligence memorandum recently declassified by the DNI-- 
GRAHAM: Yeah, yeah. 
MCCABE: I have read that memorandum, and I--I--I don't understand it to be a request for investigative activity. I'm not aware that any agents were assigned to investigate the information (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Timeout--timeout. You get--you get a memo an investigative lead is what the CIA calls it alleging that Hillary Clinton had just signed off on a plan to tie Trump to Russia for political purposes. How many people looked at that? How many agents were assigned to see if it was true or not? Did you know about it? Did you know about it? 
MCCABE: I was not aware of that memorandum until-- 
GRAHAM: Wait a minute. Timeout. Timeout. Timeout. You get a CIA memo investigative lead memo suggesting that the Democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton is trying to divert attention from her email server problem by casting aspersions against the Trump campaign being connected to Russia, and you didn't know about it. How is that possible? 
MCCABE: Senator, I would like to explain to you how that is possible-- 
GRAHAM: Who did it go to? Who did it go to? I will--I will. I just want to make sure if he understands who it went to. Who did the memo go to? 
MCCABE: I recently--I read the memo recently, to my understanding, it went to Director Comey and was also to the attention of Peter Strzok. That memorandum that you are referring to as I read it is in response to an FBI request, oral request for an update of the sort of information that the Crossfire Hurricane Task Force was reviewing about Russian activity in the campaign. That's from my best recollection that's what (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: I am here--I am here to tell you that that is not--what happened is that the CIA and we have got the documents, sent to the FBI information suggesting that Hillary Clinton had approved of a plan to link Donald Trump to Russia for political purposes and it went to Peter Strzok. Do you believe Peter Strzok was fair-minded when it came to the Trump campaign? 
MCCABE: Senator, my experiences working with Peter Strzok, yes, I believe he was fair in the decisions that he may and the work that he did. 
GRAHAM: So do you object to Mueller relieving him from the investigation because of the emails show that he hated Trump's guts? 
MCCABE: My recollections stirs that we removed Peter from that team because of the ongoing investigation into his-- 
GRAHAM: Did you remove him, or did Mueller remove him? 
MCCABE: We had conversations on the evening that I was first shown the text messages between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page, and we made the decision to remove him and reached out to Director (INAUDIBLE) team, and they were agreed with that, that is my recollection. 
GRAHAM: So you believe that Peter Strzok was on the up and up. Were you ever--was it ever suggested to you by Mr. Priestap that Mr. Strzok should not be involved in this investigation because of his relationship with Lisa Page? 
MCCABE: Senator, I remember discussing with both Mr. Priestap and Mr. Steinbach probably in-- 
GRAHAM: Here are--here are the facts. Priestap suggests that Strzok not be involved; you overrode him, and here's what we know about Strzok and Page. Page, March 3, 2016, God, Trump is a loathsome human. Oh my God Strzok, Trump is an idiot, he is awful. Strzok, God, Hillary should win 100 million to nothing. August 2016 Page, he is not ever going to become President, right? Strzok, no, no, he won't. We will stop it. So is it your testimony under oath that you think Peter Strzok had no biases against Trump? 
MCCABE: Senator, it is my testimony under oath that the work that I saw Peter Strzok do on the Crossfire case and on other cases did not indicate any-- 
GRAHAM: Go ahead. 
MCCABE: Senator, I am having a hard time finishing an answer. I don't know if-- 
GRAHAM: Please, please finish. 
MCCABE: --it's the connection or what but-- 
GRAHAM: Please finish. 
MCCABE: So I was simply stating that the work I saw Peter do on this case and other cases from that work and the decisions he made, I did not see any indications of political bias. 
GRAHAM: Did you--how do you explain to the American people that when the FBI received a memo from the CIA alleging that Hillary Clinton had signed off on a plan concerning U.S. presidential Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail service that you did nothing? Should Peter Strzok have told you about this? 
MCCABE: I can explain to you Senator what Peter Strzok or Director Comey thought about that memo at that time. 
GRAHAM: Should you have been notified-- 
MCCABE: But I can--what I can say Senator is that-- 
GRAHAM: Wait a minute--now wait a minute. Please, please, I want to get into this. Everybody is saying that you had the right to open up an investigation against Trump based on the U.S. ambassador the--excuse me, the Australian Ambassador to the United Kingdom who heard a conversation at a bar. What you are telling this committee when the CIA informs the FBI about a plan signed off by Hillary Clinton to link Trump to Russia nothing was done, is that what you are saying, there was no investigation of that allegation at all? 
MCCABE: What I am saying, sir--senator, is it is not clear to me that there is an allegation of criminal conduct in that memorandum. That is based on my current reading of it. I did not see it at the time. I can't tell you what others thought. 
GRAHAM: It is not--a counterintelligence investigation is what was opened up against Trump, not a criminal investigation is that true? Papadopoulos was a counterintelligence investigation. 
MCCABE: The case against Mr. Papadopoulos was a counterintelligence case that is correct. 
GRAHAM: So if you are going to have a counterintelligence investigation opened up against the Trump campaign based on a conversation by the Australian Ambassador to the United Kingdom-based on a bar conversation, you are telling me that's legit, and you put all of the resources for two and a half years to run that down, but you are telling this committee when our own CIA suggests that Hillary Clinton signed off on a plan to link Trump to Russia for political purposes you didn't do a damn thing is that your testimony? 
MCCABE: No, sir, that is not my testimony. 
GRAHAM: Well, what happened? 
MCCABE: My testimony--I am happy to explain to you how we thought about the issue with Mr. Papadopoulos. 
GRAHAM: No, that's not my question, no. My question is, why did the FBI not open up an investigation based on the CIA input. The CIA is telling the FBI that they have information Hillary Clinton signed off a plan to deflect attention for her and put Trump in a bad light regarding Russia, that came in September 2016. You didn't know about it, apparently. Can you explain to this committee and to the American people why the FBI did nothing regarding that allegation? 
MCCABE: I cannot, sir, explain to you what Peter Strzok or anyone else thought about that at the time, but I can explain to you that the information in that memo-- 
GRAHAM: I--I--I accept that you believe that Mr. Papadopoulos should be looked at; I am not arguing with you. I don't understand how you can tell--how the FBI operated. You have got a tip from an Australian Ambassador to the United Kingdom talking about a bar conversation with Mr. Papadopoulos about Russia hacking, and that leads to two and a half years of turning the country upside down. 
Your own CIA informs the FBI in September that they have information that Hillary Clinton herself signed off on a plan divert attention from her email problems to Trump by linking him to Russia for political purposes, and Mr. Strzok never told you about it; the FBI never opened up an investigation, they never hired one agent. That really is disturbing to a lot of us. 
Now let's go to the warrant. In June 2016, excuse me 2017 did you sign off on the Carter Page warrant application? 
MCCABE: In June 2016, yes. 
GRAHAM: '17, I am sorry. 
MCCABE: '17, I am sorry--2017. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Okay. Did you know at the time that the CIA warned the FBI on numerous occasions to be careful of using the dossier, it was Internet rumor? 
MCCABE: I did not know that at the time, and I don't know that now. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Well, we got a list of let's see a list of CIA informs the FBI that Carter Page had approved--had been approved as an operational contact from 2008 to 2013. Did you know that the CIA had told the FBI that in August 2017? 
MCCABE: No, sir. 
GRAHAM: The reason that is important that would explain why Mr. Page was actually talking to people he claimed to be talking with. 
Did you know--did you have a conversation with Mr. Ohr about the reliability of Christopher Steele? 
MCCABE: I had a conversation in October 2016 about--with Mr. Ohr about his interactions with Mr. Steele. 
GRAHAM: Did he tell you--you should be concerned and be careful? 
MCCABE: I don't remember him saying I should be concerned or be careful, no. 
GRAHAM: In the fall of 2016, this is his testimony to the committee, you put Mr. McCabe on notice hey, you need to watch this, you need to verify? I certainly gave him the same caveats, and the caveats were that Steele hated Trump. Yes, your concerns? Yes. What did--what did he say when you told him that you were concerned about you need to be careful, for lack of a better term? I think he understood because he also worked on Russia criminal matters. So we have Mr. Ohr under oath saying that he expressed concerns to you, Strzok, and others about the reliability of Mr. Steele. You don't remember that? 
MCCABE: Senator, I don't remember the specifics of our conversation; however, we were engaged in trying to determine and verify the statements in Mr. Steele's reporting at that time, so we were certainly concerned about those things. 
GRAHAM: Were you--were you aware of the sub source interview in January and March to the FBI? 
MCCABE: I was aware that an individual who our team thought of as one of the primary sub-sources had been identified and that they were interviewed. 
GRAHAM: Did they tell you about the substance of those interviews? 
MCCABE: Not in detail. 
GRAHAM: So you didn't know that in January, the sub source tells the FBI he had no idea where some of the language attributed to him came from? His contacts never mentioned some of the information attributed to them? He said he did not know the origins of other information that was supposedly from his contacts, he did not recall other information attributed to him or his contacts, Steele used incorrect source characterizations for the primary sub-source's contacts, that in March he said he never expected Steele to put his statements in reports or present them as facts, the statements were word of mouth, and hearsay conversations had by friends over beers or statements made in jest that should be taken with a grain of salt. Was any of that ever communicated to you? 
MCCABE: No, sir, not that I can recall. 
GRAHAM: If you knew then what you know now, would you have signed the warrant application in June 2017 against Carter Page? 
MCCABE: No, sir. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Finally, who is responsible for ruining Mr. Carter Page's life? If it's not you, if it's not Rosenstein, if it's not Comey if it's not Sally Yates who is responsible for putting together the information provided to the FISA court that was completely devoid of the truth, lacking material facts, completely represented what Mr. Page did and how he did it? Who should we look to for that responsibility? 
MCCABE: Well, sir, I--I don't know agree with the way that you have characterized the entirety-- 
GRAHAM: That is what the court said. 
MCCABE: I think, as the IG pointed out in the conclusions of their report-- 
GRAHAM: Who is responsible, Mr. McCabe? 
MCCABE: Everyone who had--every person who played a role-- 
GRAHAM: Everybody is responsible, but nobody is responsible? 
MCCABE: Sir if it would help if you would allow me to finish my answer. I think it might be easier to understand. 
GRAHAM: Okay. The question is who is responsible. 
MCCABE: And I think that we are all responsible for the work that went into that FISA. I am certainly responsible as a person in a leadership position with oversight over these matters, I accept that responsibility fully. 
GRAHAM: Did you mislead--did you mislead the FISA court? 
MCCABE: I signed a package that included in--numerous factual errors or failed to include information that should have been brought to the court-- 
GRAHAM: And what should be done--what should be done to you and others? 
MCCABE: Well, senator, I think we are--we are doing that with this process. I think our efforts should be focused on figuring out how these errors took place and ensuring that they don't happen again. 
GRAHAM: That starts with those who committed the problem being held accountable. Senator Feinstein? 
FEINSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chairman, I hope you know this is difficult forces one hearings open and then they get opened, and reports get done, and then they get castigated for doing it and in his 434-Page report IG Horowitz confirmed that the FBI had a legitimate reason to open the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. 
Attorney General Barr disagreed with the IG finding and has since referred to it as the bogus Russia-gate scandal. So this is the first time I have heard of this kind of thing happening and one witness told the IG that quote, it would have been a dereliction of duty and responsibility of the highest order not to investigate. Do you agree with that? 
MCCABE: I'm sorry, senator I--I absolutely agree that it would have been a dereliction of duty for us to not initiate the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in the way that we did. 
FEINSTEIN: Now, as I understand it, it was a counterintelligence investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia. You opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump himself after he fired former FBI Director Comey and linked Comey's termination to the Russia investigation. I don't know whether that's true or not; I would like to know. 
You have said that if the FBI failed to open an investigation into Trump, under those circumstances, we wouldn't be doing our job. I believe you said that on 60 Minutes, so I think it's pretty clear opening a counterintelligence investigation into a president is an extraordinary step. Why did you see it as necessary under those circumstances? 
MCCABE: Senator, there were a lot of things that were concerning us as we went through the opening and the process of investigating-- 
FEINSTEIN: Well, please say what they were. I think it would be helpful to this conversation. 
MCCABE: Sure. So we knew that the Russians had been targeting us, we had reason to believe because of the friendly foreign government information that the campaign had been aware of that and might have coordinated with them in those activities, so that is why we initiated the Crossfire investigation. 
After as we proceeded with that investigation we had a series of alarming enter--I should say Director Comey had a series of alarming interactions with President Trump in which it became pretty clear to us that he did not want us to continue investigating what the Russians had done, he actually asked at one point that we stop investigating General Flynn, he then fired Director Comey when we--he also asked that we state publicly that he was not under investigation. 
When we didn't do that, and we did enclose the investigation on General Flynn, he fired Director Comey. He then stated publicly that he was--he had fired Director Comey thinking about the Russians. He then told the Russians that he had fired Director Comey and that that had relieved a lot of pressure that had been on him. So we had many reasons at that point to believe that the president might himself pose a danger to national security and that he might have engaged in obstruction of justice if the firing of the director and those other things were geared towards eliminating or stopping our investigation of Russian activity. 
FEINSTEIN: So what was found on that point? 
MCCABE: Well, that's the point senator in which we handed the investigation on the first four people and the investigation of President Trump and the investigation of former Attorney General Sessions over to the Special Counsel team, and I think you know we all know what happened the conclusion of that investigation, the details that are provided in the Mueller report I think provide pretty solid results that verify that our concerns were valid. So I am very confident in the work that the Special Counsel did and I think it proved that our concerns at that time were legitimate. 
FEINSTEIN: Would you go into some of those concerns and what the report showed? 
MCCABE: Sure. So we opened the initial Crossfire Hurricane investigation because predominantly the statements of George Papadopoulos, which indicated that people maybe Mr. Papadopoulos, maybe others affiliated with the campaign might be coordinating with Russia. In my--my recollection of the results of the Special Counsel's investigation is that they found I think it was over 100 different connections between people affiliated with or a part of the Trump campaign and Russians or people affiliated with the Russian government or Russian intelligence services. So clearly, our concern that there might be connections here that we should be looking into to ensure there is no danger to national security was proven true. 
On the obstruction of justice side, I think as is well-known Director Mueller concluded that he could not indict or seek an indictment of a sitting president due to Department of Justice policy; however, volume 2 of the Mueller report lays out in pretty excruciating detail at least ten different categories of behavior or activity that the president engaged in, and I think to the best of my recollection in at least eight of those categories the elements of the offense of obstruction of justice evidence to prove each element of the offense of obstruction of justice are present in those categories of behavior. 
So it's a fairly--it's a bit legalistic, and I apologize for that explanation, but it is a fairly compelling case that the President was, in fact, engaging in behavior that you could easily categorize as obstruction of justice, so once again are concerned that the president might be obstructing justice was verified by the results of the Mueller report. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Senator Cornyn? 
CORNYN: Mr. McCabe, I revere the Department of Justice, I revere the FBI, but what has happened over the last four years has revealed an FBI gone rogue that has interfered with not just one candidate but with two candidates for president of the United States starting with Hillary Clinton and then, of course, the investigation of the current President Donald Trump. How is it that the FBI decided to interfere in the election of not just one but two candidates for president of the United States? 
MCCABE: Well, senator, I--I don't agree with your characterization of our work as having gone rogue, and I would also say that at no time while I was in the FBI did we make a decision to interfere in any presidential election. 
CORNYN: Did you--did you participate in the discussions leading up to the July 5, 2016, press conference that Director Comey held on the email investigation? Did you agree with that, and did you support his decision to go public with that announcement? 
MCCABE: Senator, I--I was a part of those decisions at the time I supported it, at the time. I feel very differently about it now. I'm happy to go into detail about that if you would like. 
CORNYN: And you understand that while you thought that firing the FBI director may be some evidence of Russian involvement with President Trump, you are familiar with the Rod Rosenstein memo, which was at least in part the reason why Director Comey was fired, correct? 
MCCABE: I learned of the--yes--yes. I became familiar with that maybe the day that Director Comey was fired. 
CORNYN: What I don't understand, Mr. McCabe, is your relationship with Director Comey. Did Director Comey know everything you know, or did you selectively tell him or report to him about things that the FBI was doing? 
MCCABE: Well, I can't say, senator I--I can't say what Director Comey knew, but I can tell you that Director Comey and I attended numerous meetings together, briefings every day, that it was my practice to discuss all of the major issues that we were dealing with, that I was dealing with--with Director Comey so we--we spoke frequently about you know most topics I can't tell you with perfect accuracy everything that we talked about but we--we talked a lot, so he was pretty up to speed on what was going on at all times. 
CORNYN: Did you or Director Comey consult with Attorney General Lynch or Deputy Attorney Sally Yates about the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign? 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. Our team met with the folks, the DOJ leadership of the national security division within a day or so of opening the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and informed them of what we had done and what we thought about the case and the people who were being investigated and then Director Comey and I--well--I won't speak for Director Comey I had follow-up conversations with department leadership in the days that followed and many times during the course of the investigation. 
CORNYN: Mr. McCabe, who should be held accountable for the submission of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application that contained a lie about Carter Page with regard to his activities on behalf of another agency of the federal government and who should be held accountable for relying on the now-discredited Steele dossier? I think that's the question people would like an answer to. Who should be held accountable? 
MCCABE: Senator, I think all of the people involved in this work should be and have been held accountable. I feel like the oversight process that we are engaged in now, the participation and cooperation in the efforts of the inspector general, I think all of these elements are the work that the FBI has done internally to address everything from individuals to processes involved, I think those are all essential steps to ensure that this--these errors are fixed and that we take appropriate steps not to make them in the future. 
CORNYN: Well, it's 2020, and these occurred back in 2016. I don't think the--I certainly don't have any confidence that the people who are responsible for this debacle over the last four years will ultimately be held responsible. I hope I am wrong. So I don't agree with my friend from California that it is now a time to turn the page. We need to make sure that nothing like this ever, ever happens again to any candidate or any president regardless of their political party. 
I have to tell you my biggest concern Mr. McCabe is if the FBI under James Comey and under your leadership as deputy director of the FBI can do this what they did to Hillary Clinton, a candidate for president of the United States, and can do it to Donald J Trump both as a candidate and as the current president of the United States what chance does an average citizen have if they are under investigation by an FBI led by--led by leaders in the fashion that you and Mr. Comey led during the time of these investigations? What confidence can an average citizen have that they would have any chance at all? 
MCCABE: Senator, I--I disagree with you. I think that all Americans should and do have great confidence in the FBI today and during the time I was there and before that. The FBI conducts tens of thousands of investigations across all programs every single day, and the FBI goes to great lengths to ensure that the rights, constitutional rights of those subjects of investigations, the witnesses we come across, and the sources of information we work with are--are protected during the course of those investigations. 
That doesn't mean that we make--we don't make mistakes; we do. We are an organization of human beings, and people make mistakes, and when that happens, I think we go through a rigorous process to ensure that we don't make those mistakes again. 
CORNYN: But when you make--when you make mistakes, other people pay the price apparently. Let me just as one final question, Mr. McCabe. On March 16, you were terminated by the FBI following an investigation of the Office of Inspector General and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, which found that you had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and you lacked candor, including under oath on multiple occasions, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: Senator, it is correct that I was the subject of a bias deeply flawed and unfair investigation by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General, and I have been pretty clear in my vigorous objection to that investigation and its findings and conclusions. I filed a federal lawsuit, and I think I would refer you to the specific comments in that lawsuit. It is not proper for me to discuss the details of that investigation now that it is in front of a federal judge. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Durbin? 
DURBIN: Mr. Chairman, anyone across America tuned into this hearing, has a right to be confused. If you were told this is a hearing on a presidential election, it's true but not the one that occurred a week ago. 
We are talking about a presidential election campaign four years ago. Yes, we are focusing on a presidential election, but we are examining for the fourth time the role of Russians in the 2016 election four years ago, and more importantly, we are discussing President Trump's conclusion despite intelligence evidence to the contrary that the Russian collusion was a hoax. 
For the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is all about Hillary; it is all about outgoing President Trump's bizarre theories of justice. This is a last-ditch desperate undertaking to deal with President Trump's grievances about that election. We have all conceded the point. Carter Page was not treated properly; both sides of the aisle have said as much. How many more times do we need to say it? I want to say it again today because I still believe it. But what are we actually facing here? 
What is the state of play in America today that the Senate Judiciary Committee might be interested in? Well, let's take a few items. We did have an election, a landmark moment in history, a sitting President Donald Trump who has routinely disrespected the rule of law, undermine democratic institutions, put his own interests ahead of the interests of the American people, ignored science and public health when it comes to this pandemic and violated basic standards of honesty and decency in unprecedented numbers a clear majority of Americans voted to say that's it we are finished with you and replace him with President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris sensitively to senators who have served honorably on this committee. 
The election sent a clear message it is time to stop relitigating issues of the last election. It's time finally to put behind us the divisiveness and vitriol of the Trump era and to bring our fractured country together to address COVID-19 number one and put our economy back on its feet, but here we are today, seven days after that election and our committee is holding another partisan hearing to advance President Trump's theories. 
This is the fourth hearing this year on the last administration, the previous administration's Justice Department in response to President Trump's repeated calls to investigate the investigators and to try to rewrite the story of Russia's involvement in the 2016 campaign. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee that we sit on here hasn't held a single oversight hearing on the Trump administration's Justice Department in this Congress. Any issues we might want to raise? I can think of a few. 
Perhaps we might even investigate the Department of Homeland Security and their zero-tolerance policy. I regret what happened to Carter Page, and I said so before, but I also regret what happened to 2200 infants, toddlers, and children who were physically removed from their parents by the zero-tolerance policy of the Trump administration and the fact that 545 of those children still are in an abandoned status today, 545. 
So my question, as has been asked to the witness before us today, is who should be held responsible? Why wouldn't the Senate Judiciary Committee even care to have a hearing? Why wouldn't the Immigration Subcommittee, which I am a ranking member on with the senator from Texas, even have one hearing on that issue? None. 
But this is the fourth hearing we are having going back over this well-plowed ground. There are some timely issues related to the Department of Justice, who we might even have considered today. Let me give you one. 
Yesterday Attorney General Bill Barr issued a memo authorizing federal prosecutors to quote pursue substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities prior to the certification of elections. The attorney general's memo represents another instance of his sacrificing the reputation of the Department of Justice to serve the political interests of President Donald Trump. 
Attorney General Barr is clearly attempting to fabricate a veneer of legitimacy for the baseless claims of voter fraud made by President Trump and his supporters and his doing so by overwriting long-standing Department of Justice policies that were put in place to prevent this very type of political interference in an election season. 
Let me tell you what the previous guidelines, that previous attorney generals honored said quote public knowledge of a criminal investigation could impact the adjudication of election litigation in contest and state courts; accordingly it is the general policy of the Justice Department not to conduct overt investigations end of quote. Attorney General Barr jettisoned that standard yesterday. The Barr memo prompted the Department of Justice Director of Election Crimes Branch to resign from his position an issue the Senate Judiciary Committee might want to be concerned about? 
No, I'm sorry we are back relitigating the 2016 election. We are going to go through that all over again, maybe a fifth time, instead of asking pertinent and relevant questions about what is happening today. 
Mr. Richard Pilger, who resigned from that position, noted that Barr's memo quote abrogated the 40-year-old noninterference policy for ballot fraud allegations in the period prior to elections becoming certified and uncontested end of quote. When General Barr came before me in my office, I asked him point-blank why do you want to be Donald Trump's attorney general? Well, he's said you should have seen the list of other people who were being also considered. I--I thought that I should step in at that point, and secondly, he said I want to preserve the reputation of the Department of Justice. 
Is there anyone on or off this committee who believes that General Barr's actions yesterday preserve the integrity of the Department of Justice where baseless claims are being made about voter fraud? Do you know what the litigants' record is in court since the election? Protesting the outcome of the election? 0-10, they have no evidence whatsoever of election fraud. If they did, they would certainly bring it forward. 
I want to close by thanking former President George W. Bush of Texas for stepping up and doing the honorable thing and acknowledging to now President-elect Joe Biden that he did win, that he will be the next president and he President Bush as a proud Republican thought that it was time for him to step up for the good of the Republic. I yield. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Durbin. I would like to respond to some of the comments you made about the committee, what we are doing, and why. Number one, we are going to investigate how the Carter Page warrant application was submitted numerous times to the FISA court with inaccurate information, and I think it's important to have every person who signed it say if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have signed it; to me it is actually pretty stunning. 
In the committee in September 29 received information for Director Ratcliffe that in September 2016, September 7, the CIA informs the FBI that candidate Hillary Clinton approved of a plan concerning U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russia hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail server and if you go look at the classified information there is more there. And I guess what we are saying is that you accept without any doubt that the FBI should have looked at all things Trump based on Papadopoulos, that it would have been a dereliction of duty not to do so. 
What we are suggesting is that when the CIA informs the FBI that Hillary Clinton may have signed off on a plan to link Trump to Russia for political reasons that nobody did anything, there wasn't an investigation opened, Mr. McCabe didn't even know about it, the FBI director says it didn't ring a bell, the person it went to was Peter Strzok who was incredibly pious against President Trump. 
So I guess what we are saying if you believe it would have been a dereliction of duty not to look at Trump based on a statement by the Australian Ambassador of the United Kingdom regarding a bar conversation in London that led to everything we have dealt with for two and a half years we were wondering just out loud here how could you ignore the CIA information provided to the FBI that the Democratic candidate for president signed off on a plan to link Trump to Russia political reasons which may explain some of the garbage of Crossfire Hurricane? 
Now you are okay with that; we are not. You are absolutely perfectly fine with the fact that the Democratic candidate for president of the United States in 2016 the CIA had information she signed off on a plan to link the Republican candidate to Russia for political purposes and nobody did anything. 
You are absolutely fine with that, we are not, that is a big deal to me because this won't be the last election we will ever have and you can't live in a country this way, you can't live in a country where they take a CIA lead and put it in the garbage can, and nobody do anything, that's just not fair to this country, that's got to stop, you can't have two standards. 
Will you help me make sure Mueller doesn't get fired? Yes. Mueller got to do his job. Well, here is what we are upset about, nobody took allegations from the CIA seriously about Hillary Clinton's effort to sign off on a plan. It may not be true, but somebody should have looked at it, nobody cared over there, and I think most people on this side of the aisle believe that when it came to Clinton and Trump, the FBI and all of the people involved with Crossfire Hurricane shut out anything that would change the narrative that Trump was being involved with the Russians, they ignored every stop sign about Carter Page, they kept ignoring information because they wanted an outcome and they didn't lift a finger to investigate a lead from our own CIA. 
WHITEHOUSE: Mr. Chairman? 
DURBIN: Mr. Chairman, May I respond? 
GRAHAM: Yes, please. 
DURBIN: Mr. Chairman, what you have just said is so alarming that we should have had somewhere along the way a thorough nonpartisan investigation of this whole Crossfire Hurricane. Well, it turns out we did. 
Inspector General Michael Horowitz, in December of 2019, found that FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation was quote open for an authorized purpose, had adequate factual predication, and was not influenced by bias. 
FBI Director Chris Wray--Christopher Wray agreed. That isn't what President Trump or Attorney General Barr or perhaps members of this committee wanted to hear, so they've tried to reopen that independent IG investigation in every partisan way imaginable. And this is the fourth try in this committee. Enough. 
GRAHAM: With all due respect, Senator Durbin, does it not bother you at all that the CIA tells the FBI of a plan that Hillary Clinton may have signed off on and nobody looked at it? 
WHITEHOUSE: May I jump in? 
GRAHAM: Please. 
WHITEHOUSE: Actually, it doesn't. 
GRAHAM: Okay. 
WHITEHOUSE: And I'll tell you why it doesn't. The FBI is an agency of limited and specific jurisdiction. It has the ability to pursue predicated criminal investigations, and I think we've all agreed that a political campaign choosing to tie politically the opponent to a foreign country is not a criminal act. The Trump campaign tried to do that to Joe Biden with China all through this campaign. It's not a criminal act. 
And if you're looking at this as a counterintelligence investigation, the obvious difference is that the information that the FBI was receiving about Carter Page and the Trump campaign is that there were contacts. Contacts between Russian intelligence operatives and Trump campaign operatives. When you have contacts going on, that does light up a flag on a counterintelligence front and I don't see how anybody could disagree that that's the case. 
But when you have a campaign making its internal campaign policy to try to say either well, Biden is too close to China and you can't trust him, or Trump's too close to trust him and you can't trust him, I don't think the FBI has a lot of business interfering in that type of public campaign political debate. And I would bet you that if the FBI was looking into what the Trump campaign said about Biden with respect to China and whether they had a strategy to try to tie Biden to Trump--to Trump, you would be beside yourself with irritation and anger that the FBI had taken that step. 
And yet here, you're excoriating the FBI for staying away from taking that step with respect to an internal political strategy of the Hillary campaign. I don't see how that gets you too either criminality or the type of contacts with a foreign power that raise counterintelligence concerns. So that's why you keep asking this question. There's my answer. 
GRAHAM: Well, let me give you my reply to your answer and we'll get to Senator Lee. In this case, there was no criminal investigation opened. It was all counterintelligence based on a conversation by the Austrian ambassador to the United Kingdom with Papadopoulos and with bar and we got the tapes. And Papadopoulos saw said on tape, no, I'm not working with the Russians. That would be treason. They used that snippet to open up what now is called Crossfire Hurricane and the Mueller investigation. 
I guess what--the one thing you're overlooking here is that the Steele dossier was prepared by Christopher Steele, who was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. He was working through Fusion GPS that was being paid by the Democratic Party and created a document that was a bunch of garbage, at the State Department calls over to the FBI and says this guy wants Trump not to win in the worst way. Bruce Ohr and a bunch of other people warned the FBI that the Christopher Steele document is suspect at best. The CIA informs the FBI that it's Internet rumor. 
So this is a situation where if the Clinton campaign in fact created this impression that Trump was working through--with the Russians through Christopher Steele, who is on the payroll, that yeah, maybe that makes it all makes sense. Maybe that explains that this dossier was prepared by a political person, by a person on the payroll that was used to get a warrant against an American citizen. 
This is the first time I know of that opposition research winds up being used by the FBI to get a warrant against an American citizen, a member of the other campaign. I am very sad that the CIA's information about Hillary Clinton signing off on a plan to link Trump to Russia wasn't looked at because if you'd looked at it, that may have explained Christopher Steele and the dossier. Senator Lee. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. According to Bill Priestap's handwritten notes from January 24th 2017 meeting, a meeting that you, Mr. McCabe attended, the FBI strategy with General Michael Flynn was to ""Get him to lie so we could prosecute him or get him fired"" and also, ""If we can get him to admit to breaking the Logan Act, give the facts to the Department of Justice and have them decide."" Mr. McCabe, is it typical for leadership at the FBI to strategize as to how to get subjects of an investigation to lie, as in this case? In an informal interview without counsel present? 
MCCABE: Well, I can't--I'm not going to speak for Mr. Priestap's notes, but I can tell you-- 
LEE: --No, I'm just asking you whether it's typical. 
MCCABE: I can tell you that it is common to discuss before an interview the many different ways that that interview might turn out. And one of those ways is that the subject or the witness you are interviewing might be deliberately deceptive. And so it is common to think through how you would handle that. 
LEE: Okay. Now, in his 302 interview, Peter Strzok stated, ""Before the interview, McCabe, the FBI, general counsel and others decided agents would not warn Flynn, that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed and they were concerned that giving warnings might adversely affect the report."" Is it normal for FBI leaders leadership to instruct agents to not inform interviewees of their rights in investigational interviews? 
MCCABE: There is no requirement to tell any witness or interviewee that it is a crime to lie to the FBI. It is very common for agents and their supervisors to discuss how they're going to handle these different elements of an interview before they go in and do it. 
LEE: But I assume you don't do that all the time and one of the reasons you don't do that all the time is because you rely on informal interviews. You get a lot of information out of them. And if you were constantly warning them in advance and--and making them feel like their targets, that's a problem. But it also can become a problem and it invariably does when people in an informal interview are lured into an informal interview with one set of expectations that you've created for them and you routinely--them. 
But, when scheduling the January 24th meeting with General Flynn, you threatened to elevate the issue of Flynn's call with Kislyak to the Department of Justice if he appeared at the interview with counsel. Statements made by General Flynn during this very same interview where you advised him to appear also were used as the basis for his prosecution. So is it--is it standard practice for the FBI to threaten high level administration officials if they refuse to appear for interviews without counsel or at least without somebody from the White House counsel's office? 
MCCABE: Well, the premise of your question is--is absolutely false. I did not threaten General Flynn with anything. General Flynn and I, during a very short conversation, I asked General Flynn if he wanted to have representative from the White House Counsel's Office or his own attorney attend the interview and I simply told him that if that were the case that I would need the agents to also bring an attorney from the Department of Justice. General Flynn very quickly replied that he didn't want to bring an attorney to the interview, which is certainly his right and we preceded in that way. 
LEE: Okay. Looking, I'm looking at your note regarding your conversation with General Flynn. ""I explained to Lieutenant General Flynn that my desire was to have two of my agents interviewed most quickly him as quickly, quietly, and discreetly as possible. He agreed and offered to meet with the agents today. We had some discussion about timing and ultimately agreed to conduct the interview at his office in the White House at 14:30 this afternoon. I explained that I thought the quickest way to get this done was to have a conversation between him and the agents only. I've heard it further stated that if General Flynn wished to include anyone else in the meeting like the White House Counsel, for instance, that I would need to involve the Department of Justice. He stated that this would not be necessary and agreed with the agents without any additional participants."" 
That to me, at least carries a certain suggestion. Now, based on--on Sally Yates 302, Director Comey admitted that he would have informed the Obama White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, if this were occurring under analogous circumstances with President Obama and President Obama's national security advisor. So why this disparate treatment? Why would you have one standard where you would inform the chief of staff in one instance what not but not in another administration? 
MCCABE: Well sir, I can't speak for why Jim Comey--what Jim Comey thought about that at the time. I'm not aware of that. 
LEE: Okay. Mr. McCabe, we've hold in a few different people to talk about the Crossfire Hurricane investigation in front of this committee. And so far, we haven't been able to get a single straight answer to some critical questions, including who in leadership at the FBI or at the Department of Justice knew about the serious flaws contained in the Carter Page FISA warrants before the original application was submitted on October 21st, 2016. 
Also, who knew by the time that the first renewal was submitted on January 12, 2017, or how about the second renewal on April 7th, 2017? And most importantly for today's purposes, who knew when you signed the third renewal on June 28th, 2017? Nobody seems to be telling us anything. 
Back in August, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told this committee that she had no idea where critical factual errors in the initial Carter Page application. She had no idea that those were there. A few weeks ago, Director Comey told this committee that he didn't know about the errors when he signed the initial applications and the subsequent renewals. And now, you've told this committee what--what is your answer to these questions? Tell me what you were aware of as of those days. 
MCCABE: Well, I've been pretty clear that I was not aware of the errors that are identified in the IG's report or any other errors that were present in the package that I signed in June of 2017. 
LEE: Mr. Chairman, my time is expiring. Could I get an additional two minutes? I think I can wrap this up in that time. Thank you. Now, you stated in your written testimony that ""FISA remains one of the most important tools in our country's efforts to protect national security. The FBI is the custodian of that tool. I fully support every effort to ensure that the FBI is used to FISA maintains the high standards of the court and the American people that they demand and they reserve--they deserve."" 
Well that's all well and good. I like this statement as far as it goes, but I would note, Mr. McCabe, that I've heard this line before. Not just once. I've heard it more times than I can possibly count over the last 10 years while I've been sitting on this committee. 
In fact, your comments are nearly identical to those that I've heard from FBI official after FBI official from basically every FBI official who's testified in front of this committee on this issue. Trust us. We are the good guys and we need these secret surveillance authorities in order to keep you safe. 
And furthermore, you don't need to worry about them. These aren't the droids you were looking for because we're the good guys and we require at high level of approval. Well, it turns out, Mr. McCabe--McCabe, none of the people involved in the high level approval, those same people have told me over and over again over the last decade that they were reviewing them and that that's why it was okay. None of them could answer these questions. So that's why we're here again. 
So I'm asking you now, how were we supposed to tell the American people to have confidence in the secretive FISA surveillance process if, mind you, this is hard to believe, no one in FBI leadership, no one in leadership of DOJ or FBI wants to admit that they were aware of serious flaws in a very high profile investigation? And what assurances could you possibly give us that FISA applications targeting everyday Americans, just U.S. citizens, not foreign suspected terrorists and not even high-profile government officials in the United States are subject to any stricter scrutiny? They--they simply can't be. 
The fact is the FISA process must be reformed. We can't ask Americans to continue to give the federal government this enormous amount of unsupervised scrutiny and discretion only to have it abused by this and only to have the people who were accountable for it say they have no idea how these things happened. I can assure you that your abuse of the FISA process has cost you the trust of the American people. That in and of itself is tragic and I don't use those words lightly. 
What's even more tragic is that they've caused a great agency, one that I worked with as a--as a federal prosecutor and for which I've had great respect and where there are still countless hardworking, honest men and women who earn the FBI's good name every day, their reputation has been sullied and the bureau's ability to do its job has been seriously impaired by these missteps. That's why this structure must change and I won't rest until it does. 
GRAHAM: Mr. McCabe, would you like to respond too? 
MCCABE: Sure. So I certainly can't respond to things that other people have said to Senator Lee over the last 10 years. I do agree with you that this process, the IG's oversight, the report that they delivered has uncovered that there are problems with the way--potentially with the way that the FBI is handling its FISA responsibilities. I think I'm fairly confident in saying that this experience has exposed to me at least that we have been overconfident in the process that we've been using for years. 
We've been overconfident in that--any oversight that we've been subjecting each finds a package to. And I think that we need to go back in very, you know, thoroughly look at how do we change that process to ensure that the errors and the omissions in these packages that we now know about don't happen again? I agree with you in that respect, Senator. 
LEE: It won't change. We have to change it. It's the law that's the problem. It gives an unfair amount of discretion to human beings who have proven time and again they can't be trusted with it. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Senator Whitehouse. 
WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, chairman. First of all, let me just say that given the errors and omissions that everybody concedes and knows were in the FISA warrant, no official would say now that they'd sign that warrant knowing that it had errors and omissions. So that's an obvious question. 
What I want to make sure of is that it doesn't lead to the wrong implication that because officials wouldn't sign a warrant that they knew to have errors and omissions in it that, had they found out that there were errors and omissions and that they would have ended it ended the investigation. That is not a logical belief. That is not a correct assertion or a correct implication. 
What you do is you go back and you clear out the errors and omissions. You take whatever personnel action is necessary against the people responsible for those errors and omissions and then you proceed with your case with a correct warrant. So let's just make sure that that is clear. I think we agree on that, but I want to clarify that. 
I also have got to say I've got no objection to us pursuing endlessly the question of this Crossfire Hurricane investigation, but it does hurt me that we do this at the expense of other things we could be looking at and should be looking at. If you haven't read Judge Gleeson's brief for a federal judge in the Flynn case, it's one of the most astonishing piece--first of all, it's just an amazingly good piece of legal writing, so if you are a law student out there or a young lawyer, read it just to watch the skill of a terrific it advocate at work. 
But the allegations and concerns that a retired federal judge on behalf of a sitting federal judge has made about the Department of Justice or unprecedented. And what attention have we given that? None. There is, very likely, mischief behind the antitrust letter that was sent out to auto companies who had the nerve to try to interfere with the fossil fuel industry's scheme to undo vehicle emission standards. There's no support for that. It's since been withdrawn. The hearing continues to be postponed and I still have gotten 0--0 evidence or information in relation to my requests about that. 
We have what appears to have been a tanked FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh hearings and I've asked questions about that to which I've had no answer whatsoever. We've had multiple resignations and protests by career DOJ officials under Attorney General Barr and we can't get any answers to what's going on behind those resignations in protest. And now, two federal courts have written official opinions, decisions excoriating the work of the Office of Legal Counsel and nothing on that. 
So we are highly selective in what we choose to look into and we've been extremely solicitous of the stonewalling and non-responsiveness of this Department of Justice. Well guys, we're about to go into a Biden Department of Justice. And if the standard you want to set is that the Department of Justice doesn't have to answer any letters, doesn't have to answer any QFRs, only does things for the majority party, congratulations because you've done a really good job of setting that precedent in this committee. 
You have allowed an effective policy at the Department of Justice and the FBI of non-responsiveness. And I'll tell you how bad it is. The chairman actually brought the deputy attorney general into a meeting with me, thank you for that courtesy, at my request because we were getting no answers to QFRs, no answers to letters. Just a complete blow off. 
If I recall correctly that meeting was in June. Do you know how many answers I've gotten since June? After that meeting with the deputy attorney general about unanswered questions? None. 0. So you all have set one heck of a precedent if you think you're going to come back with questions about the Biden Department of Justice. You have set a precedent that the Department of Justice and the FBI don't have to answer our questions and that if you're in the majority, that's cool. You're just going to let that ride. 
So I have to take this opportunity to ask some back questions to a former FBI official because we don't have that. So let me ask Mr. McCabe or their--the FBI does pretty much everything by policy and procedure in my recollection as a U.S. attorney working with FBI agents. Were there FBI policies and procedures related to how a tip line operates? 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. Yeah, there are policies about that. 
WHITEHOUSE: And where would I go to find those policies and procedures? I was able to find one statement on the Internet. Are you aware of other places that we should go to look more specifically, since we haven't been able to get straight answers? 
MCCABE: I don't know if I can give you the perfect place to look, but the tip line, way FBI handles tip lines changed a lot in the last five or so years. So they are all managed centrally out of our facility in West Virginia that kind of handles all the incoming calls and then sends leads or information, you know, directed to the fuel officers that would be responsible for following up on those things. So it's-- 
WHITEHOUSE: --Who has authority to--who has authority to set one up? Who makes the call? And agency? If I want a tip line-- 
MCCABE: --I'm sorry, sir-- 
WHITEHOUSE: --Where--how does that--where does that decision travel through the FBI? You don't get a tip line in every case. You get tip lines in some cases. Why how does that work? 
MCCABE: Typically the office of public affairs would be involved in that--in that suggestion in that kind of hey, this--if it's a particular case that we think requesting that public's active involvement will help that's-- 
WHITEHOUSE: --So the agent would ask his agent in charge and the agent in charge would clear it with the Public Affairs Office and then the process for a tip line kicks in? 
MCCABE: That's--that's the best of my recollections. 
WHITEHOUSE: Okay. And then, once the tip line is up and running and information starts to come in, what does it look like when you're going through those tips? Obviously, a lot of them are just going to be just nutty people calling in. Some of them are going to have very significant evidence, potentially in them and you're going to have to go and dig into that. Who overseas that to make sure that that is legitimate and that evidence is actually being dug out of a tip line call? 
MCCABE: So those calls, once the line is set up, those calls would go into our Criminal Justice Information Services division in West Virginia and the telephone--the operators, the specialists who answered those calls have a process for how they memorialize the information that comes off that tip and who it gets sent to and whether it should be brought to someone's attention immediately if it's something that involves possibly a threat to life. So there are--there are kind of detailed policies around that. I'm not really in a position to be able to tell you great detail about them off the top of my head. 
WHITEHOUSE: Okay. I'm over my time, so let me ask a last very short question, and that is if an FBI tip line were set up and information were collected through that FBI tip line and then nobody looked at what had been brought in, it was just all dumped in the file and there was no further investigative work at all, would that be consistent with FBI policy or procedure? 
MCCABE: From the way you've described the situation, sir, I'd have to say no. I'm not aware of a specific situation that fits that model, but presumably, the information that comes in off the tip line gets put into our guardian system and that's how all of our incoming tip information is managed and assigned and investigated at its most kind of initial level. So no. Information that comes into the FBI should never just be put aside and not followed up on. 
WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, chairman, for the extra time. 
GRAHAM: Absolutely. And as to the antitrust issue you've been talking about, the committee deserves to have a hearing on that. We had the Barrett nomination, so I want to get with Senator Lee and to make sure that we can, in a reasonable fashion, get answers to the questions you've raised. I think we owe that to not only you, but the committee itself. 
WHITEHOUSE: Hearings can be pretty meaningless if we haven't been given any documents-- 
GRAHAM: --Yeah. No, I-- 
WHITEHOUSE: --If you've been blown off by the FBI time and again. 
GRAHAM: We've got some time left and we will look into that as to Justice Kavanaugh. I think he got a, from my point of view, a pretty good scrutiny. So Senator Tillis. No, who have we got? Grassley. I overlooked the soon to be chairman. 
GRASSLEY: During the course of Crossfire Hurricane, the Obama administration used FISA process as a weapon against candidate Trump and then later President Trump. Doing so undermined his presidency from the start. 
We voted in the Senate on legislation that would repair many of the shortcomings in the current FISA court system striking a balance of increasing accountability, transparency, and ensuring fairness while protecting our national security interests. Congress must ensure that the FISA process isn't abused for partisan political gain like it was during the Obama administration. 
So now, Mr. McCabe, to my first question, the Inspector General found 17 errors and omissions in the Carter Page FISA application. There were also over 50 errors and omissions in the Woods file for the Page FISA application. In light of these overwhelming mistakes, the obvious lack of evidence, and the failure to fully apprise the FISA court of relevant exculpatory facts, the investigation simply didn't have foundation to proceed. 
If you were diligent doing the job, how did you miss all of these critical mistakes and failures that have tarnished the FBI for probably years to come? 
MCCABE: Well, I don't agree with your characterization of the investigation being illegitimate or flawed. There are clearly the flaws that you have referenced, the ones pointed out by the IG should not have taken place in the FISA application, which is only one part of an overall investigation into Mr. Page and three other individuals. An investigation that, I would point out, the IG indicated was for an authorized purpose properly predicated. 
GRASSLEY: According to the Inspector General, the Steele dossier was central and essential to the Carter Page FISAs. However, according to your testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, the dossier was wasn't fully vetted and corroborated before it was used in the FISA application. Why didn't you ensure that the FBI performed its due diligence before the dossier was used to justify invasive surveillance on an American citizen? 
MCCABE: The FBI is not required by the court to only present information that has been absolutely verified and proven true. We often use information that we have not yet gotten to the bottom of. We are required to provide information about the source of that information so that the court is adequately aware of, you know, what we know about what we saw told them and--and how we think about its verification. Into this case, we were in the middle of a very long and extensive effort trying to prove the many allegations in the Steele reporting. 
GRASSLEY: On January 4th, 2017, the FBI prepared a memo to close the Flynn case and noted no derogatory information was identified. That same day, Mr. Strzok interceded to keep it open. Did you order Strzok or anyone else to keep it open? If not, who did? 
MCCABE: I don't recall ordering Peter to keep--or Mr. Strzok to keep that investigation opened. I think that obviously that's what happened, but I--I don't know who gave that order. 
GRASSLEY: Okay. Did anyone ever instruct you to keep the Flynn case open? If so, who? 
MCCABE: No one ever instructed me to keep the Flynn case open. We had conversations about the Flynn case towards the end of 2016 and whether or not we should keep it open. There was some thought that we had not developed much information about--during the course of the information, that it might be appropriate to close the case. 
However, those thoughts changed as soon as we became aware that we had evidence of General Flynn's conversations with the Russians. So our initial concern that General Flynn might be the point of contact between the Trump campaign and the Russians was elevated when we found evidence that he was in fact in touch with the Russians. 
GRASSLEY: During your time at the FBI, how many Logan Act investigations were you a part of? 
MCCABE: I do not recall ever having been a part of a Logan Act investigation. 
GRASSLEY: Based on the evidence I've seen, much of which has been made public, the FBI was out to get Flynn and they broke every rule in the books to interview him and tried to entrap him. With the Obama administration FBI did to Flynn under your watch is a textbook example of the power of the federal government can be abusive and--and hurt the American people. 
Now, going to leaks, the subject of leaks. L-E-K-S. I've made this point before, but it's frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee's questions in full but leaks relevant information to the media. I asked then Director Comey on May 2017 whether he ever served as an anonymous source in news reports about matters released relating to the Trump investigation or Clinton investigation. His response: ""never."" So the next question to you, Deputy Director McCabe, was that a true and accurate answer based on your experience working for him? 
MCCABE: Well first, senator, to be clear, I strongly disagree with your characterization of our investigation of General Flynn. But with respect to your question about Mr. Comey's testimony to you about being the source of anonymous leaks, I don't have any--I don't have any information about that. I--that's--I don't know. 
GRASSLEY: In that same May 27th--2017 hearing, I asked then Director Comey whether you authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or Clinton investigation. His answer was no. So Mr. McCabe, was that a true and accurate answer based on your experience of working for him? 
MCCABE: I am not aware of Director Comey authorizing or directing people to be anonymous sources for the media. 
GRASSLEY: The Justice Department's Inspector General report on your disclosing of information to the media, lack of candor, or lying under oath contained references to a Clinton Foundation investigation, specifically that report said that you had a conversation with a Justice Department official about the Clinton investigation and in that conversation, you reportedly stated ""Are you telling me that I need to shut down a valid, predicated investigation?"" Why did you believe the Clinton foundation investigation was validly predicated? 
MCCABE: Well, I'm not sure I can answer that question because it's, first, beyond the scope of what we were told to--I'd be questioning about today and also would call for me to reveal information that I'm not sure the FBI--I haven't been authorized by the FBI to discuss. But I would point out, senator, that the director and the deputy director of the FBI are the only two FBI officials who had the authority and the responsibility to authorize the release of information to the media. And so, I think that's--your questions or overlooking that important distinction. So that's--that's it. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Klobuchar, it will go to you in a second. I just want to--based on what you said, you say that you present information to the court sometimes that's not fully proven, is that right, when it comes to a warrant? 
MCCABE: That's correct. We often present information in warrants that we have not yet finished verifying. 
GRAHAM: Do you have an obligation when you find information exculpatory to provide it to the court? 
MCCABE: In the FISA process, agents are obligated to present information that might cut--might cut against, you know, the veracity of a source or, you know, you're obligated to present information that puts the court in a position to accurately assess whether they believe, you know, the source information you presented. 
GRAHAM: So that's why if you alter an email from the CIA saying that Mr. Page actually was a source, that's misleading to the court and that's why Mr. Clinesmith is being prosecuted. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: That is my understanding. 
GRAHAM: And finally, it we'll go to when you have information in the possession of the FBI in January and March where the sub source basically dis advised the legitimacy of the dossier, a lot of it is bar talk and hearsay, can you tell us how that never made it to you by June of 2017? How could that information have been gathered in January and March 2017 and not known to the system as late as June 2017? Do you know? Did you talk to Mr. Alton (SP) about this at all? 
MCCABE: I'm not sure--I don't I'm not sure who that was you just refer to, but I can't say-- 
GRAHAM: No, excuse me, the June March interview of the sub source by the FBI was conducted by Mr. Alton and a few other agents and that's when the sub source told us, basically, that a lot of it was bar talk, hearsay, gutted the reliability of it. And my question is you've said if you've known if you'd known then what you know now, you wouldn't have signed the warrant application. Do you have an explanation as to why that information never made it to you and others? 
MCCABE: No, sir, but I think that the team--there is no question that the crossfire team should have had a much more thorough conversation with the Department of Justice attorneys who were responsible for preparing that package. They should have had full visibility on those facts and made an informed decision as to whether or not they should have been included in the package. 
GRAHAM: And your testimony is that no one told you about these interviews, the substance of them. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Klobuchar. 
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back, Mr. McCabe. Good to see you. This hearing was set up before this election. I know that, but since we got the notice on this hearing, we now know that we have a new president, President-elect Biden and a new vice president that we will see in Washington, and that is Vice President-elect Harris. And I just want to make it clear to anyone watching this right now out there in the virtual land that this is all about what happened before the 2016 election. Is that correct, Mr. McCabe? And--and around that time? 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. And in the 2016 election, Donald Trump won and Hillary Clinton lost. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: That's my understanding. 
KLOBUCHAR: Okay. That's--that's the correct answer, right? So now we move forward to this election in 2020 and we have a situation where our very democracy has spoken. We had the greatest number of people that voted ever in a presidential election. Are you aware of that, Mr. McCabe? 
MCCABE: Yes, ma'am. I'm aware. 
KLOBUCHAR: And do you think there were some improvements made on how we handled foreign interference in the election? 
MCCABE: I think it seems--of course, I'm not privy to all the information about what--what folks know and what steps they took, but it does seem to me that the efforts to bring greater security to our elections at the state level was--was time and effort well spent. 
KLOBUCHAR: Yes. And I personally, I think there's a lot more that needs to be done. Senator Graham and I have the Honest Ads Act, which I think would be really helpful for ads that are political ads that are taken out to make sure. I think you're aware of that bill and I think there's a lot more that can be done, but I think it's really important to know that the subject that we're talking about predates the 2016 election. 
And I want to talk about what's happening right now with the Justice Department and our election. And I really do it by light of what Vice President Biden said on Saturday night to the nation. He asked that the grim era of demonization be behind us. I'm sure that might have resonated with you a bit, Mr. McCabe. 
And that we understanding that--that some people didn't agree with him and voted for Donald Trump, but he literally reached out to people who voted for Donald Trump and he said look, I've been disappointed before. I've lost elections, but I'm asking you to give me the chance and I'll give you a chance. And so that is the approach that I take here and I know that it's hard to lose elections, but I think that we need to move on as a country. The pandemic, everything we have before us and really the integrity of our justice system. 
And I was actually very disheartened yesterday when Attorney General Barr told--sent out a memo to the U.S. attorneys throughout the country asking them to examine voting irregularities even before the states had certified their results. And I had actually gotten a letter back on October 23rd when he started questioning mail-in ballots early on and asked him to look at those because the federal prosecution of elections, the Justice Department's policy says, ""over criminal investigation measures should not be taken 'until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded.'"" 
So what happened yesterday is they decided to upend that policy and start getting on this train that there was something wrong with this election when in fact The Republican secretary of State in Georgia has stood by their election and said their isn't systematic fraud. The Republicans in Arizona the governor there, this is a state where Joe Biden basically has one with a few more votes to be counted. You look at what happened in Pennsylvania. 
So my concern is there appending this longstanding policy right when the election resulting and a career prosecutor, Mr. Pill--Pilger, I don't know if you know him, resigned yesterday because he saw this clearly, this is a reason for his resignation as political interference in the work of the Justice Department. So you spent decades in public service, Mr. McCabe, and I want to ask you what does it mean to you to see a career Justice Department employee resign like that? 
MCCABE: Well, I think is incredibly concerning. As undoubtedly, senator, you know from your own experience that people and the Department of Justice are typically committed to long and, you know, noble service. Not just--it's not just a job, it's a--it's a calling. It's what you choose to do with your life. So when people start resigning in protest over decisions that leadership makes, I think we should all take it very, very close look at that. 
Yeah, and--in terms of election fraud, generally, anytime you change a well-known, established policy regarding the political process in the middle of the political process, I think it raises some very legitimate concerns about what the motivation for that change was. And I think in the least case, it shines a very dim light on the department and it's impartiality. 
KLOBUCHAR: And with a new president coming in, what steps do you think we should be taking to restore public confidence in the department and improved morale in the department? 
MCCABE: You know, I think from my own experience I look back on my own experience and some of the decisions we made in the FBI, and of course many of the things that have happened since and you know, I think a return to the time honored principals in the department and in the Bureau of--of being very careful about how--what we do and how we do it around the political process is--I think that's something that most people in the department and the Bureau would--would really embrace. 
KLOBUCHAR: All right. Well, thank you, Mr. McCabe. Thank you very much. 
GRAHAM: Senator Cruz. 
CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCabe, welcome. I'd like to start by discussing the Flynn investigation. As you know, The FBI team investigating general Flynn prepared a memo dated January 4th, 2017 to close the investigation into Flynn as lacking any--any basis to continue. 
The FBI had investigated and failed to find any derogatory information about general Flynn and determined he was no longer a viable candidate for investigation. But then, according to Peter Strzok, the 7th floor, the top brass at the FBI intervened to keep the investigation open. Were you the one who made the decision to keep the investigation open? 
MCCABE: I don't remember making that decision, but I certainly supported keeping the case open. I don't remember being the person that made that phone call, but I think that it is the right move to continue investigating once we had uncovered the investigation--the information that we found. 
CRUZ: So despite the fact that the career invite investigators concluded that there was no basis and no derogatory information or recommended closing it, you made the decision or--and your--at least you agreed with the decision to keep the investigation open on--on what basis? 
MCCABE: Well, I don't know that--I don't recall that the investigators determined there was no basis to continue. My recollection from the conversations we were having about the Flynn case at that time-- 
CRUZ: --The memo is a memo to close the investigation because it could not find any ""Derogatory information about Flynn"" and he was ""No longer a viable candidate for investigation. That's not ambiguous, is it? 
MCCABE: No, that's not the same as what you said before. I of course don't have that memo in front of me, but our feeling at that time was that we had found very little if any incriminating evidence about General Flynn until, of course, we found potentially very incriminating evidence about him. 
CRUZ: Are you referring to the Logan Act theory? 
MCCABE: No sir, I am referring to the fact that we uncovered that General Flynn was having the sort of direct contact with the government of Russia that we were looking for in all of the first four cases of Crossfire Hurricane. 
CRUZ: Did you--did you support using the Logan Act as a basis to go after General Flynn? 
MCCABE: The Logan Act was not used as a basis to go after General Flynn. We opened the case on General Flynn-- 
CRUZ: --You're aware of the White House meeting where--where the note showed that Vice President Biden at the time directly suggested using the Logan Act to go after General Flynn? 
MCCABE: I'm not aware of that. 
CRUZ: You're not aware of that. Well, at those--those are notes from your colleagues. 
GRAHAM: I don't mean to interrupt, but I-- 
MCCABE: --Senator, I--senator, I can say what the reasons that I agreed with and approved opening the case, and that was because we thought that General Flynn might be having inappropriate contacts with Russia. That's why we opened the case and that's why-- 
CRUZ: --Inappropriate--so--so the only basis--this is a decorated three star general. The only basis that was put forward for what I think was a bogus political persecution and prosecution was an alleged violation of the Logan Act, which is has never been used to prosecute anybody in the history of the Department of Justice, true? 
MCCABE: No, I don't believe that's true. I think if you look at the-- 
CRUZ: --Name one person that's ever been prosecuted under the Logan Act. 
MCCABE: No, I was referring to why we opened the case against General Flynn. I'm not aware of prosecutions of the Logan Act. 
GRAHAM: If I may, I think for those who are listening, we're talking about a conversation between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador after the election while he's the national security advisor in waiting. Is that correct, Senator Cruz? 
CRUZ: We are. He's the incoming national security adviser. And Mr. McCabe, yesterday on MSNBC, Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security advisor to President Obama said that foreign leaders are already having conversations with Joe Biden ""Talking about the agenda they're going to pursue January 20th."" Mr. McCabe, based on that testimony, do you believe Joe Biden is violating the Logan Act? 
MCCABE: I'm not aware of Ben Rhodes' statements or--or-- 
CRUZ: --Take it on faith that he said what I read. Assuming that quote is accurate, and it said verbatim quote, is that a violation of the Logan Act under any plausible theory? 
MCCABE: I am not prepared to take your statement on faith and I'm also not prepared to conduct legal analysis of the Logan Act-- 
CRUZ: --All right, you're a lawyer. Have you ever answered a hypothetical in court? 
MCCABE: I'm not going to-- 
CRUZ: --If it is correct that I am accurately quoting it, something to the Department of Justice frequently did wrong in--in this investigation, if that is what Ben Rhodes said, if Joe Biden is talking with foreign leaders right now, does it violate the Logan Act, yes or no? 
MCCABE: I'm not going to opine on a hypothetical question about what the Biden campaign-- 
CRUZ: --Okay, he is talking with foreign leaders and it doesn't violate the Logan Act because the Logan Act is unconstitutional, which is why it's never been used to prosecute anyone. You authorized using it to go after General Flynn as part of a political persecution. 
I can give you the answer. Hell, no. Joe Biden is not violating the Logan Act. The reason you won't say it is because that was your flimsy political basis to go after a decorated war hero because you disagreed with--politically with President Trump. 
MCCABE: Sir, none of that is correct. 
CRUZ: Which part? Pick--pick any aspect. 
MCCABE: We didn't investigate General Flynn because we were concerned that he might violate the Logan Act. We were concerned that General Flynn-- 
CRUZ: --It is your testimony that Logan Act was not a predicate for the FBI and--and DOJ investigation into General Flynn. Really? 
MCCABE: There were no discussions of the Logan Act to the best of my recollection-- 
CRUZ: --There were no discussions of the Logan Act and the FBI or DOJ. That is your testimony under penalty of perjury before this committee? 
MCCABE: Senator-- 
CRUZ: --I warn you, there is abundant evidence that there were. 
MCCABE: Senator, if you're not going to let me finish my answer, I'm not going to be able to accurately answer your question. 
CRUZ: Please go ahead. What is your testimony? Is your testimony--you just said there was no discussion of the Logan Act. Is that--does that remain your testimony? 
MCCABE: No, Senator. That's where you cut off my testimony. 
CRUZ: Please continue. 
MCCABE: I would like to finish my answer-- 
CRUZ: --Please continue. 
MCCABE: Thank you. Thank you. When we initiated the case against General Flynn, it was not initiated for or as a result of any discussion of the Logan Act-- 
CRUZ: --Mr. McCabe, are being non-responsive to the question. I didn't ask about the initiation. The Logan Act was a late--a late pretext that was adopted after you investigated him and couldn't find anything and the career investigators recommended closing it. All right, it's--my time is expiring, the chairman took a little bit of my time comment so I'm going to take a little bit of it back, did James Comey authorize you to disclose information about the Clinton foundation investigation to the press? 
MCCABE: I didn't need James Comey's authorization. I have the authority-- 
CRUZ: --I didn't ask if you needed it. I asked did he authorize you to disclose it. That's a yes or no question. 
MCCABE: I authorized the disclosure-- 
CRUZ: --Okay, you're still not answering my question-- 
MCCABE: (INAUDIBLE) 
CRUZ: --Did James Comey know about it and did he authorize it? Yes or no? Did he know about it? 
MCCABE: To my recollection, sir, yes, he knew about it. 
CRUZ: Did he authorize you--did he did you--that he in any way give you the green light explicitly or implicitly? 
MCCABE: I didn't ask Jim Comey-- 
CRUZ: --I--I'm not asking whether you asked. I'm asking--okay, according to The Washington Times, April 18th 2018, Mr. McCabe insisted he told his boss that--that he had authorized disclosure about the Clinton investigation, but Mr. Comey has denied this claim and Mr. McCabe told investigators that Mr. Comey knew he had authorized disclosure and agreed it was a good idea. Is that accurate? Is that your testimony to this committee? 
MCCABE: That is my recollection. 
CRUZ: So you're aware that your testimony is 180 degrees opposite Mr. Comey's sworn testimony to this committee in which he insisted he has never authorized anybody to leak to the press? 
MCCABE: I don't--I'm not going to say what Director Comey said or didn't say to you. That would--however, your characterization of a leak is not accurate. 
CRUZ: The FBI has records that will establish whether you're telling the truth or Mr. Comey is telling the truth. Do you believe the FBI should make those records public so if you're telling the truth you can be vindicated and if Mr. Comey is telling the truth, he can be vindicated? 
MCCABE: I'm not sure what records you're referring to, Senator, but we-- 
CRUZ: --Any and all emails, correspondence, records whatsoever indicating that Mr. Comey knew of your leaks and authorized them. 
MCCABE: I would very much like to see those records as well. 
CRUZ: As would I. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal, but I just want to--the American people to understand that was it wrong for General Flynn to talk to the Russian ambassador since he was going to be the new incoming National Security Advisor? 
MCCABE: Is that a question to me? 
GRAHAM: Yes, sir. 
MCCABE: Our concerns about General Flynn and his contact with Ambassador Kislyak was that the general might be maintaining some sort of hidden or deniable contact and that he might have been the person in the campaign who coordinated efforts with the Russian government. The fact that General Flynn lied about his Contacts with the Russians made it doubly concerning to us. The fact that General Flynn then lied to his boss, the vice president, about those contacts also was greatly concerning to us. 
GRAHAM: Well let me just say this, General Flynn told the FBI agents, you have the transcripts, you know what I said. The FBI agents came back and said they didn't think he lied, but the problem we have here is this is after the election is over, that the national security adviser has every right in the world to be talking to foreign governments, foreign ambassadors. It's going on as I speak. 
I'm sure the Biden administration believing they have won is beginning to reach out to foreign governments to talk about their agenda, whether it be China or anybody else. This whole idea that you would surveil the incoming national security adviser after the election, after the professionals in the field said there's no there--there bothers a lot of us. Senator Blumenthal. 
BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCabe, let me give you an opportunity since you've been interrupted by my colleague in the midst of actually threats of perjury to clarify any of the answers or expand on them in any way that you would like. If there's anything you have to add, I'd welcome your remarks. If not, I'll turn to my questions. 
MCCABE: Thank you, Senator. I think it's important to keep in perspective that the FBI opens counterintelligence cases sometimes when they suspect someone may have had inappropriate or improper or illegal contact with a foreign power. 
During the course of that investigation, if you confirm that that contact has taken place and then you learn that that person is also actively concealing the contact, concealing it from, in General Flynn's case, the FBI and also from the White House chief of staff, at the White House Counsel's Office, enter the vice president, your fears about possible threat to national security or very justifiably elevated. That is what happened in this case. And so questions about a Logan Act prosecution that never took place I think are misplaced. 
BLUMENTHAL: That's a really important point, Mr. McCabe. I regret that my colleague isn't here to hear it, but I'm sure he'll review the record. We should note, I think at the beginning that we are now in the midst of a fourth hearing to investigate both the 2016 election, and the investigations and investigators who themselves have already been investigated. 
So we're spending all the time in the world to look back in 2016 as families and businesses in Connecticut, and I think in the states of every one of my colleagues are hanging by a thread due to the public health and economic crises caused by COVID. This crisis has been ignored and disregarded by this administration, which is the reason that President Trump was defeated. It is a dereliction of their duty to their constituents and to the American people to continue to focus on a 2016 investigation that already has been investigated. 
And I think your point about the reasons for that interest in the conversations between potential Trump officials and the Russian ambassador or very well taken. I also want to say that I am deeply troubled, as my colleagues are, by the statements made by Attorney General Barr who, again, is acting apparently as a puppet of the president rather than a lawyer for the American people. He is throwing gasoline on the fires of false claims of fraud, fueling doubts and undermining faith in the integrity of our election process. 
There are no facts or evidence that justify investigation. He knows it, but he is giving a patina of credibility two baseless and destructive accusation. I would suggest, respectfully, that Attorney General Barr has taken his office to a new law and the ramifications are profound and dangerous for our country. This kind of scaremongering is no substitute for the truth. 
The fact is the votes have been countered and some are being counted and they have shown and will continue to confirm that former Vice President Biden is in fact our president-elect. But in the meantime, the litigation challenging the integrity of our election process will continue frivolous and baseless though it is and now, apparently given more credibility by the attorney general of the United States, regretfully and unfortunately. 
I want to ask you about a threat to our country that is real. Just a few months ago, the FBI director publicly testified to the House Committee on Homeland Security that ""Racially motivated violence extremists of extremism"" constitutes a majority of domestic terrorism threats. In fact, white supremacists in particular were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 and 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016. That's more than any other extremist movement. 
Recent attacks include the April 2014 mass shooting at a Jewish Community Center in Kansas, the June 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, and others. Mr. McCabe, let me ask you, how long have we known that white supremacists another far right wing extremist pose significant domestic terrorism national security or public security and safety threats to the United States? 
MCCABE: We've known about the threats posed to this country by domestic terrorists and specifically white supremacists and right wing groups for many, many years. Certainly, long before I even joined the FBI. And one of the seminal moments in my desire to join the organization was when I, like the rest of the country, sat in horror on the day that the Alfred P. Murrah federal building was destroyed in Oklahoma City. 
So this is not a new threat. I think what's new for the FBI right now is the focus and intensity they are bringing on this problem set, which is absolutely called for and necessary. 
BLUMENTHAL: And when the president makes the kind of comments that he did, and I'm sure you're familiar with them that a particular right wing group should stand back and stand by, do those kinds of comments have an effect on those groups in encouraging them? 
MCCABE: They absolutely do. Favorable references and shout outs and comments to these fringe groups have the effect of confirming their beliefs. They interpret these comments as--as signals and signs of approval and support and really can risk putting more momentum and kind of fervor behind what they're planning to do. 
BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. McCabe. My time has expired. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much. I think we are waiting to see-- 
MCCABE: --Senator--Senator Graham? 
GRAHAM: Yes--yes, sir? 
MCCABE: I'm sorry, sir. Would it be possible to take a brief break-- 
GRAHAM: --Absolutely. Let's--absolutely, sir. Five minutes, is that okay? Is that-- 
MCCABE: --That would be great. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Okay. We'll take a five-minute break. Thank you. 
(RECESS) 
GRAHAM: Okay, give him a few more minutes. Mr. McCabe? Mr. McCabe? Mr. McCabe? 
MCCABE: Can you hear me now? Hello? Hello? 
GRAHAM: Yes, I--you with us? 
MCCABE: Yes, sir. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Yeah, I apologize for not--anytime you feel like you need a break, you just let me know. I apologize that it's been over two hours. And I--I apologize for--for not remembering that. So, Senator Hirono? 
HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague Senator Durbin and others on the Democratic side on why we are here for the fourth time to go over ground already covered, particularly by Inspector General Horowitz's 434 page report. 
And the witness was asked questions about text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page when it is clear that they did not impact to the validity of the Russian investigation. And yet, we have real facts about national security concerns such as President Trump calling the president of Ukraine to shake him down to help his reelection campaign, my Republican colleagues don't think that's a big deal. 
Now, I can understand why President Trump wanted to get dirt on his potential political opponent, especially as the--as Joe Biden in fact defeated President Trump decisively, a fact that many of my Republican colleagues have yet to be able to acknowledge. And so, we are here for the fir--fourth time for many more hours of hearings on grounds that we should have covered--we've already covered instead of dealing with the real questions of the day. 
So, for this witness, you were asked by Senator Blumenthal about the recognized danger of white supremacists. And I--I just want to reiterate because I think it is very important for the--for our country to understand the dangers posed by these persons. 
So, in September 2020, FBI Director Wray warned that white supremacy is one of the biggest domestic terrorism threats. News reports around the same time also indicated that the Department of Homeland Security had reached a similar conclusion, that white supremacists are the deadliest, the deadliest domestic terror threat facing the country. I'd like to ask--ask you again, given your extensive experience in counterterrorism issues, do you believe that the threat posed by white supremacists is a serious concern? 
MCCABE: Well, senator, I know that it is a serious concern. And I certainly take Director Wray's assessment that it is the most serious concern on the counterterrorism side that we face right now. 
It makes a lot of sense in light of the fact that, as our foreign terrorist targets appear to be in a state of less organization and their operational activity and recruitment in this country seems to have tailed off a bit, I don't have any access to the classified information but it certainly seems that way, there's no question in that the domestic terrorist scene has not tailed off. If anything, it has increased over the last few years. 
HIRONO: And you indicated that the kind of words used by the president simply seems to fan those flames of domestic terrorism activities. 
MCCABE: That's correct, and-- 
HIRONO: --I believe you-- 
MCCABE: --That's correct-- 
HIRONO: --Responded that way. 
MCCABE: Yes. 
HIRONO: Okay. Before the election, President Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr repeatedly made false claims of mail-in voter fraud. In September 2020, FBI Director Wray testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee that, ""We have not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud incurred in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise."" 
Now that millions of Americans have voted without evidence of fraud, President Trump and the Republicans have refused to recognize the results of the election, and instead they have gone to court many times at this point, losing much pretty every--I think that they've lost every single one of these voter fraud cases, to prevent valid--validly cast votes from being counted. And President Trump continues to falsely claim that he has won the election with absolutely no evidence. 
Given your extensive experience at the FBI, are you aware of any evidence indicating that widespread mail-in voter fraud is a problem in our country? 
MCCABE: I'm not aware of any information to that effect. Director Wray's assessment is--is consistent with my own experience in the FBI, that I've never seen information that would substantiate a--a--an effort--a widespread effort at voter fraud. 
HIRONO: And while my Republican colleagues are very busy talking about how the president has a right to go to court, that--you know, that--that still puts the burden of proving that there is actual fraud on him. And so far, he has been losing at every turn. So, just because one has a right to go--go to court doesn't make it right to go to court. And one would hope that the president would have figure that out by now, but apparently not. 
When--when you mentioned in your opening that it was an honor and a privilege to work for the FBI, there--there are concerns for many of us about the politicizing of the FBI and DOJ. And since taking office, President Trump has repeatedly called on the Justice Department, i.e., at his many rallies where they chant lock her up or lock him up or whatever it is, to investigate his political opponents and leaned on Attorney General Barr to treat his allies more favorably. 
For example, under Attorney General Barr, the Justice Department reversed a sentencing recommendation for Trump ally Roger Stone, prompting all four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case in protest. You have served for 21 years at the FBI. In your memory, before President Trump, how many times has a president called for the investigation or arrest of political opponents to aid him in his reelection campaign? 
MCCABE: I--I--never, not in my experience. I've never seen that before. 
HIRONO: In June 2020, two Justice Department career lawyers testified, they actually testified before the House about how Trump political appointees intervened in criminal and antitrust cases to advance the personal interests of President Trump. What do you think it says about the severity of the politicizing of the Justice Department that two career DOJ lawyers came forward to testify about it before Congress, and all four career prosecutors made the extraordinary move of withdrawing from the Roger Stone case? 
MCCABE: As I've said, senator, career prosecutors don't walk away from cases that they believe in and cases that they've spent a lot of time and effort trying to move forward. So, when you have any member of the Department of Justice who feels compelled to resign from a case or from the department for--for ethical reasons, that's a very concerning thing. When you have four on one case resign, I think it's the sort of thing that we can't possibly ignore. 
HIRONO: It's quite extraordinary. And--and I would like at this point to commend all of the career DOJ people, including, of course, all the people at the FBI for doing the jobs they're--they're supposed to be doing and not making political decisions. 
Now, we know that hate crimes against the AAPI community has gone up, and especially with the president calling the virus a China virus, the Wuhan virus, and members of this administration have also referred to it as Kung flu. So, there has been documented increase in hate crimes against the AAPI communities. 
Given your extensive experience at the FBI, do you think the FBI and Justice Department are doing enough to address hate crimes in our country, including against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders? And do you know of any prosecution by the DOJ on a--any of these hate crimes? 
MCCABE: I--I'm not aware of recent prosecutions of hate crimes. Again, I don't have access to all of the information that the FBI or DOJ has, and so I can't speak to whether they're doing that work or not. It certainly seems that those sort of incidents, just from what I hear in open-source reporting, seem to be on the rise. And I would expect that the bureau and--and DOJ should be looking at those things very closely. 
HIRONO: I should hope so, because so far I don't know of any indictments coming down on these kinds of cases. 
I believe my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. McCabe. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much, Senator. I think we have Senator Hawley on the line, but I got a--just a real brief inquiry here. Mr. McCabe, what is a defensive briefing? 
MCCABE: A defensive briefing is typically when we reach out to an individual who we think might be the subject of some sort of, you know, malign activity from a--from a foreign government or a foreign power and try to, you know, make them aware of the threats that they might come across. 
GRAHAM: An example would be I think Senator Feinstein had a staff member that was suspected of being connected to the Chinese intelligence community, and she was briefed about that. Is that correct? Would that be an example? 
MCCABE: That sounds like the sort of information in--or sort of situation in which we would give defensive briefing. 
GRAHAM: And as she took corrective action by dismissing that person. Was there ever a defensive briefing given to Hillary Clinton about concerns about her campaign being reached out to or interfered regarding foreign actors? 
MCCABE: I'm not sure, senator. I saw some of the documents on--on the committee's website seem to indicate that, but I don't have an independent recollection of--of that reason. 
GRAHAM: Well, I--I can just assure you that she was. There was a--a suspicion that a foreign government may have been trying to aid her campaign. She was briefed about it. 
Counterintelligence investigations are designed to protect entities from foreign influence. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question? 
GRAHAM: Counterintelligence investigations are designed to protect American interests against foreign influence. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: That's right. Counterintelligence investigations are designed to mitigate threats to national security. 
GRAHAM: So, like Senator Feinstein could fire somebody that was on her staff to mitigate it. Is that a good example? 
MCCABE: That--that can certainly be one way to mitigate a threat. 
GRAHAM: At--at any time during the multiple counterintelligence investigations that were conducted against Trump campaign officials, was there ever a defensive briefing given to President Trump about the concerns you had about Mr. Papadopoulos, Carter Page, or anyone else, including General Flynn? 
MCCABE: Not that I'm aware of. 
GRAHAM: Why? 
MCCABE: Well, senator, we typically don't provide defensive briefings when we feel that they could run the risk of compromising the investigations that we're undertaking. So, before we provide a briefing, we try to determine whether or not that briefing will ultimately get communicated back to the target or somehow obstruct our ability to shed some light on whether or not there is actually a threat to national security. 
GRAHAM: So, when it came to Papadopoulos, you never told the Trump campaign you may have a problem with him? 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
GRAHAM: And when it comes to Carter Page, you never sat down with President Trump, ""We've got concerns about Carter Page?"" 
MCCABE: I do not believe that happened. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
GRAHAM: Senator Hawley? 
HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start by saying that I heard, I think, my Democratic colleagues wondering aloud why it is that we're here today. And I have to say I would have thought that would have been obvious by now, that we're here because we're looking at maybe the biggest scandal in the history of the FBI. 
We're looking at the use of the FBI to interfere in a presidential election. We're looking at the use of the FBI to lie to the FISA court, to so misrepresent facts, statements, and other material to this court that the court had to issue a statement saying that they could not trust the FBI not only in this case, but in potentially every the case going forward. 
Absolutely unbelievable, unprecedented, for a court to issue a rebuke of this nature. And I have to say the fact that my Democratic colleagues want to just shrug and move on in the face of this kind of interference, this kind of inappropriate behavior, this abuse of power, which is what it is, is really extraordinary. And of course, the individual we have before us today has an entire report written by the IG about how he lied repeatedly. And it's--so, that's why we're here. 
And by the way, now that we're in the middle of another election, the outcome of which is still disputed and unknown, and people are wondering why is it that so many Americans don't have trust in the electoral process, this is why they don't have trust in the electoral process. This is why. 
It's because we've seen instance after instance of the abuse of the institutions of this country to try to interfere with the voice and the will of we the people, and we're looking at it today. That's what this is about. If anybody is in--in any--has any question, that's what this is about. 
Now, let's talk a little bit about that lying to the FISA court, which the FBI did repeatedly and DOJ signed off on. Mr. McCabe, let me come to you now. You know, I've had a--something of a--of a personal quest here to try to find somebody who will take some responsibility for these warrants that they signed off on, for these applications that they personally signed off on. You signed off on a renewal application for the Carter Page FISA warrant on June 28th, 2017, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
HAWLEY: Now, by January of 2017, the FBI had identified and interviewed Christopher Steele's primary sub-source, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: That is correct. 
HAWLEY: And those interviews cast serious doubts on the accuracy of the Steele dossier, to put it mildly, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: I know that now, yes. 
HAWLEY: The FISA renewal application that you signed, however, did not acknowledge any of those facts, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: The FISA package that I signed contained the same--contained the--the errors that are laid out in the IG report. 
HAWLEY: Uh-huh. And by December 2016, so this is months before the renewal application, the Crossfire Hurricane team knew that the primary sub-source of the Steele dossier was suspected of being a Russian asset, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: I can't--I--I don't believe that's correct. No, I don't--I don't know that to be the case. 
HAWLEY: Your--so, your testimony--testimony under oath is that the Crossfire Hurricane did not know that the primary sub-source was potentially a Russian agent as of December 2016? 
MCCABE: I can't tell you what the members of the team thought about--about the primary sub-source in December of 2016. If you're referring to the recent footnote from the FISA report that was declassified by the attorney general, no, I don't--I don't know that they knew that then. I--I can't say what they knew. 
HAWLEY: The FISA application that you signed contained none of this, though, correct? It--it contained no new disclosures to the court. It contained none of the information that the FBI absolutely knew of. It contained nothing to give the court any pause about anything that you'd previously certified. Isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: Well, I think you need to be--we--we should be specific about what we-- 
HAWLEY: --No, no, no, just answer my question. Did--did--the application that you personally signed, did it disclose the interviews back from January of 2017 that you just said that you were aware of, that the FBI was aware of? 
The OIG report details this at pages 187, 188, and 189 of this report. You can go look it up. He's got a lot to say about you. You can go look up that IG report. They say that the FBI knew of the problems with the primary--this--this Christopher Steele's primary sub-source and did not disclose it to the court. Isn't that correct, yes or no? 
MCCABE: The--the IG report, it's my understanding, sir, detailed 17 errors that were present in the package that you're referring to. 
HAWLEY: Mr. McCabe, don't fence with me. Answer my question. Did the report that you personally signed, did it disclose the FBI's interviews in January of 2017? You signed the new application in June 2017. Did it disclose the interviews casting serious doubt on the primary sub-source, yes or no? We both know the answer is no, but why don't you just say it? No, right? 
MCCABE: It did not disclose-- 
HAWLEY: --All right-- 
MCCABE: --serious-- 
HAWLEY: --Thank you for your answer-- 
MCCABE: --concerns with the primary sub-source. 
HAWLEY: Why--why--why didn't it? Why didn't you notify the court of this new information? Is it because you wanted to continue to undermine the election of Donald Trump? 
Let me ask you this. Didn't you send a text message on June 24th, 2016 saying that I hope the Brexit vote doesn't predict a similar outcome here in November? 
MCCABE: Okay. So, I'd like to-- 
HAWLEY: --Why did you send that message-- 
MCCABE: --That--I'd like to answer your question, sir, but I'm going to need a little bit of-- 
HAWLEY: --Go ahead-- 
MCCABE: --space to get in a complete answer. So-- 
HAWLEY: --Why didn't you answer--answer that question. Why did you send that text message? 
MCCABE: I--I am--sir, as you know, I have not been able to review my texts. I do not have my texts in front of me here. I requested access to my materials. I was denied that access, so I'm not prepared to answer-- 
HAWLEY: --Well, I can read it for you-- 
MCCABE: --Your questions based on my text messages. 
HAWLEY: Oh, is it because you don't recall them or you deny--here's what it says. ""I hope it,"" meaning the Brexit vote, ""Doesn't predict a similar outcome here in November,"" June 24th, 2016. Do you not--deny sending that message? 
MCCABE: I don't know, sir. I haven't seen any of those text messages-- 
HAWLEY: --You have no memory of it-- 
MCCABE: --in over four years. And I would like to be able to continue to--I'd like to give you a complete answer, but I'm having a hard time. When you speak over me, it cuts off my ability to-- 
HAWLEY: --All right-- 
MCCABE: --respond. 
HAWLEY: Well, why don't you answer my question? Do you have no memory of that text message, is that what you're saying, of June 26th--24th, 2016? 
MCCABE: Sir, I don't remember text messages I sent in 2016 and I haven't seen since then. So, yes, I don't have a recollection of text messages from four years ago, that's correct. 
HAWLEY: Yeah, very convenient. I notice that everybody who comes before this committee discovers they-- 
MCCABE: --It would be much less con-- 
HAWLEY: --No, I'm not done talking. 
MCCABE: It would have been really convenient-- 
HAWLEY: --I notice that everybody-- 
MCCABE: --to be able to review those materials before today. 
HAWLEY: --before this committee is having memory lapses, including you, Mr. McCabe. It's really extraordinary, really extraordinary. 
Let me ask you about this text message. Peter Strzok sent this to Lisa Page on August 15th, 2016. ""I want to believe the path that you threw out for consideration in Andy's office,"" that's you, ""That there's no way he gets elected,"" that's Trump, ""But I'm afraid we can't take that risk. I'd like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40--it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40."" Why were you talking about the likely outcome of an election with two-line agents who were working on a case, the Carter Page investigation, at that time involving the president? Don't you think that's inappropriate? 
MCCABE: I think your question is--the premise of your question is not accurate. I don't recollect ever talking to Peter Strzok or Lisa Page, only one of whom is an agent in the FBI, about the election or about that conversation that is referenced in their text message, which I was not a part of. 
HAWLEY: Oh, okay. So, you're saying that--that didn't happen? Are you denying that--that happened? 
MCCABE: I don't recall that ever happening. 
HAWLEY: Just before we leave the--the--the FISA warrant application that--that you signed, the renewal application, how is it that the court was so deliberately and disastrously misled such that it had to issue a public rebuke of the FBI? Do you take responsibility? 
MCCABE: I disagree with your characterization that the court was deliberately misled. 
HAWLEY: Oh, really? 
MCCABE: So, I--yeah, that's--that's correct. 
HAWLEY: You think it was just an accident? 
MCCABE: I think that there were numerous and objectionable errors and omissions in that package, but I don't-- 
HAWLEY: --Do you think that the falsification-- 
MCCABE: --Where-- 
HAWLEY: --of an email--do you think the falsification of the email to the FISA court was an accident? 
MCCABE: Senator, I am not aware of--okay, a--Mr. Clinesmith's activities I was not aware of until I read the IG report. I know that he has taken responsibility for those representations. And I--I'm--that--I understand that. The errors and omissions in that package other than Mr. Clinesmith's admitted activities over the report from the CIA, I do not know any of those other errors to have been proven to be intentional acts. 
GRAHAM: Senator? 
HAWLEY: Right. Okay. So, we've established that--that-- 
GRAHAM: --Senator Hawley-- 
HAWLEY: --At least one-- 
GRAHAM: --Senator Hawley, your time is expired. 
HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Senator Blackburn? 
BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCabe, thank you for being with us today. Listening to you just answering Senator Hawley's question, it reminded me that you are spending a lot of your time on CNN these days. And of course, this is not a debate on CNN. This is a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I have to say--when did you go to CNN? 
MCCABE: I'm sorry. Was that a question of when I began-- 
BLACKBURN: --Yeah. Yeah, I--well, I'll answer it for you. Was in August? Was it in 2019? I think that may be right. I think you're pretty lucky-- 
MCCABE: --It--it might be. I--I don't-- 
BLACKBURN: --to have landed-- 
MCCABE: --remember the exact date, senator. 
BLACKBURN: Yeah. 
MCCABE: I don't--sorry. I'm sorry. I don't remember the exact date, senator, but that--that--that sounds about right. 
BLACKBURN: Sounds right, yeah. I think you're pretty lucky to have landed a job pretty much anywhere after having been fired from the FBI. And I think that the IG publicly flogging you in his report and the AG fired you a month later, and that was a--a pretty sad demise, I guess, of your career in public service. And you were set to retire at the tender young age of 49, isn't that correct? 
MCCABE: No, ma'am-- 
BLACKBURN: --Okay-- 
MCCABE: --That's not correct. 
BLACKBURN: What is correct? 
MCCABE: FBI agents become eligible to retire when they reach age 50. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. All right. And you've got a lawsuit against the federal government now, claiming that you had a record of unblemished and nonpartisan public service, and you're demanding that the court reinstate your employment as deputy director of the FBI and pay you your full pension. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: That sounds correct, ma'am, but I'll let the-- 
BLACKBURN: --Okay-- 
MCCABE: --legal papers speak for themselves. 
BLACKBURN: You know, let me--let me ask you this. Listening to you today and having read some of the things around your career, how did you get caught up in such a web of deceit and obstruction and cover up? And is this culture standard operating procedure at the FBI? 
MCCABE: Well, I don't--I don't--I'm not sure I understand the point of your question. But I--I also don't-- 
BLACKBURN: --The point of my question is this-- 
MCCABE: --agree with the characterization of-- 
BLACKBURN: --I'll help you with it-- 
MCCABE: --the culture at the FBI. 
BLACKBURN: Let me help you with that. You didn't want to answer Senator Cruz's questions about corruption, and I can understand why. But what you have to understand, that as overconfident as you all were in the plot that you were carrying out at the FBI in your government job, paid for by taxpayer dollars, you all had created this web and culture of corruption and cover up and obstruction, and you thought that you could do it--you thought you would be able to get by with it, but you got caught. 
You've said today that you wish you could reconsider your decision in requesting the FISA warrant on Carter Page and whether or not Director Comey should have held the press conference on Hillary Clinton. And listening to your--your answers, I think it's--I--I have never heard of a--an action--every criminal I have heard in a case, they generally will say they wish they hadn't committed the crime, or that someone who has done something wrong wishes they had not done that wrong. So, you took these actions. You've been called out by the IG and the AG. Why shouldn't you be prosecuted for your actions? 
MCCABE: Senator, first of all, there was absolutely no plot or scheme or conspiracy among my--between myself or any of the folks that I worked with in the work that you've referred to, okay? Secondly, I'm not aware of a single--other than Mr. Clinesmith's admissions, I am not aware of a single act or even an allegation against anyone who was involved in these cases-- 
BLACKBURN: --Was the IG wrong-- 
MCCABE: --of having committed a crime. 
BLACKBURN: Was the IG wrong? 
MCCABE: And I'd like to finish my--I'd like to finish my answer, senator. 
BLACKBURN: Well, it's my time and I've-- 
MCCABE: --I am not aware of-- 
BLACKBURN: --Only got two minute left. How long have you known Christopher Steele? 
MCCABE: I--I do not know Christopher Steele. 
BLACKBURN: I think you've known him about two decades, right? How long has Bruce-- 
MCCABE: --No, I-- 
BLACKBURN: --Ohr known Christopher Steele? 
MCCABE: To be clear, Senator, I don't know Christopher Steele. I've never met Christopher Steele, so that's not correct. And I don't--I can't tell you how long Bruce Ohr has known Christopher Steele. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. The exculpatory information on the Crossfire Hurricane--on Carter Page's recorded conversations, and that was not disclosed. What are the consequences under the FBI rules for when an FBI agent lies or otherwise misleads a federal court? 
MCCABE: So, the--the failure to disclose the Carter Page information is not a--as far as I'm aware, was not determined to be a deliberate misrepresentation to the court. The--so, to answer your question about misrepresentations to the court generally, FBI people would be disciplined in--in the same way anyone in the judicial system would if they were found to have deliberately and intentionally misled the court. 
BLACKBURN: So, you feel like no one did anything wrong. 
MCCABE: I am simply following the findings of the inspector general, which documented Mr. Clinesmith's intentional acts, but failed to find any evidence, documentary or testimonial, to indicate that the other mistakes in the FISA package were the result of intentional misconduct. 
BLACKBURN: Do you think you are wrongly fired? 
MCCABE: Yes. Yes, I do think I was wrongly fired. Yes. 
BLACKBURN: And you think you did nothing wrong? 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
BLACKBURN: Even though the IG pointed out that you did, and even though you all had a culture of corruption and cover up, that you thought it was okay to spy on Carter Page, it was okay to mislead Michael Flynn. This is a sad state of affairs, and I am pleased that you are no longer a part of the FBI. 
MCCABE: Senator, I'd like to answer those allegations. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. Please, go ahead. 
MCCABE: Yeah. So, no, I categorically refuse to agree with your assertions. No one that I am aware of in the FBI conducted any activity that should leave them susceptible to criminal prosecution, certainly including myself as someone who has now been the subject of investigative activity for years for no--baseless--the subject of a baseless investigation conducted by the U.S. attorney's office for almost 2 years, which concluded in a dismissal of their case. 
So, no, I don't believe that I committed any crime. I know I never committed any crime working for the FBI. And yes, I believe that the conclusions in the IG's report were baseless. I believe it was a flawed and misleading and deeply unfair investigation that led to the unfair--my unfair termination. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. 
BLACKBURN: Well, if you know nothing about what was done and Yates and Rosenstein and Comey all said they knew nothing about any of this, how in the world did it get so far off track? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. We'll go to Senator Kennedy next, but this is an important point. If somebody knew that the dossier was unreliable, do they have a duty to report to the system the information they found? 
MCCABE: I--I--I think that's--I think that's true, yes. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Is it fair to fire somebody who knew and failed to report? 
MCCABE: Well, it would depend, I guess, on the circumstances of where and how that happened, but it certainly seems-- 
GRAHAM: --Well, see, Mr.-- 
MCCABE: --That that could be the result. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. Mr. McCabe, here's the problem. The problem is that by June of 2016, it was pretty clear that the document, the dossier, was no longer reliable, that multiple stop signs had been run, that the CIA is suggesting that maybe Hillary Clinton signed off a plan to cook this whole thing up. She was defensively briefed. Trump never was. 
And the fact that this information was gathered in January and March, the--stunning to now know that the sub-source disavowed the document that was used to get a warrant, and nobody at the top had any idea that that occurred is just earth-shatteringly disappointing. Do you understand how people could be disappointed in that? 
MCCABE: I do understand how people could be disappointed in that, sir. I'm disappointed in it myself. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. And the point is, after a while, Mr. McCabe, it gets to be hard to reconcile all of this and come out and say that there was--is it still your testimony that the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaign were equally treated when it came to allegations? 
MCCABE: I think that the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaign were treated very differently in accord--in the context of two very different investigations. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. I'm just saying that it seems to me that allegations were made by both. And I'll close--I'll sum that all up. Senator Kennedy? 
KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCabe, who is responsible for the misbehavior outlined by Inspector General Horowitz in his report about Misfire Hurricane? 
MCCABE: Well, it depends on what you're referring to, Senator. If you are referring to the--the intentional misconduct committed by Mr. Clinesmith, quite obviously Mr. Clinesmith's responsible for that. I think from a command perspective, Director Comey and myself and our subordinate leaders are all responsible for the failures in that package that were allowed to go forward. 
But if you're asking me who is responsible for intentional misconduct beyond Mr. Clinesmith's activity, I'm not aware that there's been a finding that others were engaged in intentional misconduct. 
KENNEDY: While you were either director or acting director of the FBI, the FBI decided to investigate two presidential campaigns, one Secretary Clinton, the other one then candidate Trump and later President Trump. I want to put aside Secretary Clinton for a second. 
When--when the FBI decided to investigate candidate Donald Trump, what questions did you ask? I mean, at some point, somebody came to you and said, hey, Mr. Deputy Director, we're going to--just--just so you'll know, we're going to in--investigate the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Do you remember when you were told that? 
MCCABE: So, if you're referring to our initiation of the Crossfire investigation, so the investigation of the Trump campaign, I do remember conversations at the-- 
KENNEDY: --Okay-- 
MCCABE: --end of July in 2016 after the-- 
KENNEDY: --I'm not interested in the dates. Excuse me for interrupting. I apologize. Would it be fair to say that the Christopher Steele dossier was the keystone of the investigation? 
MCCABE: No, sir, that's not accurate. 
KENNEDY: Oh. Well--well, what--how important was it? What word would you use? 
MCCABE: It had no importance. We were not in possession of that information when we initiated the case. 
KENNEDY: Okay. So, you're telling me when you initiated the case, Christopher Steele's dossier had nothing to do with your decision to go forward. 
MCCABE: That's correct. 
KENNEDY: That's your testimony today under oath? 
MCCABE: It is. 
KENNEDY: Okay. At some point, the Christopher Steele dossier became important, did it not? 
MCCABE: The Christopher Steele reporting came to us in the middle of September, and it became important to us at that time. 
KENNEDY: Okay. Now, when--when you heard about the Christopher Steele dossier, did you--did you ask to interview Mr. Steele? I mean, you're only investigating a candidate for president of the United States after you've already investigated one. Now you're on the second. Did you--did you say, hey, I'm the deputy director here. I'm responsible. I--I want to talk to Christopher Steele. Did you do that? 
MCCABE: I did not personally speak to Mr. Steele, but our investigative team traveled-- 
KENNEDY: --But--but why not-- 
MCCABE: --Traveled overseas to his-- 
KENNEDY: --Why not? You're the deputy--this is what I don't understand about this whole thing, Mr. McCabe. You're the deputy director of the FBI, and you've--your--your people have decided to investigate the Republican nominee for president of the United States after already investigating the Democratic nominee. And at least in part at some point it was based on the Chris Steele dossier. 
Now, you can run from that one, but you can't hide from it. Did you ever call your guys in, or gals, and say, hey, just a thought. I think I'd like to talk to Chris Steele to see how credible this guy is, because you say you've never known him. Did you do that? 
MCCABE: Senator, in my entire experience of 21 years as an FBI agent, I am not aware of a single instance of the deputy director of the FBI interviewing a source, and I did not do that in this case. 
KENNEDY: --Well, how many nominees for president of the United States have you investigated? 
MCCABE: I--I--I can't comment on that, sir. 
KENNEDY: Now--but you're telling me at no point you ever sat down and said, wait a minute, guys. This is--this is now all based--or substantially based on Chris Steele. I want to talk to this--I want to talk to this--this cowboy. You never did that. 
MCCABE: That is not an accurate characterization of our investigation. And the-- 
KENNEDY: --That's what you just said. You said you never talked to him. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. 
MCCABE: No, sir. I'm just trying to clarify that the Steele information didn't come to us until two and a half months after we'd opened the case. 
KENNEDY: Well, when it came to you-- 
MCCABE: --At that time-- 
KENNEDY: --When it came to you, did you--did you say, wait a minute, guys, this is my--my reputation on the line? I want to talk to Christopher Steele. 
MCCABE: No, senator, I sent my investigators to conduct the investigation. 
KENNEDY: Okay. Do you know who--do--do you know who Igor Danchenko is? 
MCCABE: I do not. 
KENNEDY: You have no idea who that is, even today? 
MCCABE: I am not going to speculate as to who he is. 
KENNEDY: Well, he was the sub-source that the Steele dossier was based on. So, you're telling me-- 
MCCABE: --Senator, I-- 
KENNEDY: --You're telling--I want to be sure I understand. You're the--you're the--you're the assistant director of the FBI. You've decided to investigate the Trump campaign. You get this dossier which, whether you admit it or not, was the basis for all the FISA warrants. You never sat down and said I want to talk to Chris dossier--or Chris Steele. If you had talked to Chris Steele, you would have found out that his sub-source was Igor Danchenko. That was his primary sub-source. 
Dan--Danchenko was not--he--he wasn't from Russia. He was some guy in Washington, DC working for Brookings, and he went to the University of Louisville. He went to Georgetown. He was buddies with Dr. Fiona Hill. He was relying on his drinking buddies. Why didn't all of you--you folks who are running the show say, wait a minute, this is all centered around Chris Steele, we better talk to Steele and we better talk to--to this guy Dan--Danchenko? 
MCCABE: Senator, it's important that I get--that I get this out, so if you could give me just a second. 
KENNEDY: Sure. 
MCCABE: I am not sure that the--I have read--I have now read the--the report of the sub- source interview, and the--the interviewee's name is still redacted in that report. So, I do not feel comfortable acknowledging or confirming or denying any identity that might be associated with that person. 
GRAHAM: His own lawyer said it was him. 
KENNEDY: Well, here's--here's--here's what I--what it looks like to the American people, Mr. McCabe. The FBI didn't even try here, the people making the decisions. You wanted to investigate Trump. I mean, this is a nominee for president of the United States. You've already investigated the other one and potentially screwed up her campaign. 
And so, you get the Steele dossier. You don't sit down, you personally, and Comey, you don't talk to--to--to Chris Steele. You don't even ask questions about where he got his information. Had you done that, you would have found that he got it from Danchenko. Danchenko is a jelly head, okay? He doesn't know what he's talking about. And it all would have come apart. But you never looked, and it sort of looks like you didn't want to. 
MCCABE: Is that a--is that a question? 
KENNEDY: Yes, sir. 
MCCABE: So, the--I can't possibly disagree more strongly with the way you framed that question. The--while it is true that I never sat personally with Mr. Steele or any of his alleged sources, our team spent a great deal of effort interviewing him, interviewing other people that they thought were relevant, and trying to get to the bottom of the material that he provided. 
So, no, we were not predisposed to investigating the president. It wasn't something we sought out to do. But we felt that the potential national security threat put us in a position where we were obligated to investigate. That's what we did. 
KENNEDY: And you expect the American people to believe that. 
MCCABE: That is the truth, and I certainly hope they believe it. 
KENNEDY: General Flynn has been prosecuted for lying to the FBI. You lied to the F by--BI and you aren't being prosecuted. Don't you think that sends the wrong message to the American people? 
MCCABE: Senator, General Flynn's situation and mine have absolutely nothing in common. I never, ever intentionally misled the FBI or the IG under any circumstances. And I think that's probably the conclusion that the DC U.S. attorney's office came to when they dismissed the two-year investigation of me over that question. 
KENNEDY: I understand. But you weren't fired for parking in the handicapped parking spot at the FBI, were you? You were fired for lying, were you not? 
MCCABE: I was fired as a result of a deeply unfair and flawed IG investigation, and I am challenging that termination in federal court. 
KENNEDY: Okay. Last question, and--and I--do you have any idea, Mr. McCabe--I--I don't think Mr. Comey did--does. Do you have any idea how badly you and your colleagues have hurt the FBI, I mean, the premier law enforcement agency in all of human history? And it was just a handful of you. And now when the average American gets a knock on his or her door, FBI, I need to talk to you, at least half of them are thinking, oh, my gosh, is the agent a Republican or a Democrat? They probably know my party affiliation. Do you have any idea how much damage you've done? 
MCCABE: Sir, my colleagues and I never took any action to under--to undermine our effectiveness, undermine our oath to this Constitution and the American people and the work that we did for the FBI. I deeply regret how politicized the FBI has become in light of the rhetoric and the relentless attacks levied upon it over the last four years. And I have great faith that my former colleagues will continue to do their work and ignore those sort of baseless attacks. 
KENNEDY: Well, at best, what you and Mr. Comey and the others did, at worst it was intentional. And--and I--I don't know what's in your head or your heart, but I can tell you what it looked like to the American people at the very minimum, an incompetence tsunami. And they're thinking how did these guys make it through the birth canal? That's all I got, Mr. Chair. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Just to--to put a fine point on this and we'll let you go, Mr. McCabe, thank you for coming. Did you have regular meetings with the people in charge of Crossfire Hurricane? 
MCCABE: We had regular meetings. We had impromptu meetings. There were a--a lot of meetings, senator. 
GRAHAM: You took it seriously. Is that correct? 
MCCABE: I think everybody took it seriously. 
GRAHAM: Okay. So, was Peter Strzok your main source of information? 
MCCABE: Peter Strzok was one of many sources of information. I met very regularly with Mr. Steinbach, Mr. Priestap, our general counsel, deputy general counsel. There--there were quite a few people involved at that level. 
GRAHAM: Did they tell you that the sub-source was being interviewed in January? 
MCCABE: I did know that the sub-source had been interviewed, that's correct. 
GRAHAM: Did you ever ask the question how did that interview go? Did it help us with a warrant application? Did it undermine the warrant application? Did you ask any questions about the results of the interview? 
MCCABE: I did. I remember discussing it very briefly, and I had not-- 
GRAHAM: --Who--who-- 
MCCABE: --Was not informed of any concerns with-- 
GRAHAM: --Who--thank you-- 
MCCABE: --Any significant concerns with the things that the-- 
GRAHAM: --Yeah. Yeah-- 
MCCABE: --Witness told them. 
GRAHAM: Who did you talk to about the interview, do you recall? 
MCCABE: I do not recall, sir. 
GRAHAM: So, you remember being told about that you--were you told about the March interview? 
MCCABE: No, sir. 
GRAHAM: So, here's the question, I guess. If you ask them how did the interview go and nobody tells you that it basically destroyed the dossier, if that's not criminal, is it grossly negligent not to get that information to you? 
MCCABE: I think that the case team should have had much more detailed conversation within themselves and also with the department attorneys who were writing the FISA warrant. 
GRAHAM: Is--is the blame--is the-- 
MCCABE: --Senator, I think the--the information that they included in the FISA package about that interview, albeit wildly misleading, I think it reflects how they thought about the interview at that time. And I think they didn't think about it critically enough. 
GRAHAM: If you--if you look at this interview and you're not wowed by how unreliable the dossier is, you don't want to see it as being unreliable. Now, you're in charge, the number two guy, of one of the most consequential investigations in the history of the FBI. It begins to fall apart. One stop sign after another is presented to the FBI. 
The CIA tells the FBI that this is Internet rumor. You need to watch Christopher Steele. The State Department talks about him trying to take Trump down. Bruce Ohr talks about you need to watch this guy. When the sub-source is actually interviewed, he shreds the document as being reliable. And nothing seemed to work. When it came to making sure that the true facts got out to the court and others, nothing seemed to work. Can you give me an explanation as to why, when it came to the exculpatory part of this, nothing seemed to work the way it should? 
MCCABE: Senator, I can only rely on the findings I have read in the IG report. And the IG-- 
GRAHAM: --But you were--you were the number two guy. You were in charge of all of this. How is it possible that the number two guy in the FBI was not informed about these major breakdowns regarding the reliability of the dossier? How is it--how--how did you--were you not in--reformed about the email from the CIA saying, yeah, actually Carter Page, he was a source for us? 
MCCABE: Senator, I can't answer for you why I did not know something at the time. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Well, that's the--that's the-- 
MCCABE: --I can't comment on it. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. That's the purpose of the hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to make sure that we find answers to how the system failed so it doesn't fail again. And I appreciate you coming. I'm sorry I didn't give you a break. 
And we will continue. In spite of my Democratic colleagues protestations, we're going to find somebody accountable for something when it comes to Crossfire Hurricane. And thank you very much, Mr. McCabe, for participating in the hearing. I appreciate it very, very much and wish you the best. 
MCCABE: Thank you. 
GRAHAM: All right. Now, as to why I'm doing what I'm doing, it's just astonishing to me that so much was ignored so often, and you come to the conclusion that there is no there--there. So, what do we know? 
We know that no defensive briefing was given to President Trump about concerns regarding his campaign. But when there were concerns regarding the Clinton campaign and foreign influence, she was briefed. We know that Senator Feinstein was briefed when the FBI thought maybe a member of our staff was connected to the Chinese intelligence community. 
All of these investigations of the Trump campaign were counterintelligence investigation--investigations. No one mentioned(PH) to President Trump ""You may have a problem with Papadopoulos."" Well, if you look at the transcripts of the--of the--the--the Barr talk with Mr. Papadopoulos, he says in the transcripts--he didn't even know he was being recorded--that, no, he's not working with the Russians. He hasn't received any information from Russia. That would be treason. That would be a crime. 
The whole premise of Crossfire Hurricane was a report by an Australian ambassador to the United Kingdom that was given to somebody in our office in London. That makes its way back to Washington. They've got all this information where Papadopoulos denies working with the Russians and they just plow ahead. 
Compare that to the September CIA memo to the FBI suggesting that Hillary Clinton has signed off on a plan to link Trump to Russia to draw attention away from her email server problem. This is our CIA telling the FBI they have credible information and investigative lead that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, is trying to link Trump to Russia for political purposes. And the FBI completely ignored it, apparently threw it in the garbage can, and considered a Australian ambassador meeting in a bar more reliable, didn't give it one minute of attention. And the reason that's important, it begins to explain how this all happened. 
Christopher Steele was on the payroll of Fusion GPS, who was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. Christopher Steele was working for the Democratic Party. He provided a dossier that used a Russian source who was suspected of being a Russian agent years before, and it turned out to be a bunch of garbage. 
So, the reason the FBI should have looked at what the CIA had told them is it begins to make Crossfire Hurricane make more sense, that this whole thing was cooked up in July, that the whole idea of Trump-Russia connections were not real. They were manufactured in part by Christopher Steele. And the FBI bought it hook, line, and sinker. 
So, I think a lot of us on our side are just astonished that, when the CIA sends over information to the FBI that they have intelligence that Hillary Clinton signed off on a plan to connect Trump to Russia to divert attention from her, that nobody at the FBI did a damn thing about it. Well, who did they send it to? Peter Strzok. 
Are you going to have me believe that Peter Strzok was fair-minded when it came to Trump-Clinton? Doesn't it make a lot of sense that the person who hated Trump, thought he should lose 100 million to nothing, thought he was an idiot, totally invested in making sure he never becomes president, is it very far-fetched to say that when he got the information about Clinton, he just purposely did nothing with it? 
How do you explain a system this out of control? The most high profile case maybe in the history of the FBI, at least at the top, that when the sub-source is interviewed on two separate occasions and the information is damning to the dossier, exculpatory in nature, it never makes its way up to anybody who actually signed the warrant. What kind of oversight existed for this to happen? How serious were they about checks and balances? Why didn't they go to Trump and do for Trump what they did for Clinton? ""We think you may have a problem. You need to correct it."" 
It's pretty obvious to us that Crossfire Hurricane started basically with a conversation in a bar. It took on a life well beyond what the evidence would require, that every time it was supposed to come to an end it kept going. Every time they received from--some information that made the whole premise of the case unreliable, they ignored it. 
When it comes to General Flynn and January the 4th, the professionals wanted to close out the case against General Flynn because there was no there--there, it was the seventh floor that kept going. They tricked General Flynn into talking without a lawyer, without going to the White House. Sally Yates said they should have defensively briefed the president if they had a concern with General Flynn. They chose not to. They set him up and acted very dishonorably toward General Flynn. 
And there's nothing wrong with General Flynn talking to the ambassador of the--Russia when he's the incoming national security advisor. And the conversations are recorded, and there's not one word in there to suggest that General Flynn had been an agent of the Russians at any time. And they've basically tried to ruin the man's reputation. The professionals, January the 4th, took a hard look at General Flynn and found nothing there. It's just these people at the top who had an insane desire to keep looking at Trump people when the evidence which is--suggests they needed to stop. 
What did they never stop when it came to Trump when they should have stopped? Why did they never slow down? Because they had a bias. They really were in the tank when it came to--to Trump being a Russian agent no matter what the evidence said. They were going after this guy because in their mind he wasn't worthy. Why did they not look at the allegations against candidate Clinton provided by the CIA? It would undercut the narrative. 
This wasn't an investigation that was unbiased. This was an investigation that was out of control. The people in charge of it were deeply biased. Their actions prove more than any--more than any direct evidence of their bias. Every time they had a moment to reflect, they--they moved forward. Every time exculpatory information was provided, they ignored it or altered it criminally. 
It's no accident to the American--it's no accident, in my view, that all this happened. This is not a series of random mistakes. This was a concerted effort to keep an investigation going that should have stopped, that should have slowed down. And what's the damage done? 
They manipulated the FISA court to keep a warrant process going that should've stopped months ago. They created a cloud over the FBI about political bias that lingers to this day. Lawyers are being prosecuted for manipulating evidence to keep a warrant application alive. They were told about information from the CIA that maybe this was all part of a political scheme of the opponent. They ignored it. 
They knew that the Christopher Steele dossier was suspect. They knew that the source was a prior Russian--suspected Russian agent and they kept going and going and going, and they never at one moment gave President Trump a briefing that every other candidate should expect. If you think somebody in my office is doing something wrong, I would like for you to tell me so I can fix it. 
They weren't trying to protect Trump. They weren't trying to protect his campaign from foreign influence. They were trying to undercut the president. They were trying to keep an investigation going against a president--a candidate that they despised. They had one standard for Trump vastly different than that of candidate Clinton. And my Democratic colleagues say let's move on. 
To this day years later, I have yet to find one person who will take responsibility for manipulating the FISA court. I didn't know. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have signed it. So, who are we to blame? Is it somebody at the bottom of the pyramid who had all this exculpatory information and for some reason didn't share it? Is that what the system's come down to, blaming somebody at the bottom? 
They take responsibility in name only. They don't seem to appreciate the gravity of damage done to the FBI and to the investigative process when they say, no, of course I wouldn't have signed that warrant. These are the people, Comey and McCabe, Rob Rosenstein and Yates, who are actually in charge of gathering the information. They're in charge of the investigative part of obtaining a FISA warrant. They gather the facts and the lawyers the DOJ decide whether or not to pursue a warrant. 
The people in charge of this investigation were notified by the CIA that this may have been a plot cooked up by the Democratic candidate to blame Trump for being involved in Russia when he wasn't. They completely ignored it. And when they were hit hard by the facts that the dossier was a bunch of garbage, it just magically never made it up to their desk. Everything bad about Trump made it to their desk. Everything exculpatory about the Trump campaign never made it to their desk. 
How dumb do they think we are? This committee is not through. We're going to keep digging until we find out how the most high profile investigation of a candidate for president of the United States and eventually a sitting president was handled so poorly and try to let the FISA court now that we take our job seriously. So, we will continue this process. 
People need to be fired, and I think the criminality here needs to be looked at. I find it very difficult to believe that this exculpatory information was not withheld from the court on purpose. We know Clinesmith changed exculpatory information. We caught him. There's somebody else out there that probably knows the system rejected the exculpatory information. They just didn't ignore it. To be continued. Thank you. The hearing is adjourned. "

[*]LOWEY: I'll say good morning, again. I call this meeting of the Committee on Appropriations to order. 
Before we begin, House rules now require me to remind you that we have set up an email address to which members can send anything they wish to submit in writing, at any of our hearings, or markups. That email address has been provided to your staff. 
Our first order of business, today, is consideration of the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year, 2021. 
I will now recognize Mr. Visclosky to present the bill. 
VISCLOSKY: Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. Before I begin my remarks on the fiscal year 2021 bill, I reluctantly have to acknowledge that this will be my final opening statement, before the House Appropriations Committee. 
To paraphrase President Truman, I have no new revelations to make. But for those of you who will remain on this committee, there are simply a few things I would like to say. And I'm saying them as someone who is so compulsive, he saved the Congressional Record, from the day he was appointed to this committee, after six years, nine months and nine days of effort, which makes Mr. Rogers, my good friend, the only person in this room, who has served longer, either as an associate staff or member on this esteemed committee. 
I first want to make the observation that I am an appropriator to my core. When people asked my father, who lived to be a hundred and one, what he did with his life, he said, ""I played politics."" If someone asks me that, later in life, I'm going to say, ""I was an appropriator."" I did start as an associate staff in January of 1977. And I would point out, we are a unique committee. If the work of this committee is not completed, there is no government of the United States of America. 
We're the ones who are charged with funding and oversight of the entire government and to ensure that it is as effective and as efficient, as possible. However, in some ways, the committee is at the (INAUDIBLE), in terms of its ability to achieve bipartisan solutions. In part, this is due to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which some members of this committee did vote for. If we only cut discretionary spending, we could balance the budget. 
Currently, mandatory spending and interest on the debt represents 70 percent of the money spent, each year, by the federal government. Discretionary spending, as we all know, is 30 percent. As Mr. Womack, I think, as Mr. Calvert and others have pointed out in other markups, we must deal with mandatory spending for future generations, for budget integrity. And I think, most importantly, there will be no money left to appropriate, if we don't deal with this issue and every appropriation dollar is an investment in this country. 
When less than 30 percent of young Americans aren't qualified to join the military, we need to invest in health, in education, in infrastructure, in jobs. But we also need to deal with revenue. In the year 2000, the last year the federal government had a surplus, revenues, as a percentage of GDP, were 20 percent. In fiscal year 2019, revenues were 16.3 percent. And again, we need a certain amount of revenue to invest in this good and great country. 
And finally, there's a couple of notes. One, never say something is above my pay grade. Every time that has been said in this committee, I cringe because we are appropriators. No one is above your pay grade. We may need other people to get something done but nothing is above the pay grade of this committee. 
Others have stood up and said, we can't authorize in this committee. I cringe. Why did you want to get on this committee? So, you could appropriate and, when appropriate and in conjunction with the authorizers, we can authorize. We have been asked by authorizers to authorize. And finally, there are great bills that come down the road. It could be the greatest environmental policy in the world. It could be the best Ag Bill in the world. But there's just this tiny bit of new mandatory spending, which the chairwoman has, repeatedly, talked about and tried to target. 
It's just a little bit of mandatory spending. That's how we have gotten to 70 percent of no control over the budget. So, the next time we have a vote in this Congress, or future congresses, think it through. I do thank you for that indulgence. And moving on to the bill, I need to also thank my Ranking Member, my friend, Mr. Calvert, for his continued commitment to being collegial, transparent and bipartisan. I cannot overrate the value of his friendship and the partnership we have. And I also want to express my gratitude to Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger. We would not be here, without their leadership and help. Ms. Granger chaired this subcommittee in the last Congress. And also, because this will be Nita's last markup. I cannot thank you enough for a dedicated life of service to leaving this world a little bit better. 
Nita, I really, really respect you. Thank you very much. I also do want to thank every member of our subcommittee. It is a joy to work with you, regardless of where you sit in that room. And I want to thank the subcommittee staff, particularly, our clerks, Becky Leggieri and Johnnie Kaberle, as well as the associate staff for their hard work. And I would also want to recognize the 2020 Military Fellows for their contributions. Having to assemble the bulk of the bill and report, remotely, increased the degree of difficulty, substantially, as it has for all of the subcommittees. I commend them for their professionalism and acumen. 
This legislation does recognize the complex challenges the members of our Armed Forces and intelligence community face every day, throughout the world. And it aims to ensure that they are able to continue to meet these challenges and complete their missions to the best of their abilities. I do think it's important to highlight several investments. 
One is $758 million in procurement for COVID recovery for second, third and fourth tier suppliers. This has been of particular interest to Mr. Calvert. He has been dogged on the issue. And I would ask any member, they have constituents, or companies, int heir district that meet that classification and, somehow, that relief has not made it to them, you have got to let us know. I'm not, necessarily, worried about the people at the top. I'm worried about their lower tier suppliers and their employees. So, if there's a problem in your district, we do want to know. But in addition to this funding, the legislation places several reporting requirements on the Department, specific to COVID-19. The budgetary impacts of the pandemic on the Department are still, largely, undetermined. Some programs will cost more. 
However, there will be savings obtained, through delayed, or cancelled events, or activities. It is imperative that the committee and Congress have as much detail, as possible, to delegate funding and to conduct oversight. And most importantly, the bill continues to focus on the well-being and morale of those in uniform and their families and DoD civilians and their communities. The bill provides an additional $116 million for upgrades to childcare facilities and the report contains language, directing the military services to present innovative ideas to address the serious backlog for childcare. 
The bill provides $1.49 billion for environmental restoration activities, which is $415 million, above the request. 
The bill and report take steps to stop the Department from closing military treatment facilities and from reducing military healthcare billets. These plans were poorly justified to the committee, prior to the pandemic, and even harder to defend, under current conditions. 
The bill provides $327 million to address the ongoing epidemic of sexual assault in the military and at the service academies, which is $49 million more than requested. And I must express my personal upset, over this issue. Most recent report on the sexual assault rate for women has jumped a shocking 50 percent, from 2016 to 2018. And despite dire warnings, the Department's budget for sexual assault prevention and response remains stagnant. And I would also say, it is not just a question of money. Year after year after year, we have testimony from officials, who contend that they are really committed to solving this problem. And we are going backwards. 
And so, the Department has got to do a much better job. 
The bill, again, contains several provisions to reign in the Department's now, habitual redirection of funding and contravention of congressional intent. I'm not going to rehash the arguments to why I believe the Department's actions are unlawful. However, I do want to express my upset with how these actions have, irreparably, damaged the Department's credibility with the committee. 
One DoD official, in a meeting, likely, referred to these transfers of billions of dollars as anomalies. These are just anomalies. I refer to them as habitual abuses, by the Department. In recent years, the Department leadership has not missed an opportunity to claim that a 3 percent to 5 percent annual rule growth in the defense budget is necessary to support the National Defense Strategy. But at the same time, those same leaders facilitated the transfer of nearly $10 billion to non-defense activities, not enumerated in their own National Defense Strategy. And while this was happening, they also have the temerity to, repeatedly, request more flexibility from Congress for executing their budget and for reprogramming authorities. 
The sense of entitlement in these actions is galling and I hope that, at some point, the Department will have the leadership in place, who recognizes Congress's constitutional prerogative and restore trust to the appropriations process. 
In closing, I would like, again, to reiterate what a profound privilege it has been to serve on this committee. I, again, want to thank my chair, ranking member and all of the members, who have logged so many hard hours in making this bill possible. 
And I would ask for your support. And I yield back my time. 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize the subcommittee Ranking Member, Mr. Calvert. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Visclosky. Before I begin my statement, I would like to thank Chairwoman Lowey for your many years of dedicated service. The way you've led this committee is an example to all of us and your district and our country. 
We're a better place because of your service. I wish you all the happiness, on your retiring. 
I would also like to thank our Full Committee, Ranking Member, Kay Granger, for her leadership on this bill, a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform. And I very much appreciate her insight and input. 
Chairman Visclosky, it's hard to believe that this is your last full committee defense appropriations markup. It's been an honor to work with you in what is a true partnership, dedicated to ensuring our national security. 
I gave a very touching and elegant and eloquent tribute to the Chairman, during our subcommittee markup. But that's classified, so, I can't repeat it, here. Plus, I know how uncomfortable Pete is for having a spotlight on him. He does not seek credit, or attention, for the work he does for our service members and their family. He does it because it's the right thing to do. The chairman has done more to advance these issues than, almost, anyone. And his legacy will be felt for generations. 
You know, we have a tradition, our committee, which is extremely non-partisan. It is our duty to provide for the best quality of life for the men and women, who serve in the United States military, and provide the best equipment and materials that they have to make sure that, if we ever get in a fight, it's not a fair fight. And that's something that should not be controversial, nor partisan. And personally, I'll miss your friendship and I'll, know, though, that you'll just be one little Zoom call away. So, I look forward to talking to you, from time to time. 
It's important to recognize the, also, the chairman's Deputy Chief of Staff, Joe Devooght. Joe is the Chairman's right hand, has been an essential part of his defense team, for many years. Just like his boss, Joe doesn't like the spotlight on him but it's appropriate to recognize all his hard work to our--to better our national security and to help our service members and their families. 
The bill before us today provides funding for many key programs that are essential to our security, consistent with the National Defense Strategy and its focus on the great power competition with China and Russia. 
The bill will enhance our national security capabilities, by furthering additional fifth generation combat aircraft, ships and additional submarines, while, also, providing the combatant commands, the resources they have requested, including the M29, a critical ISR capability. The bill also will continue to invest in research and development of new technologies, essential to maintaining U.S. military superiority. 
It's important for everyone on this committee to recognize that, because of our investments in DARPA, they started investing in advanced technologies and research for pandemic prevention, back in 2002. So, a lot of the progress that has been made was because of their hard work and, also, what we're doing to begin testing. COVID has many impacts, throughout the Department of Defense. I've been, especially, concerned about the impact, as the chairman mentioned, on second, third and fourth suppliers. I want to thank the chairman for including funds to help mitigate that damage to the suppliers. Their work is vital to our national security and we must do everything within our power to make--to protect those jobs. 
I'm also pleased that the focus on providing for the health and welfare of our men and women in uniform reflects the longstanding concerns of so many of our members of defense health programs, sexual assault prevention, suicide prevention. And we include strong oversight for electronic health records management, which I know Chairman Rogers is extremely interested in, along with all the rest of us. 
These are all examples of critical investments in this bill. And I strongly support. That's why it is so unfortunate that important initiatives that have broad support, overshadowed by political issues. The importance of getting this bill done on time cannot be overstated. According to a DoD comptroller, a continuing resolution wastes, roughly, $1.7 billion, a month, through the inability to sign contracts, delays in production, other draw downstream expense. 
This year, a CR would halt many of the modernization priorities that are vital to maintaining our military superiority, over near peer threats, such as China and Russia. This is no way to run the most sophisticated and professional fighting force in the world. There are, currently, over 200,000 U.S. service members deployed, around the world, ensuring that threats never meet our shores. They do their job, every day. There's no allowance for a pause or a break. They do what we ask. And it's time Congress does what is necessary and required in the U.S. Constitution and provide for the common defense of our nation in a timely and consistent manner. 
Mr. Chairman, while this is a very strong bill, there are numerous provisions, like the prohibition on funding for the southwest border wall construction and limitations on DoD's general and special transfer authorities that will draw a veto threat from the administration. It is important that this bill becomes law, as soon as possible. While I cannot support it in its current form, I want to work with you, so we can have a bill that can be signed, when it gets to the president's desk because there's always a lot of things are going to happen between now and then. I certainly want to thank the staff, my personal staff, the subcommittee staff, both on the majority and the minority, for their hard work and look forward to getting this bill done. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize myself for opening remarks. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to recognize my dear friend and colleague, Chairman Visclosky. Sadly, this is his last defense markup. 
Pete grew up in a household in Gary, focused on public service. From his time as a staffer to being elected in 1984, no one has fought harder for the people of Indiana, and the need to domestically manufacture products. 
Our country is stronger, as a result of his advocacy for steelworkers, and Pete is a model of dedication, integrity, intelligence, and honor. 
As I mentioned in my subcommittee remarks, the lives of our service members are better because of your leadership. I especially thank you for your partnership, during my time as Ranking Member and Chairwoman of the Committee. We will miss you. We wish you the very best. I wish you lots of happiness in your next chapter of your life. Thank you. 
Turning to the bill before us today, I thank Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Calvert for their work and commend the subcommittee staff for their long hours and dedication. As we continue to process the devastating physical, psychological, and economic impact of this pandemic, we are reminded that safety and security are fragile. We know that we live in a dangerous world, but also recognize that the choices we make to stay safe need to be reasonable and responsible. 
This bill provides the Defense Department with the appropriate level of resources to address an evolving threat landscape and to ensure the security of our nation and our allies. It ensures that our servicemembers are well-trained and equipped and that they are prepared for future military needs. We have the most capable and advanced military in the world, and this bill honors their mission, by adequately funding programs to care for servicemembers and their families, and by including provisions to end the Trump Administration's theft of defense funds to pay for a wasteful border wall. 
Specifically, this bill strengthens national security with robust funding to support ongoing operations and maintenance of existing assets. It procures the latest military systems, while investing in research and development needed for future capabilities, especially the growing needs of cyberspace. It provides support for our allies and defense partners. I applaud the subcommittee for including provisions that prohibit explosive nuclear weapons testing. Collectively, these investments bring safety to our nation and our forces. 
The bill also ensures a higher quality of life for our service members and their families, including access to medical care and an increase in important health initiatives and research. It supports the critical need for childcare and excellent schools for our military families. It also provides critical funding to address the scourge of sexual assault. Supporting our national security and finding reasonable and responsible common ground is a bipartisan issue. I hope we will enact a final bill that reflects that tradition. 
So, I congratulate Chairman Visclosky on an excellent bill and urge support. 
I would now like to recognize Ranking Member Granger for her opening remarks. 
GRANGER: Thank you for yielding. Before I begin my remarks about the defense bill, I, like the others, want to take a moment to recognize the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Visclosky. As he mentioned, I had the honor of working, closely, with him, when I chaired Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
Chairman Visclosky is one of a kind. His passion and commitment to our service men and women and their families is absolute. 
He serves with dignity, with modesty and with determination. Like Nita Lowey, he's also a joy to work with. He leaves behind an extraordinary legacy and he will be greatly missed. I also want to thank my friend, Ken Calvert, for the outstanding job he's doing, leading this subcommittee, as our ranking member. You can't find anyone more committed to our national security. Providing funding for our nation's defense is one of the most important roles the founders gave to Congress. I know the chairman, the ranking member take this responsibility, as seriously as I do. Turning to the bill before us, first, I'm very pleased to see the chairman has focused on imported procurement funding that is so essential for our security. 
The bill also prioritizes healthcare and quality of life issues, which have significant impacts on readiness. We must make sure that DoD and the services stay focused on these issues. He also brought up the sexual assault and the progress that hasn't been made. We'll continue to do even more with that, in years to come. I appreciate the chairman including many Republican priorities and I'm thankful for his efforts and those of the committee staff. Unfortunately, I have concerns with several policy writers in the bill that will prevent me from supporting it, at this time. 
This bill must become law and I am concerned that many of the provisions would draw a veto threat. 
These provisions include limiting funds to construct a wall or fence at the border, renaming military installations, exempting the Ukraine security assistance initiative for the normal OMB process and continuing to limit DoD's budget flexibility. 
We'll have to drop or modify any controversial language that could jeopardize this bill's chances of being signed into law. It's too important for that. We must provide our troops with the funds they need to defend our nation. This bill is simply too important to be slowed down by politics. 
I thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Are there any other members wishing to make general comments about the bill? 
CLERK: Mr. Pocan seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Mr. Pocan. 
POCAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. And first of all, let me say to our subcommittee chair, thank you for your many, many years of service. I really enjoyed working with you on this committee and I know there are many important parts of this bill that wouldn't have been there, if it wasn't for your efforts and the subcommittee staff efforts. 
And I do want to say thank you. 
I do rise though, today, to say that I wish the Defense Appropriations Bill were smaller. I know that this bill was written to the authorization levels set in the NDAA and I'll continue to do everything in my power to ensure lower NDAA authorization levels. That is why I've never voted in favor of an NDAA on the House floor. Our defense spending is 90 times what we spend on the CDC. And we all recognize, during this pandemic, that that is not serving what most people would consider to be our nation's greatest threat, right now. 
But we don't set those levels of defense spending in the appropriations bill. We do that in the NDAA. And that's where I'll continue to have that fight. We also will debate and, hopefully, include three important antiwar provisions, today, to sunset the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs and prohibit any funds to be used towards a war with Iran. 
I think these are important debates we should be having that may not, otherwise, happen with the NDAA. And I will support these efforts and am proud to be working with my colleague, Representative Barbara Lee, to cut the NDAA authorization levels by 10 percent, for next year. It is my hope that our effort to lower the NDAA will be successful and that, when this committee drafts next year's Defense Appropriations Bill, it will be tethered to a dramatically reduced NDAA authorization level. 
I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Rogers is recognized. 
ROGERS: Thank the chair for yielding. Madam Chair, there's two reasons I wanted to speak, briefly. One is to pay tribute to the outgoing chairman of the Subcommittee, who has served his country so very well, in any number of ways. As you know, he served here on staff, before coming a member, himself. But he enjoys deep and widespread respect and admiration from members, across the--across the scene of the House and the Senate. So, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your service and we wish you all the best in your new chapter that you are starting to write. 
The second reason I wanted to speak briefly was to, personally, thank chairman and Ranking Member, Mr. Calvert, for putting strong language in the bill, regarding the DoD electronic health record and attempt to link both VA and HUD to the same Internet service, so as to prevent misgivings that may occur because of the inability of those two systems to talk to each other. As many of you are aware, I've been working on this measure with the committee for, probably, 11 or 12 years now, or more, because of a young man in my district who lost his sight because the VA could not get into his DoD records from an injury in the Mid-East. And he lost his sight. 
That was my first exposure to this problem. I know that that would not happen today and we're now closer to full interoperability between the DoD and VA, than we've ever been. But I've heard that same refrain, year after year, agency to agency, for more than a decade, which is why we must maintain strong oversight of the progress of DoD and VA and demand accountability. As the DoD and VA electronic health record systems begin full deployment, it's essential that we, as a committee, to keep our finger on the pulse of the situation and ensure that this program reaches the finish line in a timely fashion. 
This bill that you have written does just that. It's very strong oversight of DOD. And we're getting the same results from the subcommittee that funds VA. So, I think we're on the right track, but we've got to keep on it time in and time out, to be sure that the bureaucracies don't finally win the battle, which they have, so far. So, I think you for your great service in general and I thank you, especially, you and Mr. Calvert, for the very strong oversight language you have in your bill. 
Thank you, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Just briefly, I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Rogers, for bringing this issue up, once again. 
We have been a powerful team and many on this committee have been working with us. It is outrageous that it has cost so many millions on such an important issue and they still can't get it done. So, although I am leaving this committee, I am counting on you, my good friend, to keep your oversight done. We can't afford not to make sure that our veterans, our people who have served our country, have the very best healthcare that we have a responsibility to provide. So, I thank you for bringing that up. And I'm happy to yield to Ms. McCollum. 
MCCOLLUM: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of this bill. And I'd like to thank you and Ranking Member Calvert for your tremendous work on this, including all the work that the staff put into it. This legislation is filled with important measures that will keep our servicemembers safe, our nation secure and the industrial base of our country strong, particularly, as we deal with COVID-19 pandemic. 
Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank you for your continued commitment to environmental remediation and protection in this bill, including the ongoing crisis of PFOS and PFOA contamination at current and former military installations. Most of us in this room have a military installation in our district, or our state and additional funding for service environmental remediation accounts, as well as well as for formerly used defense sites is critical to keeping our servicemembers, families and our surrounding communities healthy and safe. I'm also pleased to see that this bill provides robust funding for defense health programs and medical research that's so important to our military families and to the health of our nation. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to end by thanking you for your years of service in Congress and on this committee. And as I said earlier in subcommittee, markup, but it wasn't classified so, I'm going to repeat it. I'm from Minnesota. And in Minnesota, we often refer to a North Star. Mr. Chair, you have been a North Star for me in leadership and in teaching me how to be a better chair on the Environment Interior Committee. 
Your way of conducting this committee to embrace members and make everyone feel important, leaves me speechless, at times. And so, Mr. Chair, I'm going to continue what you taught me and that is, not always speaking first, or going first is important. Sometimes, it's the last word in the close that's important. 
Mr. Chair, I wish you all the success in the years to come. And thank you for the work that you did on the bill before us, today. 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize Ms. Kaptur for her remarks. 
KAPTUR: Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to add my words of thanks to our valued Great Lakes colleague, Chairman Visclosky, whose friendship, acumen and true leadership over four decades, I personally, will miss, dearly. Also, knowing the region that he has been privileged to represent and the downdraft on the economy there for so many decades, his endurance is truly remarkable. 
Ranking Member Calvert, Chair Lowey and Ranking Member Grainger and our extraordinary staff, thank you all for your leadership, too, in a year of overwhelming demand and challenge. I want to applaud the chairman for his commitment to preserve the important balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. Chair Visclosky has always put those who serve and protect our constitutional rights, first. He has, once again, asserted the need to restrict efforts that shortchange their security for political purposes. 
This bill meets the challenge of the reemergence of revisionist powers, without neglecting the ongoing terrorist and hotspot threats. It modernizes our forces and their capabilities. It provides robust investment in research and development, as well as appropriate procurement. In this year of COVID-19 and political unrest, our servicemembers have been called upon to assist domestic missions, in addition to global security postures. I applaud the chairman's support to America's industrial base, further harmed by COVID's economic impact. 
America will benefit by provisions addressing workforce readiness, research, development and testing of hypersonic capabilities and cyber security enhancements. 
The bill continues our commitment to undergird America's democratic alliances and meet serious threats to it. The bill incorporates provisions to address hybrid threats, such as in Ukraine and advances priorities to ensure America's global leadership and security in an evolving threat environment. Similarly, this nation cannot focus on total force, without contemplating the strength and readiness of our young people to enter military service, or the military industrial base industry. 
This bill reflects that reality. It includes an increase in funds for the National Guard Bureau's counter drug program, a supportive relationship many of our communities rely upon, particularly, those hardest hit, as America grapples with how to reduce the severity and impact of our nation's opioid epidemic. Importantly, it bolsters support for youth workforce and preparedness programs, including in the National Guards Youth Challenge Program and Starbase. 
Lastly, as I mentioned, it funds our most important defense asset, our servicemembers. The bill includes funds for defense health research in much-needed areas, particularly, traumatic brain injury and neuropsychological health. It calls on the Department to establish a means to develop a baseline for reference of cognitive brain health for every service member. 
Again, Chairman Visclosky, we appreciate you so very much, Ranking Member and the committee staff for diligently working to incorporate these priorities and many others and wish our Chairman the enjoyable retirement and new purposing that I know he would do, when he leaves us and he richly so deserves those years. 
Your father is smiling on you. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. DeLauro is recognized. 
DELAURO: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I want to recognize and celebrate our distinguished colleague and departing Chair, Congressman Pete Visclosky. A lifelong Hoosier, Chairman Visclosky has served in the Congress for three decades. 
In that time, he has fought for Americans' jobs, for American defense, for American men and women. I want to commend him for his leadership of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. And Congressman Visclosky, I want to thank you for your kind cooperation and your steadfast commitment to defense, to the well-being of our nation and its citizens and for understanding the balance between national readiness and the well-being, healthcare of our men and women in uniform and their families. 
Just an inside, over just the last few days of sitting next to each other here, Pete and I have talked about our families. He talked about his dad in politics and passing away at 101. My mom passed away, just a couple years ago, at 103. And at the basis of what they were about and what they passed on to us was the value of politics and how it gets you where you need and want to be, so that you can affect change and so forth. So, would that we would have these conversations more with one another, regularly. 
Connecticut has long been known as the Arsenal Republic and, again and again, Chairman Visclosky, throughout his time as both chair and ranking member, has tried to help me help my state and its workers. For him, it was a team effort. We were in this together, always open to feedback, to suggestions and to requests. 
The bill before us, especially appreciative of the CH-53 case, a full funding. And he always looks at me and he doesn't even say, Rosa. He just says helicopters. And full funding for continued development. These dollars are critical to preserving the production ramp, decreasing cost and ensuring supplier stability and jobs. I also have to say word about the defense health programs. So many of you know that I am a survivor of ovarian cancer and $35 million for ovarian cancer research, deeply personal to me and critical to improving prevention, early diagnosis and survival rates. 
About 21,750 women will receive a new diagnosis, this year, of ovarian cancer. About almost 14,000 will die from ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in the cancer deaths, among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. So, let me close by thanking the chairman for his leadership, over the years. It's been an honor to work with you. Yours is a career that is indicative of informed and thoughtful work translates into effect of public policy. Yours is a chairmanship that is proof that our national defense advances the well-being of our national family and of its members. 
Thank you and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Price is recognized. 
PRICE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to join in the course of tributes to Chairman Visclosky, Ranking Member Calvert, for the collaborative process that has produced a very fine bill, this year. Thanks too, to the subcommittee staff on both sides your dedication and hard work. 
These tributes to Pete Visclosky our heartfelt and I want to add my word of thanks and commendation for our long service together in the House and on this committee. We go way back on this Appropriations Committee. We were appointed at about the same time, as part of an interesting process to secure appointment. Pete has worked, tirelessly, on this committee. And I particularly appreciate his words this morning. And I know this committee means to him and his identity as a member of the House. Those words are well chosen, and he's lived up to them. Nobody understands better than Pete Visclosky, the power of the purse. The key article on power in the Constitution of this House, in which we serve. And nobody is more vigilant about the many ways, large and small, that that power may be challenged, or eroded. 
So, I thank him for his words of wisdom and even more for working on this subcommittee to be effective, to be bipartisan, to operate in a way that preserves that power of the purse and enhances it. It really is key to our institutional future and nobody has been more attentive to that, than Pete Visclosky. There's one provision in this bill that I, particularly, want to express my appreciation for. Last year's NDAA included an authorization for the World Language Advancement and Readiness Grant Program, which Representative Don Young and I championed, as part of a wider bipartisan effort. 
The NDAA authorized DoD to award three-year competitive grants to Department of Defense education activity schools and to local education agencies that host a Junior ROTC program. These grants can be used for the establishment, improvement and expansion of world language programs in elementary and secondary schools. The future national security and economic well-being of the U.S. will depend, substantially, on the ability of our citizens to write, read and speak and understand the languages and cultures of other nations. 
Unfortunately, there are plenty of evidence that, as the GAO said, by several measures, the United States has neglected languages in its educational curricula, it's international strategies and its domestic policies. The U.S. puts itself at a disadvantage in our ability to communicate with our international peers. And how do you learn languages? The critical window--lots of research shows this--the critical window for language learning is from ages 10 to 18. So, that makes investment in our elementary and secondary schools a top priority. 
Language comprehension isn't just a luxury. It's vital to our economic interest, to our diplomacy and to our national security. So, I want to thank the chair and ranking member for including $15 million to stand up the new World Language Advancement and Readiness Grant Program, as well as report language requiring an implementation plan. 
Thank you, again, for your work, your dedication of this committee and its mission. 
LOWEY: Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, I want to associate myself with the remarks of Chairman Visclosky. Whenever, because he is a man of few words, whenever he does take the opportunity to speak, outside of the normal, the normal course of our discussions, I always take the time to listen because he spends a lot of time thinking through things, listening. He's thoughtful and his observations are really always on point. 
Today, was no exception. I've had the privilege of serving on this committee, since my second term in Congress. And the adage, which I know many of us can heed carefully, is to talk less and listen more. And he is really, he really exemplifies that characteristic. I'm especially appreciative of his--the importance of you underscoring that the Appropriations Committee is unique and special. And that we, too often, of late, have forgotten our culture, which I learned when I first came, which is that we are, there are Democrats, Republicans and appropriators. 
And that this committee has always been endeavored and should continue to endeavor to work closely together, across the aisle. And that's why we always hear between our subcommittee chairs, the accolades and the comradery and the collegiality. We just need to make sure that we, as we will no longer serve with you in the present, that we heed your advice and remember the importance and significance of this committee and make sure that we fight for it because that's incredibly important. We are the linchpin to the entire government continuing and making sure that we all are good stewards of that is important. And you have done that, repeatedly, and led by example. And I also want to take a moment to thank both you, Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Calvert, for your leadership on the bill before us. This is not an easy bill to manage. This is a bill that has controversy. This is a bill that is essential but, nevertheless, attracts a lot of strong feelings. 
But this bill is, above all else, important to make sure that we can protect the national security and the well-being of the American people. And it will help us keep our nation secure, take care of our service members and President Trump's theft of defense funds to pay for a xenophobic border wall. The best way to guarantee the safety and efficacy of our troops is to make sure that they are ready for new challenges. That's why the subcommittee provides $1.67 billion, above the request, for key readiness programs to prepare forces for combat operations and other peacetime missions. 
This bill provides the Defense Department with the resources necessary to address evolving and future threats, including the emerging risks that we face from cyber attacks. This bill will also improve the quality of life of all our service members and their families, by providing a 3 percent pay raise and increasing funding to military childcare facilities. To further the goal of eradicating military sexual assault and protect the safety, dignity and well-being of all members of the Armed Forces, this bill increases funding DoD's sexual assault prevention and response programs. We're also funding, potentially, life-saving science with a $512.5 million investment in peer review cancer research. And as a breast cancer survivor, that's incredibly important to me. 
I'm particularly glad that this bill funds and supports research for metastatic cancer. Here in the U.S., one person dies, every 13 minutes, from metastatic breast cancer and yet, it remains an understudied field. This bill will help us to develop the complex understanding necessary to fight the most advanced stage of cancer, by funding clinical trials that will reflect the demographics of the United States population. 
The bill will also help our military take steps to better reflect our American values by directing funding to the Army to pay for the renaming of installations, facilities, roads and streets that bear the name of Confederate leaders and officers. That is a provision that synergizes well for the provision in the military construction in VA appropriations bill that pushes bases to erase Confederate names. And further, as chair of that subcommittee, I'm pleased that this bill asserts our authority, as a coequal branch of government, by prohibiting funds from being diverted away from our troops and vital national security projects, in order to pay for the president's monument to racism, along the southern border. 
And notably, the bill also requires that any unobligated funds that were stolen to pay for the border wall in FY '20, be returned to their original accounts and used for the purposes that Congress intended. And finally, I appreciate how the bill includes nearly $1.5 billion for environmental restoration, including $15 million for an assessment to the health implications of PFOS and PFOA. 
The report also includes language that urges the Secretary of Defense to expedite the replacement of PFOS firefighting phones, by 2024. This is an issue I care deeply about because our committee has heard from veterans about the horrible and unexpected health problems that they and their families have likely suffered, due to PFOS water contamination. And I'm glad we're addressing that in both (INAUDIBLE) VA bill and this one. 
I look forward to seeing this bill come to the floor. Thank you, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LOWEY: Mr. Kilmer is recognized. 
KILMER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And before I begin, I want to thank you, Chairman Visclosky for your leadership on this subcommittee. You've been a consistent champion for maintaining and improving our national security and supporting our service members, who courageously volunteered to serve our country. And Mr. Chairman, I just want to echo everyone in acknowledging that your leadership will be missed, here. 
I also want to thank Ranking Member Calvert and, of course, all of the dedicated committee staff for the work on the fiscal year 2021, Defense Appropriations Bill. So, the Navy's the largest employer in the district I represent, and our region has seen firsthand the vital role that our nation's public shipyards play in supporting our national security interest. So, I'm really grateful that this bill includes funding for the Naval Facility Sustainment, Modernization and Restoration Program, to address the seismic and fire protection deficiencies at our public shipyards. 
We know that more will be needed in the years ahead to modernize our shipyards. But in addition to investing in these facilities, we also need to invest in the men and women who support our nation's shipyards. Unfortunately, the current administration has consistently worked to undermine the collective bargaining rights of our hard-working federal employees. And that's why I'm proud that this bill includes a provision I championed to, directly, combat anti-worker executive orders that have made it harder for federal employees to negotiate the paid benefits and working conditions that they have earned and that they deserve. 
Finally, we've got to support the communities that support our military. The chairman's mark includes $50 million for the Defense Community Infrastructure Program, which funds projects to address commuter workforce issues, schools and other local infrastructure that support military installations. These investments will help to improve the quality of life for our service members, their families and the civilian workforce that are the lifeblood of our defense communities. Additionally, supporting military communities means ensuring that the Navy is a good neighbor. And I'm proud that this bill continues to advance efforts to mitigate military jet noise, funding jet noise reduction technology and providing $50 million for new noise mitigation community partnership programs, which provide direct grants to support infrastructure upgrades for schools, hospitals and homes to mitigate impacts of excessive aircraft noise. 
These investments are critical to ensuring that the Navy can support critical training requirements for our aircrew, while also remaining a good neighbor to the folks living in surrounding communities. And I'm proud these priorities are reflected in the bill. And I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Thank you, Madam Chair and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Crist is recognized. 
CRIST: Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my strong support for the subcommittee's work. 
As members of Congress, I think our most important job is to keep America safe. This year's defense bill meets that commitment. With your leadership and that of Ranking Member Calvert, we have a product to be very proud of. The bill includes a number of provisions I was proud to work on with the chairman and staff. We boosted oversight of the new contract for moving services for military men and women, an important function, directly impacting the lives of our service members and their families. 
We also promoted greater access to classified contracting opportunities for small and nontraditional businesses, who face significant hurdles, when trying to share their innovations and expertise with the DoD. And we directed the Department to do a deep dive on new ways to help small businesses gain affordable access to secure skiffs, so more businesses can participate in the contracting process. And lastly, I want to thank the chairman, not just for his decades of hard work and dedication, as a staffer, of course, a member and, ultimately, as chairman of our subcommittee but for his friendship and his mentorship. 
Working with you has been an honor, sir. This committee is one of the last bastions of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill and its thanks, in large part, to your leadership but that important tradition continues today. 
In closing, I request all my colleagues to support the underlying report and bill and I yield back. Thank you. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cole is recognized. 
COLE: That you very much, Madam Chairman. I want to associate my remarks. We've had a lot of praise for our Chairman and our ranking member. And I certainly think it's appropriate in both cases. 
I represent a district that has an enormous military presence. I have the--with Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, the home of the field artillery and the air Defense artillery, school for precision fires, two of the top six missions that the Army and its modernization effort are based out of there. And then, I've got the largest and most sophisticated air depot in the world, Tinker Air Force Base. So, if I started listing everything in this bill that's important to me, or my constituents, particularly, the 20,000 that work at those two facilities, I'd be here a long time. I want to focus, just I want to thank, again, the chairman and to the ranking member for the manner in which they conduct the committees. 
Now, Ken Calvert and I have been friends for a very long time, good enough friends that, when my very best friend in Congress left a few years ago, John Kline, from the great state of Minnesota, he wouldn't tell me he was leaving, until two minutes before he dropped the press release. So, I immediately called him up because the staff thought I would try and talk him out of leaving, which I certainly would have. And complained about this and said, if you're leaving, Kline, who am I going to, you know, smoke cigars with and drink bourbon with, now? And immediately, the reply came back, ""oh, is Calvert leaving, too?"" So, we've been good friends. And I'm very proud of the work he does on that committee. I think he has a deep knowledge of defense. 
But Mr. Chairman, the chairman sets the tone for every subcommittee we have. And I've watched you in my decade on Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, as you've worked to the top and the manner in which you've built relationships and conducted yourself. And I think I can sum them up in a single-story, when you became the chairman of the full committee. 
I got a call, as I'm sure everybody else on the subcommittee did, that the chairman wanted to meet with me. So, immediately told my scheduler, great, when do I go see him? And she said, oh no, he's coming here. I said, no, call back, right away, he's the chairman of the full committee. He doesn't come here; I go to him. And she did and no, he's coming here. And so, of course, he came in with a terrific staff he's assembled and sat down, and we visited about what my interests were, what concerns were about defense. And then, he told me something I thought was quite profound and really summed up his career. 
He said, Tom, I had the opportunity to be the ranking member on this subcommittee, under two great chairmen, Chairman Freeling Hisen and Chairman Granger. And under both of them, I never felt like I was a member, or the ranking member. I was an equal partner in what we were going to do, as a subcommittee. And that's the way they ran it. And that's the way I intend to run it. This is going to be a committee of partners that focus on defending the United States of America. And you've been true to your word, Mr. Chairman. I cannot recall a partisan vote in the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in your time, as chairman. 
I can recall very few in anybody's time. It says a lot about that subcommittee. But particularly says a lot about you and the manner in which you've run this subcommittee, at a time of great polarization, great partisanship. I don't point any fingers on that. It just is the time in which we live. But you've been a great exception to that rule and I don't think anybody on that committee doubts that you thought about and put first what was good for the men and women in the United States military and what was good for our country. And what was good for this institution and good for this committee. 
So, you will be very much missed. And I just want to tell you, it's been an enormous honor and privilege to serve on that subcommittee, during your time of leadership. And I wish you very well. And I too wish, as I did with my friend John Kline, if something I could say to dissuade you from leaving. But you've left an unmatched legacy of bipartisanship, of thoughtful leadership, you know, and of having the right sense of priorities, both in terms of our military and in terms of this institution and, certainly, this committee. 
Yield back, Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: Before moving to amendments, I have an announcement. Now listen, carefully. 
Ms. Granger, in consultation with Ms. Granger, we will begin at 9:00 a.m., tomorrow, instead of 10:00. We will gavel in at 9:00, so that we can finish in a timely manner. 
(APPLAUSE) 
Mr. Womack, do you have a question about that time? 
WOMACK: No, I just have an announcement. And that is, when recently on a comfort break in one of the stalls in the men's room, I found an iPhone. And if you're missing an iPhone, you male members, you'll find it right on that desk, outside the entry way. 
I was looking around to see if anybody looked lost. I didn't see anybody looking lost. But pretty soon, they're going to be missing an iPhone. But it's out there. And always happy to be at your service. 
I yield back. 
LOWEY: Thank you for that very important announcement. Seeing that no other member wishes to make opening remarks-- 
CLERK: --Mr. Ruppersberger seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Oh, Mr. Ruppersberger, you are recognized. 
RUPPERSBERGER: (OFF-MIC) 
LOWEY: Your mic is not on. 
RUPPERSBERGER: Oh, is it on, now? 
LOWEY: Yes. 
RUPPERSBERGER: As everyone else has said, today, and I want to thank Chairman Visclosky for his leadership and his demeanor and did a great job working with Ranking Member Calvert. And I want to thank all the members of the committee for their dedication in this field. 
As many of you know, after a terrible accident, I was a prosecutor at the time, and my life was saved by a University of Maryland shock trauma, who are consultants to (INAUDIBLE) and the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. My life was saved, after being there for a month. I ended up breaking my back. My whole neck and back are fused. I've got two artificial shoulders, two artificial knees and five screws in each foot. And I've been--the support I received at the trauma, literally, built me into a human being, where I am today. 
What I went through was nothing compared to the trauma our brave men and women experience in war zones, around the world. And they deserve robust support to treat their injuries. I appreciate the committee, once again, funding a peer reviewed orthopedic research program and I also appreciate the record level of funding for the spinal cord injury research program. As a Marylander, I often take for granted, the extraordinary level of success we have Baltimore, DC region, to world-class healthcare providers. 
In the Department of Defense is not uncommon for military families to move to the national Capital region, due to specialized care that a family member needs. Sometimes, these forces service members to make decisions, based on location of healthcare provider and not what is best for their career. We need to expand telehealth services for military families. I appreciate the committee including my request for additional funding to expand telehealth services, specifically, to military children, who experience many stresses that others do not. 
As cochair of the Army Caucus for about the last nine years to my good friend, Judge Carter from Texas, I know that fundamental investments and research and development are critical to ensuring that we continue to produce the best tech for our war fighters to stay ahead of their adversaries. We need strong investment in the Army Research Lab, ARL, headquartered in Maryland, which has opened campuses, throughout the country. I thank the committee for supporting my request for additional funding for artificial intelligence programs and extreme material research for armor and hypersonic applications at ARL. 
I yield back. 
LOWEY: Before we proceed, I would just like to remind all members, keep on your masks. 
Seeing no other member wishing to make-- 
CLERK: Mr. Ryan seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Mr. Ryan, you are recognized. 
RYAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to be brief. One, in support of this bill also just to add my voice to the chorus of support for Chairman Visclosky. 
Being behind him in seniority, a couple seats on the committee, I'm probably not as sad as everyone else is to see him leave. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Wish him a happy retirement. But just, you know, Pete comes from my part of the country. Ms. Kaptur is part of the country. Toledo, Gary, Youngstown, communities that have been super hard hit, over the last 30 or 40 years. 
And there's nobody in Congress, or has been in Congress, for these last two decades, that has fought harder for these communities, whether it was around the steel industry, which is obviously to stop some of the bleeding and the trade deals and all the rest, Pete, but also, utilizing this committee here and public investments that are critical to help communities like ours move into the 21st century, close the skills gap and bring needed economic development. 
And these investments in this committee for every dollar, it could yield anywhere from 3 to 5 other dollars in private sector investments and jobs. And you recognize that, my man. And I appreciate you. I love you. We're going to miss you and wish you a very happy retirement. 
And Ms. Kaptur and I and Ms. McCollum, those of us who represent the industrial Midwest, will continue to fight for you. 
Thank you so much. 
LOWEY: Seeing no other member wishing to make opening remarks, I'd like to recognize Mr. Visclosky to offer a manager's amendment. 
VISCLOSKY: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk and would ask that the reading be waived. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
VISCLOSKY: I would ask that the reading be waived. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading is dispensed with. 
VISCLOSKY: Two quick comments. That is, I want to thank everyone for their kind words. One thing I do look forward to enjoying is not having to look behind me every time I'm walking down a stairwell to see if Tim Ryan is behind me. 
(LAUGHTER) 
I have a manager's amendment, would ask for the members to support of it. And we just highlight the three provisions. 
One deals with the issue of daycare. I was dismayed to learn that the Department of the Army is closing a daycare facility in New Hampshire, giving parents there, little or no time and ability to find a substitute. I think that is shameful to close a facility on such short notice, especially, during a pandemic. 
What I particularly want to point out is the letter that was sent in response to justifying the closure of the center. The Army indicated the reason was a lack of direct funding to continue the CDC operations, also played a key part in the closure decision. 
I would point out that, in fiscal year 2019, the Army was allocated $326 million for daycare. They were so concerned about daycare that, for fiscal year 2020, they asked for less money. We increased that request and have provided $371 million, which is significantly more than the previous year. 
I would then point out, therefore, next year's budget the Army asked for even less money. It is unconscionable. 
I also appreciate that Mr. Womack asked for report language relative to the decision to remove U.S. forces from a multi-force and observers in Egypt. He indicated he believes it's a mistake. I agree and I think all members of the committee agreed with Mr. Womack. And the last highlight would be Ms. Meng has asked for language, given the amount of money the Department spends on advertising, to track how the Department utilizes local media. 
I highlight this because, last year, the committee had the same request and I would read it. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to include with the fiscal year '21 budget submission, the total level of expenditures for fiscal year 2019 and '20, in the requested level of funding for fiscal year '21 for all contracts, or advertising services by women and minority owned businesses, and contracts for advertising services by socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. 
They were to have submitted that with the budget submission the first week in February. This is July 14. We have yet to hear a peep from the Department of Defense. And so, I strongly support the gentlewoman's amendment and would hope that, at this time next year, finally, we will have heard from the Department of Defense and would ask for your support. 
LOWEY: Ranking Member Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. We have no objections to the manager's amendment, work closely with the majority and worked out many of the concerns of our members. So, I appreciate the chairman and support the amendment. 
LOWEY: Are there any other members who wish to be heard on the amendment? 
Mr. Cuellar is recognized. 
CUELLAR: Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to thank you and the ranking member. And I certainly want to thank the chairman. 
One of the things that we do in this Congress is we have the honor of serving with some of the finest men and women. And certainly, in this committee, we have this. And certainly, as the chairman of this appropriations committee, I want to say thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the work and that your ranking member have done. The finest men and women in Congress serving this committee. 
I want to say thank you for adding a couple things, not only to stem pipelines for minorities and Hispanic serving institutions and other institutions that you added here but I want to, in particular, want to thank you for the language addressing the sexual assault crisis that we've seen in the military. 
And particularly, I want to talk about what happened in Fort Hood, when this young lady, Vanessa Guillen, went missing. And the situation that we had there, I was with LULAC, the Poderosas Mujeres this weekend, and military veterans who were, showed support for Ms. Guillen. 
And I just want to say that, when you look at, at this particular situation, and the, really the epidemic that we have in sexual violence and what happens when you at Hispanics that make up about 16 percent of the active duty military, what happened in Fort Hood, and I support the military but I do have a problem. 
And I do ask, where was the Sergeant.? Where was the platoon leader? Where was the commander in this situation? And what does it take to do this type of work and certain LULAC, and other folks took the effort on this. 
So, to add the language that you added, I just want to say thank you because this committee will direct the Comptroller General to conduct a review of the Department's policy for reporting sexual assault and its effectiveness in protecting victims privacy, ensuring their safety and holding offenders accountable. And of course, the comptroller will brief the House and the Senate appropriations. 
So, Mr. Chairman, I just want to say thank you to you and your staff for working with my staff to put this together to address an issue that we need to address. 
So, with that I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
LOWEY: Mr. Womack is recognized. 
WOMACK: I thank the chairwoman. And I, too, want to thank the chairman of the Defense Subcommittee for including language on the multinational force and observers in the manager's amendment. There can be little doubt to anybody, the effectiveness the MFO has played in the regional stability in that part of the world. The Treaty parties of Egypt and Israel and the rest of the world have benefited from what transpired from the Peace Accord of 1979 and the stand-up of the MFO in 1982. 
And I would strongly encourage members of this committee to support the fact that any decision made by the administration to withdraw forces out of the Sinai Peninsula, specifically, U.S. forces, could indeed be counterproductive to the long-term interests of that region. So, again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for hearing that request and for including it in the manager's amendment. I appreciate it and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Are there any other members, who wish to be heard on the amendment? 
The question is on the amendment. All those in favor, say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Those oppose, say no. In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. 
Are there any other amendments? 
For what purpose does the member from California rise. 
UNKNOWN: Madam Chairman, I don't have an amendment, at this moment. I think Mr. Diaz-Balart had the amendment. 
LOWEY: Oh, Ms. Lee. I'm sorry. Ms. Lee is recognized. 
LEE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. It's Lee Amendment Number One. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
CLERK: I ask for unanimous consent to dispense of the reading. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the meeting is dispensed with. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. First, let me thank Chairman Visclosky and our Ranking Member, Mr. Calvert, for your very hard work on this bill. 
Let me just take a moment to say thank you to our chairman. And I, too, want to say to you that I'm going to miss you, tremendously. 
When I think about you and how you will remain in my thoughts, I think of smart. I think of decent, someone with integrity, someone who is honest. And someone who has provided myself much counsel. It's been very wise. And also, I want to just thank you for your support on many of the provisions of this bill. Also, let me just take a moment of personal privilege to say to you, Mr. Chairman, of course, one of my fondest memories was my visit to your district in Gary, Indiana, and you're bringing me a bag of White Castle hamburgers. And I mean a bag, not just one, a bag. 
I will always be indebted to you, Mr. Chairman, for this. I value our friendship and I really look forward to visiting with you again in Gary, Indiana, and get two bags of White Castles, next time. So, thank you very much. You've been a joy to work with, over the years. And your leadership and expertise, it's really going to be missed. 
Madam chair, my amendment is straightforward, as I have introduced it for several years in this committee. And it has received support, over the years, from both sides of the aisle. In fact, three years ago, it passed on a bipartisan basis under Republican majority. And I hope that we can do that again, today. 
My amendment would sunset the overly broad 2001 AUMF, eight months, mind you, eight months after enactment of this act. While it's in place, it gives Congress and the administration plenty of time to vote and debate on a new AUMF. This amendment is not only timely, it is necessary. From pulling out of the Iran deal to moving U.S. carriers to the region, the administration has continued to issue vague threats of military action and has even floated the idea of using the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, as a legal basis to go to war with Iran. 
Congress cannot allow this to happen. And it's a stark reminder, once again, that the danger of leaving the 2001 AUMF on the books, indefinitely, could cause another unfortunate war. On September 14, 2001, yes, I did vote against the 2001 AUMF. It was a 60-word authorization that I knew would provide a blank check to wage war anywhere, anytime, for any length. And in the last 19 years, it has been, increasingly, clear that the AUMF has, essentially, provided the president, any president, the authority to wage war against anyone, any nation, anywhere, at any time. 
Madam Chair, as our brave servicemen and women are deployed around the world, Congress is still missing in action. Our failure to debate and vote on these wars is a betrayal of the American people and our constitutional duty. According to a 2018 congressional research service report, I encourage, actually, my colleagues to read this report. It's become, and this report lays out that it's been cited 41 times in 19 countries to wage war with little, or no congressional oversight. 
In the 2016 report, it cited 37 times in 15 countries. And this report looks only at unclassified incidents. How many other times has it been used, without the knowledge of Congress, or the American people? Not only has this authorization been used to justify military actions, thousands of miles away, it's also been used as a legal justification for warrantless surveillance and wiretaps, indefinite detention practices at Gitmo, targeted killing by drones, including those of American citizens and the open-ended expansion of military operations, again. 
In addition to the activities, I mentioned above, this AUMF has, reportedly invoked, it has been invoked to deploy troops in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Libya and Niger. 
Madam Chair, right now, we know that any president can, unilaterally, wage war, under the outdated 2001 Authorization, without congressional authority. This administration, like previous administrations, continues to be engaged in a proxy war in Yemen, despite the passage of a bipartisan and bicameral war powers resolution to end the U.S. role in that war. As I stated earlier, it's already been publicly floated, the idea of using the 2001 AUMF, as the legal basis to go to war with Iran, a war that Congress has not debated, or authorized. This is truly outrageous and dangerous. And it's not just our wars under 2001 AUMF. The administration has launched unauthorized strikes against Syria twice, without congressional authorization, in violation of the Constitution. 
I know that, while we may not share a common position on what should replace the 2001 AUMF, many of us do agree that the overly broad authority is a major and concerning deterioration of congressional oversight and war making authority. And I think many of us can also agree that a robust debate and vote is necessary, long overdue and must take place. As you remember from three years ago in this committee, we voted in a bipartisan fashion to adopt the same amendment, sunsetting the AUMF, eight months after the bills signed into law, leaving Congress plenty of time to debate and vote on a new one. 
My amendment will not be enacted, immediately. Our troops will not be exposed. We will have eight months to debate and vote on an appropriate authorization for wars this Congress believes important. Mind you, the 2001 AUMF passed within three days. Three days is all it took to write a blank check for war. And only about 20 percent of Congress was serving, when we took that vote, Madam chair, 20 percent. 
This is an abdication of Congress's constitutional responsibility. We need to step up and do our job. So, let me be clear. With the 2001 AUMF still on the books, in its current form, any administration, Democratic or Republican administration, can continue to rely on this blank check to wage endless wars. That's why my amendment to prohibit funding for the 2001 AUMF, after a period of eight months, is so important. In the past--it's far past time to bring almost two decades, two decades of nonstop war to an end. The forever wars have expanded wider and wider, across the globe, have cost us, approximately, $5 trillion, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. 
The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in American history with troops now fighting a war that was launched before they were born. So, enough is enough. 
Please support this amendment. Thank you, again, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
LOWEY: Mr. Visclosky is recognized. 
VISCLOSKY: Appreciate the recognition. I support the gentlewoman's amendment. I think she has stated it very clearly. It is overly broad. The world has changed in the last 19 years and some of those 19 countries, including not only Syria, but Yemen, the Philippines and other parts of Africa. 
I strongly support the gentlewoman's amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I strongly oppose this amendment, which would repeal the legal authority used by our Armed Forces in the fight against Al Qaeda and ISIS. 
As we all know, the 2001 authorization for the use of military force provides authority for the use of military force against Al Qaeda, the terrorists that planned and committed the 9/11 attacks, as well as the Taliban, which provided sanctuary to Al Qaeda. The executive branch has stated that it authorizes all necessary and appropriate force against, not only these two terrorist groups, but also associated forces, such as Islamic State, ISIS, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Al Shabaab in East Africa. 
It is not in the United States interest to repeal this essential counter-terrorism authority, without having an adequate replacement that we'll know--what we'll know will be signed into law. Despite being degraded, both Al Qaeda and ISIS continue to pose a serious threat and remain committed to targeting United States and our interests, around the globe. This amendment presumes 240 days is enough to craft a new AUMF, but we cannot risk it. Repeal and replace would need to be simultaneous. There is vast disagreement on the details and no real-world prospect for a meaningful political consensus of these difficult and weighty constitutional matters. 
To unilaterally repel the principle legal authority on which our military relies to carry out global counter-terrorism operations would be a significant mistake and deeply harmful to our national security. 
I strongly urge defeat of the amendment. 
And I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Watson Coleman is recognized. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. First, I want to thank Congresswoman Lee for her nearly two decades long fight to bring some oversight and accountability to the executive's use of military force. It is extremely frustrating that we are here, yet again, having this debate, when Congress should have, long ago, listened to Congresswoman Lee and asserted our constitutional power to determine when and with whom our nation engages in military conflicts. 
This is not a partisan issue. No matter who wins the presidential election in November, it is critical that the 2001 AUMF be repealed, so that we don't continue surrendering our powers to the executive branch. There are many national security challenges ahead, around the world, and we have seen, repeatedly, that presidents have, too often, relied on military responses to those challenges. The American public has made it clear that they want an end to our forever wars. Adopting this amendment would bring us closer to that goal. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back. 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I, too, strongly oppose this amendment. It would automatically repeal the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, just 240 days, after this bill is signed into law. Our top priority, as elected officials, should be protecting the American people. However, this amendment would undermine our national security, by repealing the authority currently used, to combat the continuing terrorist threat against the United States. 
The 2001 AUMF provides the basis for our military to combat global threats from Al Qaeda, and associated forces such as ISIS, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and Al Shabaab. These groups remain a continuing threat to the United States and to the safety of the American people. 
There are few things more irresponsible than removing a critical legal authority for the U.S. military operations, without having an agreement on what will replace it. As former Secretary of Defense Mattis said, ""the repeal of the AUMF would stall our operations, immediately reduce allied commitments and support and create significant opportunities for our enemies to seize the initiative."" 
This amendment is a poison pill and would eliminate the ability of the men and women of our armed services to keep us safe and I urge--urge a no vote. 
LOWEY: If there is no--Ms. DeLauro is recognized. 
DELAURO: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I rise in strong support of the amendment put forward by our colleague, Barbara Lee. 
As the Congresswoman has stated, the amendment sunsets the overly broad 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, after 240 days of the enactment of this act. In doing so, it empowers, it encourages the Congress to follow its constitutional duty and debate the use of military force. 
President Trump has stretched the AUMF to its limits, conducting worldwide war, without coming to the Congress. Just a few years ago, four American soldiers died in Niger. And when the news broke, it was the first time many members of Congress, or members of the public, realized that America was at war in Northern Africa. 
The justification for that deployment, the 2001 AUMF. According to the 2018 congressional research service report, the 2001 AUMF has become a blank check for war. The United States has deployed troops to Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Libya and like I mentioned, Niger. The executive branch, alone, should not wage war. Unless we visit, revisit the 2001 AUMF, we allow it to continue to do so. 
The Congress cannot stand idly by. In matters of war and peace are some of the most fundamental issues facing our nation and Congress must make its voice heard. It is our constitutional responsibility to debate the use of military force. Closing, I urge my colleagues to support Congresswoman Lee's amendment. We have done so before, repeatedly, and in a bipartisan fashion. Let's do it again. 
Our men and women in uniform protect, preserve our freedom, values and way of life. We owe them so much and we owe them so much more than silence. 
And I yield back. Thank you. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cole is recognized. 
COLE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. And I want to thank my friend for offering her amendment because I think it, actually, is something we ought to be talking about. 
While I oppose this amendment, I think she makes many, many good points. I'm one of the people that do believe the AUMF needs to be replaced. I've actually worked with my colleagues, including my good friend from California, on occasion, to try and do that. 
I will add for the record, I'm actually, strangely, more comfortable with this president not using military force than either of the last two. Because if you actually check the record, he's actually done more to reduce our presence and been more cautious in deploying force than either President Obama, or President Bush. And that ought to be noted for the record. 
He's not the problem, here. The AUMF is the problem. And I am working with Representative Brown and another group, a bipartisan group of legislators to try and craft something that, perhaps, could get us beyond this. But again, my friend makes a good point. But I'm, at the end of the day, persuaded that you have to replace this with something because we do have troops deployed in the area. And it is important that they have legal justification and authorization for being there. And to say we ought to be able to get it done in 240 days is a nice point to make. The problem is, we haven't' been able to get it done in 18 years. So, to believe that we'll, magically, find the solution in 240 days, I think, flies in the face of our own hard experience. 
This is a very difficult thing, but it doesn't change the basic reality that we do need to re-look at this particular document. We do need to reclaim our war making authority. My friend has been a leader in that. And I look forward to working with her, as we find a way to replace what I think is, clearly, a flawed authorization that went further in scope than I think any of its authors ever intended, in terms of giving away congressional war power to the executive branch, regardless of who the president is. But find a way to recapture it in a way that's responsible and does not jeopardize the lives and safety of American troops that are performing really important tasks. 
So, I'm again, working with another group of members on something like this. I think we'll see something. We've editorialized about it, recently. It may or may not be the right way forward. But the debate's an important debate for us to have. And reclamation of war making authority to the Congress of the United States is an important thing for us to achieve. It just shouldn't be accomplished at placing American troops in the field at risk and counting on us being able to come up with an appropriate authorization in 240 days when, again, we haven't been able to do it, so far, in 19 years. 
With that, Madam Chair, again, I applaud my friend, but I don't support the resolution. I yield back my time. 
LOWEY: The Chair has a personal plea. As the markups go along, I know the masks get uncomfortable. But I need all of you to wear them, wear them over your nose and mouth. As Chair, it is my responsibility to keep you and the staff safe. If you remove masks to speak, please put them back on. 
If there is no further debate, the member from California is recognized on the amendment for one minute, to close. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I want to thank all of the members who spoke and those supporting this amendment and those who don't support the amendment. 
But let me just say one thing. First of all, as the daughter of a career military officer, I would never propose any amendment, any legislation, that would put the lives and safety of American troops in jeopardy. 
Secondly, the Authorization to Use Military Force was written and passed in three days--three days. 
Thirdly, Congress has been missing in action for 19 years and 8 months is plenty of time for this body to come up with a new authorization, based upon what we believe constitutes the use of military force. While we may not agree on what a 2001 AUMF replacement should look like, many of us do agree that any replacement should include the scope, size, objective and duration of any military operation. 
In fact, the House adopted language, last summer, outlining what boundaries of time, scope and geography should be attached to any new AUMF. And so, it's time that we sunset and repeal this 2001 AUMF and put Congress back into ensuring that we do our job because we certainly have not. In 19 years, we have been totally missing in action. 
I ask for an aye vote. 
LOWEY: The question is on the amendment offered by the member from California. All those in favor, say aye.

For what purpose does the member from Florida rise? 
DIAZ-BALART: (OFF-MIC) --on the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
DIAZ-BALART: I would ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you. Let me just also add my words of respect and praise to the chairman. 
Mr. Chairman, you mentioned that you are an appropriator. That's your gut. That's your heart. But I would tell you that you are more than that. You're a model appropriator. And you are one who, all of us who have had the privilege of working with you would do well to try to emulate and follow. And you are a gentleman. 
And I thank you for your service to the country and your, again, your loss here is a loss to the country but we're, again, glad that you're going to be moving on to do other things. But thank you for your service. 
Madam Chairwoman, I'm offering this amendment to add several provisions to the bill related to our facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. My amendment would restore four provisions on Guantanamo that have been standard provisions in this bill for many, many years. Bipartisan provisions, which were not included in this mark. 
These provisions would put a limitation on the transfer of remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay to the United States, or a foreign country, or to use the Department of Defense funds to prepare a domestic U.S. facility for the detention, or imprisonment, of Guantanamo detainees. 
Or again, to--or carry out the closure or realignment of the facility in Guantanamo Bay. 
So, even though the last president pledged to close the detention center, Congress, Congress in a bipartisan way, resisted those plans. Today, only 40 terrorists remain in Gitmo. But they're the worst of the worst, my friends. And that's why this president has signed an executive order reversing the previous president's executive order issued in 2009, to try to close down that military prison. 
Now, the executive order notes that a number of the remaining individuals at the facility are being prosecuted in military commission, while others must be detained to protect against continuing significant threats to the security of the United States. 
In addition, because some of the current detainee population represents the most difficult and dangerous cases, from among those historically there, there's a significant reason for concern, regarding their re-engagement in hostilities, should they again, have the opportunity. 
In fact, my understanding and I don't think anybody will doubt, that will correct me on this, is that, of those previously released, over 200 individuals resumed their hostility, their terrorist career. 
So again, this is an amendment to bring back bipartisan language that has been in the bill to protect the American people from this group of individuals, the dangerous group of individuals that are there. 
And I would ask for your favorable consideration. And with that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Chair Visclosky is recognized. 
VISCLOSKY: I appreciate the gentleman's kind words and, therefore, can't believe he would offer an amendment to the bill. 
(LAUGHTER) 
But reluctantly, would express my opposition. I would simply note that, as he rightly points out, the bill is silent on the issues that are very important to him. 
I would also point out that the Trump Administration was silent on this issue because they did not request that the committee include these provisions. And except for the request and amendment offered by the gentleman, today, in markup of this legislation, we received no written request from any member of the House to include this language in the bill. 
I would also point out that the Trump Administration has not requested a move of the detainees, or suggested they are going to shut down the prison. The committee has no indication that the administration wants to or plans to do anything about these amendments to seek to stop. 
The committee does fund the prison. And we do have asked for report language, is seeking to bring down the extraordinary cost in future years. 
Each participant at Guantanamo, each of those 48 individuals, are costing the American taxpayers about $10 million, per year. 
So, the gentleman is correct. It is a security issue that weighs on him but there is a monetary issue here, as well. So, I would ask opposition to the gentleman's amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT.: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I strongly support the amendment. Chairman Visclosky, Chairwoman McCollum, Ranking Member Carter and I traveled to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, earlier this year. We saw, firsthand, some of the challenges there and heard from Admiral Faller and his staff how SOUTHCOM is reviewing our base size and the number of personnel serving there. 
The detention facility there opened in 2002 to hold detainees affiliated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But now, it only holds 40 remaining hard-core terrorists charged in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and the October 2000, strike on the Destroyer USS Cole. 
I realize that the administration did not request these general provisions included in the bill. It did so, not because it opposes the language but because all Departments of Defense under every administration resists congressional limitations that reflexively seek maximum flexibility. 
In fact, President Trump issued an executive order in 2018 reversing the prior administration's efforts to end U.S. detention operations and close the Guantanamo Bay facility. 
As reflected in a long-standing provision, my friend from Florida seeks to put back in the bill, the executive order recognizes the inherent dangers associated with potentially putting enemy combatants back on the battlefield to threaten our forces, by transferring them abroad. 
As executive order states, ""Given that some of the current detainee population represent the most difficult and dangerous cases from among those, historically, detained at the facility, there is significant reason for concern, regarding their re-engagement in hostilities, should they have the opportunity."" 
I don't think many of our friends on the other side actually want the executive branch to transfer any of the remaining terrorists, the worst of the worst, to a foreign country, where they could, potentially, escape and again, threaten our homeland security. 
Likewise, I doubt many of our constituents would support the transfer of detainees like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to a prison or other facility, here in the United States. 
In that context, I would, respectfully, suggest it doesn't make sense for this commander, or this committee to give a blank check to the executive branch regarding a transfer of those remaining hard-core Guantanamo terrorists, or close the facility there. 
That's why these limitations have reflected consensus congressional policy for nearly a decade and why I strongly support the gentleman's amendment. 
With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you, Madam Chair. While I have the utmost respect for my friend and colleague, Mr. Diaz-Balart, I do oppose his amendment. 
As has been said, and it bears repeating, the president not only excluded this language from his proposed budget for the last two fiscal years, he actually, affirmatively, dropped it, two fiscal years ago. And we should continue that practice, as the bill does. 
Given what we know about the cost and efficacy of maintaining the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, we should be committed to seeing that it be closed. The military prison at Guantanamo Bay was set up nearly 20 years ago and was, initially, envisioned to be a temporary holding facility. 
Its continued existence today serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists, emboldened for oppressive governments and endangers our troops serving on foreign soil. 
Its very existence poses a significant challenge to the human rights and due process protections that gives the U.S.'s soft power an influence, abroad. 
The cost of this facility is not merely to America's reputation in the world and to our national security. According to the New York Times, the expense to detain the 40 prisoners held there amounts to $13 million, per prisoner, per year. 
Our justice system serves us well and has resulted in deserved convictions for accused terrorists. Our system of justice works, effectively. It is somewhat ludicrous to hear a suggestion that, if they were transferred here to the mainland and tried here in the United States, that we would risk their escape. 
It should be utilized to prosecute these heinous murderers to the fullest extent of the law. And we should show, as we repeatedly have, that that works. 
I urge a no vote on this amendment. We should be looking to close the world's most expensive detention program and make the United States a safer and more just nation, at the same time. 
I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly support the amendment. The remaining 40 detainees, held at Guantanamo Bay, are, to quote Mr. Diaz-Balart, ""the worst of the worst."" 
They are more dangerous than most people can comprehend. They're pure evil cannot be rehabilitated and can never be released. 
There's every reason to believe these detainees would reengage in planning and executing attacks, against the United States and our allies, if they had the opportunity. 
I find it difficult to believe that any of us support the transfer of dangerous Gitmo detainees, such as the self-confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks to a facility here in the United States. The provisions that this amendment would add to the bill are not new. Two of them were in the House, first in the bill last year. All four were in the bill that was signed into law by the president. 
These provisions are too important to our national security to just allow them to fall away. I strongly support the gentleman's amendment and urge its adoption. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, the amendment from Florida-- 
CLERK: Dr. Harris seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Dr. Harris is recognized. 
HARRIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Very briefly, I find it interesting that the argument against it is that this administration hasn't requested it, or doesn't intend to pursue this policy, forgetting that there's actually an election coming up and that this bill and, therefore, these amendments would actually be enforced, for the entire fiscal year, two thirds of which could be a different administration. 
This is a policy decision by Congress to say, should we allow Guantanamo Bay to close, or not and to use an argument that could vanish in four months, again, negates the fact that there could be an administration coming in and on its first day say, we're closing Guantanamo Bay. And Congress has the opportunity, right now, to take a position on that. 
So, I think the gentleman from Florida is absolutely correct. Congress should continue the position at stake and, regardless of this administration's stance because the majority of Americans, I don't think, want Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in their back yard. 
I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, the member from Florida is recognized on the amendment for one minute, to close. 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. Let me just quote from the Director of National Intelligence. They assess that some of the detainees currently at Gitmo will seek to reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities, after they are transferred. 
Transfers to countries with ongoing conflict and internal stability, as well as recruitment by insurgent and terrorist organizations, could pose an increased interest, increased risk of engagement, again, as we've seen in the past. 
So, as you heard now, there is no reason, there's no compelling reason to not put this language in there that has been there for a long time in a bipartisan way, when there's no other plan. 
This is to keep the American people safe. This is language that has been there before. We should put it there one more time. And I would ask for your favorable consideration. 
I would yield back. 
LOWEY: The question is on the amendment offered by the member from Florida. All those in favor say aye.

LOWEY: On this vote, the ayes are 24, the nays are 28. The amendment is not adopted. 
For what purpose does the member from California rise? 
LEE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk; Lee Amendment Number Two. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
LEE: I ask for unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. The member from California is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. This amendment, once again, is very simple. It would just terminate the outdated but still dangerous 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. 
I say outdated because the 2002 AUMF no longer serves any operational purpose. U.S. military deployments and operations carried out, under the 2002 AUMF dubbed operation Iraqi Freedom, that officially concluded in 2011. 
And I say dangerous because the 2002 contained no sunset provision. Leaving this outdated and unnecessary authorization on the books allows presidents to use it for military action Congress never intended to authorize, something we've already seen from prior administrations and this administration. 
We need to send a clear message that the president must seek specific authorization from Congress for any use of force against Iran, or any other country. The claim we heard, earlier this year from the president, that the 2002 AUMF can authorize attacks against Iran has no basis in reality, underscoring the need for us to take action to repeal this language. 
The House has already voted twice to repeal this AUMF. We can't afford to leave outdated AUMF's in place, indefinitely. It's past time for Congress to finally do our constitutional duty and exercise our congressional responsibility and vote on matters of war and peace. 
I ask for an aye vote. 
LOWEY: Mr. Visclosky. 
VISCLOSKY: I support the gentlewoman's amendment. As she pointed out in her remarks, in October of 2011, President Obama confirmed that all U.S. combat troops would withdraw from Iraq, after negotiations. 
Nevertheless, nine years later, the authorization, despite the cessation of hostilities, continues to be used. It is time for its repeal. And I do support the gentlewoman's amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I strongly oppose this amendment to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. Madam Chair, although the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime was the initial focus of this act, the United States has relied on the 2002 AUMF to authorize the use of force to help support a stable, democratic Iraq and to address the threat posed by armed militia groups and terrorists in Iraq after the fall of Saddam. 
Although the physical caliphate of ISIS has been destroyed in Iraq, the organization remains a threat, and the U.S. forces remain in-country to support the enduring defeat of ISIS. In addition, Iran has remained a malign presence in the region and during the Iraq war, used pro-Iranian militias to attack and kill hundreds of U.S. service members. 
According to our CENTCOM commander, General Mackenzie, since May of 2019, these Iranian support groups in Iraq have attacked U.S. military and diplomatic targets dozens of times, including a siege of our embassy in Baghdad and conducted scores of unmanned aerial system reconnaissance flights near the U.S. and Iraqi security forces. A 2002 AUMF enables us to protect our servicemen and women in Iraq, not only through self-defense but through pursuit of terrorists and should not be repealed without being simultaneously replaced by an updated authority. 
As the Pentagon's general counsel reminds us, the use of force under the 2002 AUMF was not solely addressed at Saddam Hussein, but threats to the United States posed by militias, terrorist groups and other armed groups in Iraq. Indeed, the Obama administration invoked both the 2002 and 2001 AUMF as a domestic legal authority for conducting military operations against ISIS in Iraq and also operations in Syria to address threats emanating from Iraq. 
Repealing the 2002 AUMF with no replacement would only embolden Iran and support its ambitions in Iraq and undercut the efforts by our military and the president to safeguard our national security. While there may be well a case for a serious effort to update the 2002 AUMF, this amendment appears to be more about partisan point-scoring than in clarifying the sources of domestic legal authority to engage in armed conflict. 
I, therefore, oppose this amendment, and I urge its defeat. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Quigley is recognized. 
QUIGLEY: I think the simplest response to those who respectfully say that we don't have anything to replace these is we never do anything here unless we are absolutely, positively forced to do it. So in, what, 18-19 years, we haven't done it with most of these. I think that this amendment makes sense because hopefully, it will absolutely force us to finally face this issue and do something that we should've done a long time ago. Thank you. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Madam Chair, I strongly oppose the amendment. This amendment would repeal the 2002 Authorization of the Use of Military Force in Iraq, which has helped protect our military service members from continuing threats from Iran and other terrorists. Iran has routinely used its militias in Iraq to attack U.S. forces, killing hundreds of our service members during the Iraq war and targeting our troops repeatedly in recent meant--months. 
We should not repeal this authority unless and until we have agreed on a new AUMF that will allow us to combat these enemies effectively. Repealing the 2002 AUMF now will send the wrong signal to Iran and its proxy forces in Iraq. It will also undercut the efforts of the administration to keep America safe. 
While it may be time for a serious bipartisan discussion about modernizing AUMF, it is not likely to occur this year. As a result, I strongly oppose the amendment and urge its defeat. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate. The member from California is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. First of all, this is not about scoring any partisan points. The war in Iraq officially ended in 2011. The war in Iran was based on the notion that it was--that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which, of course, we knew were not there, but this Congress authorized it anyway. 
And so when you talk about a replacement for the Iraq resolution for a war against Iraq, a replacement should be debated. And it should be updated based on the wars that this Congress believes are authorized or should be authorized. And so we need to assert our Article I responsibility to define when and how our country goes to war. 
We've been to war with Iraq. That's what the 2002 Authorization authorized. For the life of me, it doesn't make any sense to continue to keep this authorization on the books. 
It is over. It concluded in 2011, and it was called Operation Iraqi Freedom. I asked for an aye vote. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: I want to remind members before I continue that we will break for food at one. 
The question is on the amendment offered by the member from California, all those in favor say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Those opposed say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
LOWEY: In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the amendment is adopted. 
For what purpose does the member from Maryland rise? 
HARRIS: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, Harris amendment number one, and I-- 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
HARRIS: I move to waive the reading. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. 
The member from Maryland is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
HARRIS: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. This amendment, part of it is similar to one I offered last year. But the--but the situation has changed greatly since last year and needs to be expressed again. 
You know, the problem is, is that a lot of drugs move across our southern border. And an article in the Los Angeles Times, September 1st, 2019, so subsequent to the last time we discussed this, is entitled Death, Made in Mexico: Traffickers Embrace Fentanyl. And if you look at some of the statistics mentioned in the article, again, this Los Angeles Times, it says last year, so that would be 2018, of course, it's gotten worse since then, more than 31000 people in the United States died after taking fentanyl or one of its close--chemical relatives, according to the CDC. No other drug in modern history has killed more people in a year. We're talking about fentanyl. The article goes on to say. Fentanyl started appearing on U.S. streets in significant quantities in 2013. Most of it produced in China and shipped in the mail. 
But then, says today, officials say the--and--the men--this is a year--this almost a year ago. Today, officials say the majority is smuggled from Mexico, where it is remaking the drug trade as traffickers embrace it over heroin, which is more difficult and expensive to produce. And if you're talking about profitability, it--the article goes on to say it--it costs $32,000 to produce one kilogram of fentanyl, and that two-point--two pounds can be used to manufacture one million pills with a street value of $20 million. This drug trade has to be stopped. Simply, it's killing tens of thousands of Americans, and most of it comes from Mexico. So let's move to the amendment. 
The amendment does two things. It strikes section 8134 and 8136. Now, I'll remind the Committee, as a--when I spoke on the gentleman from Florida's amendment, that we are actually discussing a fiscal year constraint, not just President Trump. It could be a different president after January. And we--and--and my question, why we would want to tie the--the next administration's hands, whoever it is, with sections 8134 and 8136? Because 8134 does not just prohibit a wall. It prohibits any funds on the border security infrastructure. 
Well, border security infrastructure, because the DOJ is heavily--it is involved in drug interdiction, and that's by statute. Border security infrastructure could include things like roads or lights or things at the port of entry because this says anywhere along the southern border. The gentleman from Texas made the point yesterday, well, fentanyl crossed the ports of entry. While this--Section 8134 says, the DOD can't do anything at a port of entry. Not only this administration but a potential future administration, because eight months of this bill will pertain to the next administration. 
Let's go on to Section 8136, 8136, says you can't use the National Guard on the border. It doesn't say for immigration purposes. It just says you can't use them. Well, that means you can't use them for drug interdiction at the border. Why in the world when we are in the midst of a horrendous fentanyl epidemic, why would we want to tie anyone's hands-on drug interdiction? 
And I get it. Some people don't like this president. I fully get it. But this bill is not just--may not just pertain to this president. It might pertain to a different president. And that president coming into office could say, you know what, I do care about the fentanyl, What--what is happening with fentanyl and maybe by then the passage across the border of fentanyl has gotten even worse. And the president says you know what? I'm going to throw everything at it. I'm going to do border infrastructure. I don't believe in walls. 
But I do believe in lights and roads. I do believe that we should--we should--that the national interest is--is--is benefited by putting National Guard on that border to stop every single milligram of fentanyl from crossing that border because it's so profitable and so deadly. But Sections 8134 and 8136 tie the president's hands from doing that within well-established statutory authority to fight a war on drugs by whatever means that president feels it's important through the Department of Defense budget. 
So I would urge the--the Committee to seriously consider removing Section 80--8134 and 8136. They are too broadly written. They go far beyond the wall. And they could impede our ability to stop the war on fentanyl. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Visclosky. 
VISCLOSKY: I appreciate the gentleman's sentiment and could not disagree that we have a drug problem in the United States of America. However, I am opposed to his amendment for several reasons. One, if Congress voted to use defense money to build a wall anyplace, that would not be an unconstitutional act. Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution says that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law. The fact is, after those laws were signed by the president of the United States twice, this administration, I believe, illegally transferred those funds that were not enumerated by the Congress for a wall for the wall. 
Recently, there was a federal appeals court that ruled last month that the administration did not have that authority. So I would point out to my colleagues, there's nothing in this bill will that prohibits the administration from building a wall anyplace. What we're saying is you can't use dedicated defense dollars to do so. 
The gentleman also indicates that the Guard cannot be deployed to the border. What we say in the bill is you have to reimburse the Guard if they are deployed. And that is a long-standing tradition. If the Guard is deployed in national emergencies under FEMA, for example, they are reimbursed. Under COVID, they are reimbursed. 
They should be reimbursed if they are deployed to the border. That's all we're saying. We have dedicated defense dollars. They should not be used for unintended purposes. And I would oppose the gentleman's amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairman, I strongly support the gentleman's amendment, which would strike Sections 8134 and 8136 of the bills. I have the greatest respect for the chairman. He's been a great leader in crafting this bill. However, I respectfully disagree with him on Sections 8134 and 8136, which prohibit the use of funds to construct a wall, fence, border barriers or border security infrastructure along the southern border and limits the department's ability to provide assistance to other agencies in drug smuggling corridors along the border. 
I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cuellar is recognized. 
CUELLAR: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I speak against his amendment. With all due respect to my friend from Maryland, let me give you some of the reasons why. 
Again, I live on the border. I don't just go down there and visit a few hours, so I'm familiar with the--the situation down there and--and what we're seeing down there. Again, I do want to emphasize that, last week, the president of Mexico was in--at the White House, and we know what the president had promised. We're going to build this wall, and we're going to have Mexico pay for this wall. And I did not hear (UNTRANSLATED), which is Spanish for where's the check, from the Mexican president? 
So I--I'm do want to say that I believe in private property rights and I want to make sure that we understand the facts here. First of all, we've had--a wall that even the wind has knocked down. If you recall, I think it was in central California, Madam Chair, CBP Agent Carlos Petronius (SP) had said that the wall had not been set correctly on this. So there are issues with the wall itself, the fence. 
But let me give you the facts on two things. Let me first talk about how people come across, and then I'll talk about the drugs itself. If you look at how people come across, I would say for the last ten years, the primary mode of entry of the undocumented population to the United States have been visa overstays, that is the visa overstays. If you look at this, you will see that DHS, and I'm quoting a newspaper, but DHS numbers from 2016 to 2017, the people who overstayed their visas accounted for 62 percent of the newly undocumented immigrants. So they're not totally coming across the river. They're coming in through visa overstays. And the number one violator is not Mexico or Central America, but it is Canada. I emphasize our friends to the north--north, Canada itself. 
Now, let's talk about drugs, and I certainly want to see more border patrol. I want to see technology. I want to make sure that we stop the drugs from coming in. But again, not quoting a newspaper, but quoting the official numbers from CBP, looking at what comes in, in between ports of entry, what comes through the ports of entry. 
If you look at the drugs that have come in, you will see that in FY '19, 89 percent of the cocaine that came into the United States came through ports of entry, not in between ports. If you look at the cocaine--that was cocaine. If you look at the heroin, 84 percent of the heroin that came in came through ports of entry and not in between ports. 
If you look at what you've been emphasizing, my good friend from Maryland, and here are the facts. 92 percent of the fentanyl came through ports of entry. I emphasize 92 percent of the fentanyl that you keep talking about has--have come in through ports of entry. And again, we want to stop all the drugs from coming in, whether they're from Mexico, China, or India. When you talk about fentanyl, but 92 percent of the drugs, of the fentanyl, have come in. When you look at meth, 81 percent of the meth coming into the United States have come through ports of entry. 
So, yes, I want to make sure that we have law and order at the border. But I would say that even you are looking at the FBI statistics, I can pick almost any city in Maryland, and I would tell you that the border cities are safer than almost any city in Maryland. And I can venture that very safely. So, again, I want to make sure that we have law and order at the border. I want to make sure that we stop the drugs. But if we're going to put resources, and we'll have a chance tomorrow on Homeland, that we put it where it belongs. 92 percent of the fentanyl that comes into the United States come through ports of entry, not in between. 
So, again, with all due respect to my friend from Maryland, those are the facts. I don't want to confuse anybody with the facts, but we need to make sure that we do this correctly. I want to make sure that we stop drugs from coming in, but let's do it in the right way. And for those reasons, I oppose, with all due respect, my friend from Maryland's amendment. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly support this amendment. The appropriations bills we are considering must be enacted into law. And writers like this just make it more difficult for Congress to get our work done. 
As I've said before, I've been to the border countless times, and I've seen firsthand important impact the wall is having. If members are focused on securing our border and not on political messaging, I think we all could agree on what has been accomplished. 
As of last week, 229 miles of new border wall systems have been completed. Customs and Border Protection officials have confirmed that the wall stops most of the border crossings in areas where it's built. It is also dramatically slowing down those who attempt to get around it, allowing agents more time to respond. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized. 
HERRERA BEUTLER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I--I just couldn't support--I guess everybody here probably has a lock on their door, if not a fence in their yard and--and we lock it at night to protect to choose who comes and goes. So I don't understand any objection whatsoever to the construction of a wall or a fence or--or--or basically boundary barriers. So I--I definitely support the gentleman's amendment. And with that, I'd like to yield the rest of my time to Dr. Harris. 
LOWEY: Dr. Harris is recognized. 
HARRIS: And I think--thank the gentlelady for yielding me a minute or two, because I don't think a minute is going to be enough to address what the gentleman from Texas said. The gentleman from Texas missed my entire point. 
UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) No he didn't. 
HARRIS: My entire point is not about a wall. It's that the clear reading of the language of Section 8134 and 8136, for instance, affect ports of entry. It's clear reading. It says border security infrastructure along the southern land border of the United States, those ports of entry, are, correct me if I'm wrong, there on the southern land border. And Section 8136 says no funds made available may be used by members of the Armed Forces on active duty in support of security or immigration at the southern border. That includes ports of entry. 
My argument that--that those who are fixated on stopping this administration from building a wall should have left it at that. But it didn't. This language is far broader than that. It affects any ability under 10--remember tenuously and the--the--the chairman of the subcommittee didn't mention that, you know, 10 USC 284 clearly sets up the DOD as one of the drug enforcement agents in the United States. Clearly, under congressional authority, the DOJ can spend money to stop the--to stop drugs. The problem is that Section 8134 and 816--36 here go after that authority as well. Not only building a wall but the authority to spend monies, for instance, for National Guard under 10 USC 284. It's a bridge too far. 
I understand 92 percent of drugs come in at ports of entry. Then why would you want to tie the hands of the Department of Defense to help in the--in the war on drugs at the ports of entry? Why? I agree we have--we have to do everything. This is a horrendous war. Fentanyl is it. We can mention methamphetamine and whatever. But in fact, Mexico is the leading source of fentanyl. Fentanyl killed 31,000 people two years ago. I suspect it probably killed 35,000, maybe because of COVID 40,000 this year. Most of it comes across that border. 
I understand the zeal in stopping this president from building a wall. But why would you tie the president's hands-on other means of drug interdiction using DOD funds? And more importantly, the next president potentially because this bill does extend for the entire fiscal year. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mrs. Wasserman Schultz is recognized. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you, Madam Chair. I rise in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would strike two provisions, Section 8134 and 8136 as--as discussed that I believe are important for holding this administration accountable, protecting our troops, and ensuring that our military is used in the most responsible and effective way. 
Section 8134 would establish a prohibition on the use of funds within this bill for the reconstruction of any unnecessary and ridiculous border wall as this president is trying to do. The president has siphoned billions of dollars from our military to attempt to build the border wall, and these funds were--were appropriated by us for uses that were requested by the military services. 
Enough is enough. As an appropriator, I'm tired of this president moving duly appropriated funds around as he sees fit, completely ignoring the will of the coequal Article 1 branch of government. We cannot continue to let the executive branch usurp our constitutionally protected authority over spending federal taxpayer dollars. It's time to reassert our authority and take it back from--a rampant executive that has run amuck. If not, we will all look back and regret the precedents that have been set by this administration. 
The second section, this amendment would strike a Section 8136, which would prohibit the Armed Forces from serving on active duty in support of border security or immigration enforcement unless the secretary of defense enters an agreement with the requesting agency to reimburse costs incurred by DOD. I don't believe that we should be military--militarizing our border. Further, I believe that our troops, time, effort, and resources could be better spent elsewhere because they are needed for true military purposes, which guarding a border with Mexico is not. 
We have a Customs and Border Patrol that is responsible by definition for that purpose, and we get into dangerous territory when we allow the administration to use our military either for law enforcement purposes or in pursuit of a politically motivated stunt that is only meant to excite the president's xenophobic base. There is no emergency on the southern border, and there is no need for troops. At the very least, DOD should be reimbursed for the help it provides the Department of Homeland Security, which does not occur now. 
These two provisions should not be stricken from the bill, and I encourage the Committee to vote against this wrongheaded amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. 
LOWEY: If there is no debate. The member from Maryland is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
HARRIS: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I'll be very, very brief. 
There is an emergency on our southern border. Fentanyl is flowing across it and killing tens of thousands of Americans every single year. If that's not an emergency, I don't know what is. And I don't understand why Section 8134 and 8136 were not drafted much more narrowly to prevent only wall funding, not to prevent spending on drug interdiction at the southern border, either through border, security infrastructure in Section 8134 or with the use of National Guard, if necessary, for drug interdiction under Section 8136. I yield back. 
LOWEY: The question is on the amendment offered by the member from Maryland. All of those in favor say aye.

LOWEY: On this vote, the ayes are 21, the nays are 31. The amendment is not adopted. 
For what purpose does the member from Illinois arise? 
QUIGLEY: Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask that the reading be dispensed of. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the--oh. 
Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. 
QUIGLEY: And I will offer and withdraw this amendment with the commitment to the attempt to increase this funding in conference. And I do want to thank Chairman Visclosky and both the majority and minority committee staff for working diligently with me and my staff toward that end and providing the commitment to continue working on this as we move forward through the process. 
And Chairman Visclosky, I would say those who have said wonderful things about you today, based on your being from Indiana, once a Hoosier, always a Hoosier. I--I was born there as well. And thank you for your service. 
Yesterday, Representative Fortenberry talked about ALS. He has been a bipartisan partner on ALS efforts this past Congress and continues his efforts. And many of my fellow appropriators are members of the ALS Caucus. Ranking Member Calvert is the co-chair, Representative Aguilar, Carter, Cole, Cuellar, Kilmer, McCollum, and Ruppersberger--Ruppersberger. 
The bill before us today includes funding for many important congressionally directed medical research programs, including ALS Research. I support all this important research. However, the ALS line has been historically underfunded for decades, despite ALS disproportionately impacting our military and our veteran communities. 
Last year, we worked with the chair, and under his leadership, we were able to double the research funding from 10 million to 20 million, and I and we are very grateful for that historic increase. But consider in context 20 million for the DOD to study and help cure ALS. It's simply not enough. While I was eager to again double this budget, adding an additional 20 million in an effort for more parity across disease research communities, the amendment here would increase the funding for ALS by 5 million. 
The curtain--the current ALS program at DOD has laid out a strategic plan that is working exceptionally well and has worthy research that can support funding for up to 40 million. Also, the program is bridging basic research and clinical trials that support the warfighter, and the additional funding would help--would help them move toward the trials they need. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman Lowey, Chairman Visclosky, and Ranking Member Calvert for their willingness to work with me going forward to secure additional funding. Ms. Chairwomen, at this time, I would like to withdraw my amendment. 
LOWEY: Thank the gentleman for withdrawing the amendment. If there is no further debate, the amendment is withdrawn. 
UNKNOWN: Return? 
LOWEY: My friends, we are recessing for lunch. Please be back at two o'clock. Thank you. 
UNKNOWN: Two o'clock, wow. 
(RECESS) 
LOWEY: For what purpose does the member from California rise? Member from California. 
LEE: Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes. I have an amendment at the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
LEE: It's Lee amendment Number 3, and I ask unanimous consent to dispense of the reading. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. 
LEE: Thank you again, Madam Chair. And again, this amendment is straightforward. It would block the president from starting a war with Iran absent express authorization from Congress. This amendment actually consists of language that the House has already adopted as part of HR-550 in January of this year. 
Now let me be clear, this amendment would not prohibit the president from using the authority he currently has under article two of the constitution to respond to any attack on the United States or our allies--allies. He has that authority. It simply makes it clear that the president of the United States cannot go to war with Iran without express authorization from Congress. 
Madam Chair, we know that the Trump administration has taken Very clear steps to escalate tensions with Iran in an attempt to build up an unconstitutional and unauthorized war. First, this administration pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the JCPOA, despite the fact that the remainder of our European partners stay--stated that they would remain committed to it and that Iran was compliant with the deal. 
Then this administration floated using the 2001 AUMF as a legal basis for engaging in military action in Iran. Former state Department legal--legal advisor Harold Cole (SP) labeled this as ridiculous. So, this playbook is very, very clear and we've been down this same road on Iraq, and we cannot afford to make the same mistake again. 
I know we do not all agree on how to manage the United States relationship with Iran and we have a lot of work to do to ensure that the United States pursues comp--comprehensive diplomatic solutions to address the issues we have there, but we should all agree that we should not send the signal that the president or any president must come to Congress to ensure that full--that the full Congress receives all the information that they need to make and inform an informed decision and that the president comes to Congress to see--seek express authorization in accordance with the constitution. So, Madam Chair, I ask for an aye vote and I hope we can get a bipartisan vote on this one. Thank you again. 
LOWEY: Mr. Visclosky is recognized. 
VISCLOSKY: Thank you very much. I support the gentlewoman's amendment. The amendment, as she pointed out, would prohibit funds for military force against Iran unless Congress has declared war or authorized such force in line with the war powers resolution. 
I would want to be clear. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and threatens our interests in the region and Israel. Having said that, any decision to commit our forces against Iran should not be taken lightly and must involve Congress. And I would ask for your support of the Lee amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I strongly oppose this amendment. This amendment appears to be based on the so-called no war against Iran act, which the house already voted on several times in recent months, which has no chance of becoming law. 
This language would block funding for any use of military force in or against Iran unless Congress has declared war, enacted a new AUMF, or a national emergency is created by an attack upon the United States. I cannot imagine a more counterproductive restriction on this--on this or any other president. Just to remind my colleagues, there is no country that is more hostile to the interest of the United States and our allies, especially Israel, then Iran. 
There should be zero ambiguity about the right of the United States to defend itself and its allies from Iranian hostile acts. These hostile acts include dozens of attacks against Americans in Iraq. Attacking the U.S. embassy, attacking or seizing commercial shipping in the Gulf, providing legal aid to destabilizing groups throughout the region, including those aiming to attack Israel and ultimately launching more than a dozen ballistic missiles in a deliberate attack against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. 
Perhaps not all my colleagues on the other side would agree, but our response to this Iranian provocation, the strike on General Soleimani, was appropriate and helped strengthen deterrence. Unfortunately, this provision directly undermines that enhanced deterrence by calling into question the ability and the will of the United States to defend our partners and our national interests. This amendment impermissibly and unwisely tries to tie the president's hands in Iran, emboldens our adversary, and creates dangerous doubt about the American power and purpose in the Middle East. I oppose this amendment and I urge its defeat. 
LOWEY: Mr. Price is recognized. 
PRICE: Thank you, Madam chairman. I rise in strong support of this amendment. We have every reason to take cautionary measures to prevent war with Iran. We have every reason to ensure that President Trump comes to Congress before taking offensive military action. 
President Trump recklessly offended and an intricate diplomatic achievement to prevent nuclear Iran, the JCPOA. He had nothing to replace it. Indeed, he had no diplomatic path to the much vaunted better deal. The administration then launched an ill-defined maximum pressure campaign and assassinated the head of the Quds force, General Soleimani, which took us to the brink of war. It could happen again. The House already voted to require congressional approval for additional military action in Iran, and we should reaffirm that position through this amendment today. 
Contrary to what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued, this is not about whether Iran is a good or bad actor. We know the answer to that. It's a matter of asserting the constitutional power of the Article 1 branch of government, yes it's about that, and it is also a matter of reining in the extremely provocative and dangerous policies of this administration toward Iran. I urge a yes it vote. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this dangerous and highly partisan amendment. This measure would tie the hands of the president, undermining our national security, and putting U.S. service members at risk. Iran had a long and bloody history of attacking U.S. and coalition forces both directly and indirectly. The Iranian regime remains the greatest threat to regional stability and security in the Middle East. 
Iran continues to destabilize Iraq. They are jeopardizing our partnership with Baghdad by using malicious and violence to achieve their political agenda. Yet, this amendment would prevent the president from responding to new attacks on the U.S. and coalition partners, our diplomats, and on commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. I am deeply concerned this amendment would make conflict more, not less likely for the United States and our partners in the Middle East, including our great ally, Israel. 
For all these reasons, a president rightly threatened to veto a measure with similar language when it was debated by the House earlier this year. I oppose the amendment and for the safety and security of this country and our allies, I urge its defeat. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cole 
COLE: Thank you very much, Madam chairman. I strongly oppose this amendment and I think we ought to take a minute and review the facts. We are told that somehow the president did something wrong in pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal. It was a terrible deal. It was a deal that was so bad, it was not put before Congress. And there are people on both sides of this room--on both sides of the aisle that oppose that deal. The majority of the House opposed it, at the majority of the Senate oppose it. Any of you think it was a brilliant deal, just beg to differ with you on that. 
We're told the Iranians were keeping the deal. No kidding. If you get a deal that good, you're going to keep the deal. It allowed them to continue to work toward acquiring nuclear weapons. They got $150 billion out of the deal. You know, it basically, you know improved their position. It was a bad deal for the United States. 
To be fair to the president, he said he was going to pull us out of that deal when he was running for office. This was not exactly a mystery. For those of you that seem to think that President Trump, you know, is likely to lead us to war with Iran, I would just invite you to look at the facts. Look at what has happened on his watch and what the Iranians have done and how he's responded. 
We all remember the fact that we had a drone shot down in international airspace by the Iranians and Mr. Trump's own Pentagon urged him to strike Iran. He thought about it, it didn't do it. We had Saudi Arabia attack an ally of the United States by the Iranians. That would have been an excuse to attack. Is that what the president did? No. 
He sent missile defense forces to help the Saudis defend themselves. We had it ships in the Gulf attacked by the Iranians. That would have been a good excuse to attack. Did he do it? No. He put together an international naval task force to defend those troops. We had U.S. soldiers attacked by Iranian proxies in Iraq. Did the president respond with an attack? No. He attacked the Iranian proxies in Iraq. 
Only when we finally had a threat against the American embassy did he act. Did he act by attacking Iran? No, he did not. He took out a known terrorist, General Soleimani, who had killed hundreds of American troops who was in the region orchestrating other forces to attack us. That's not the patterns of somebody that wants a war with Iran. Maximum pressure, absolutely. And this is a regime that deserves national--this is leading sponsor of state terrorism in the world. In the world. It has killed hundreds of American soldiers. 
So, if the president wants to play tough against people like that, I think it's the appropriate thing to do. So, I think this amendment could send the wrong message at the wrong time to a very dangerous enemy of the United States. So, for that reason, I urge its rejection. 
LOWEY: If there's no further debate, the member from California is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. First of all, let me just say there are three branches of government and the constitution requires some restrictions on the president. Once again, under Article 2, the constitution allows the president to respond to any attack on the United States or our allies. So, these arguments opposing this amendment are not making the point. 
The point is what we're doing is ensuring that we exercise our constitutional responsibility when it comes to Congress based on the restriction, based on what the founders wanted and based on what our constitutional responsibilities are, and that's to come to Congress, any president, to seek express authorization For any military authorization. And it only makes sense for us to do our job, I would think, if in fact we want to continue to be a branch of government that does have oversight responsibility over the executive branch. 
The president can play tough--any president can, and they have the authority under the constitution to do what's necessary and in defense of our country or our allies. This is about us doing our job. So, thank you, Madam Chair, And I ask for an eye vote.

LOWEY: Did everyone vote? On this vote, the ayes are 30, the nays are 22. The amendment is adopted. For what purpose does the member from Maryland rise? 
HARRIS: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. Harris amendment number two. And I would ask that the reading be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. The member from Maryland is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
HARRIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. This amendment is an amendment that the committees seen last year also, but is still--still an important amendment. It's very simple. As we know, Tricare spends billions of dollars out of the DOD budget. Those hospitals that want to contract with Tricare have to have certain quality standards. And what this amendment does, it inserts a section in the bill that would require those hospitals to certify and have policies in case of an abortion or attempted abortion the results in a child born alive. 
There would have to be policies that that infant would be taken care of and resuscitated. It's very simple. It's not--it's different from the Child Born Alive Act. There are no criminal penalties. It's just that if you want to receive money from Tricare money that you have to simply have this policy in place. There are dozens, in fact, probably many more than dozens of policies that these hospitals have to have in place that indicate quality, so this is not overly burdensome. 
You know, the argument will be made that well, you know, this--this never occurs. But in fact, over the period of 2005, 2014, the CDC identified 143 such cases in the United States. That's the CDC numbers, not--not anyone else's numbers, and that might even be an underestimate. So, this is a this is a simple way to make sure that those quality measures would be in place at hospitals that request and would receive Tricare funds. 
You know, it's particularly important because this--this issue came to light when the governor of a neighboring state of course when talking about this the--the possibility of an infant born alive after an attempted abortion said, ""If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physician said the mother."" 
Well, Madam Chair, the fact is is that the--that the--the Born Alive Infant Protection Act of 2002 clearly identifies anyone after birth to be a person, human being, child, an individual worthy of protections under the law. 
That--that bill of course in 2002 passed unanimously in the Senate on a voice vote in the House. So hopefully there is no--there's no discussion about whether that's appropriate that human being born alive qualifies as an individual with protection under the law. All this does is it says that that health care facility has to offer that individual protections, including resuscitation and care following birth. And I--I move for the amendment and yield back the time. 
LOWEY: Mr. Visclosky. 
VISCLOSKY: Madam Chair, I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment, the Born Alive Infant Protection Act of 2002 was signed into law into 2002 and provides full legal protections to all born infants regardless of their stage of development or the circumstances of their birth. I believe the amendment is redundant and I am opposed to it. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam chairman. I support the gentleman's amendment that seeks simply to protect a baby born alive after an abortion and to ensure that every possible care and protection is provided. We must have the humanity to protect living, breathing infants outside of the womb and its mother and have the courage to defend life, especially at its most vulnerable. I urge a yes vote on the gentleman's amendment. With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly support the gentleman's amendment. We have a responsibility to protect life. If a baby is born alive after an abortion, we must make sure that everything possible is done to preserve the life of the child. I urge a yes vote on this amendment and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized. 
HERRERA BEUTLER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I just wanted to urge adoption of this amendment, unfortunately because there are babies who are born alive during an abortion. And while state laws prohibit homicide, they can't clarify what is a--what a doctor is expected to do in that circumstance. And the hope here is that there is some guidance so that if this happens, which I--I'm sure is very distressing that there is some guidance for how they take care of and make sure that that baby is given the same equal medical care that every any other baby of that gestational age would be offered in a hospital setting under--it's basically there's language here that talks about the reasonable course of care, basically just making sure that there's equality under the law. 
And I--for those who are not paying attention in this issue, again, there are--there are government articles. There's--CDC did a 2003 to 2014 study. My colleague mentioned that at least 143 babies were born--born alive and subsequently died. After an attempted abortion, there's a GPO article that talks about it being an everyday occurrence. It's a little bit older. 
The state of Arizona reported 10 babies born alive in just five months in 2017 after an attempted abortion. Canada reports 491 babies were born alive during an abortion between 2000 and 2009. And there is evidence, unfortunately, that babies born alive are being killed or neglected after the fact. 
So that could--should concern everybody in this room whether you are pro-life or your pro-choice. If a baby is born alive after an abortion, they deserve constitutionally the same exact protection under the law that any other baby is--is equal to. And this is a very difficult issue. But in 2017 while answering questions about whether there were standard procedures for--for verifying if a baby was born alive and what happens after--after the fact, doctor Dr. Taylor who was an abortion provider in Arizona and California wouldn't answer the question directly. And then later observed that it depended on who was in the room. 
You know, an example, when observers do find it troubling, three former employees of an abortion clinic testified in 2013 that that doctor they worked for in Denton, Texas actively killed babies born alive during an abortion. That should terrify every single one of us. Again, it has a--whether you're pro-life or pro-choice, these--you cannot argue with this. 
You know, a Planned Parenthood representative testified in 2013 that even if a baby was born alive, the decision on what to do with the newborn, should they survive, would still be left up to the mother and the doctor. Now, while Planned Parenthood later issued a statement in response to the outrage generated by the original comments that they would provide care to the infant, the first statement--it doesn't make the first statement obsolete. 
So, this happens. It happens on our watch. It happens among us. This amendment is basically just taking that step where there are federal taxpayer dollars involved to--to Tricare beneficiaries that if that occurs that those kids who were born alive and needing medical care will have access to it. And I just--I just urge every person in this room to take a moment, whether you like that this happens or not, it recognized the truth is that it does happen and we have a responsibility to help provide guidance so that it's not on a doctors conscience or, God forbid, you know, it just a--an assistant in the room that we have taken those steps to make sure that equal protection under the law is provided. 
And we talk a lot about what types of kids are going through these instances and there's a lot of defense on access for women, women of color to have these--have this access. Well, those babies if they were born alive, regardless of their color or their station in life deserve this access to equal treatment under the law and I would urge its adoption. With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Frankel. 
FRANKEL: Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, here we go again. I will acknowledge my Republican colleagues for their persistence and a zeal in blocking access to legal abortion every which way they can. If you can't get in the front door, you go into the back door. If the back door is closed, you try to climb in a window. And if the window won't open, you slide down a chimney. And now you're stuck in a chimney because we know that this amendment fabricates a problem that does not exist. 
And law is already on the books that all health care providers have an obligation to provide an appropriate medical care to their patients. It is obvious that the motive behind this amendment is to scare health care providers, put them in fear of losing funding, and provide legal abortions to their patients. 
And this amendment, I'm sorry to say is just another tool of the Trump-Pence administration, which has since day one aggressively targeted the health rights and bodily autonomy of women. Women must be in charge of our own reproductive destiny, not to the president, not the vice president, and not any member of Congress. I oppose this amendment and I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there-- 
CLERK: --Ms.--Ms. DeLauro seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Ms. DeLauro is recognized. 
DELAURO: Thank you, Madam Chair. I rise in such strong opposition to this amendment to insert the so-called Born Alive Act. I'm going to be very blunt because this is an issue that I feel with so much conviction. This amendment is a ruse to ban safe and legal abortions in the United States. 
This amendment is a ruse because the title is a fiction. That a woman could have an abortion as she gives birth is flat out untrue. It is simply not how medicine works. I repeat, if a woman is in labor, she could not and would not have an abortion. That suggestion is not only false, it is callous. I ask those who support this amendment, where is your feeling about the deep connection that women have with child rearing? 
What about--what do you know about that sacred bond between a mother and a child? And you should know that. This amendment is not only degrading to women, it is demeaning. Abortions that occur after the first three months of a pregnancy account for only around 1 percent of all abortions, and they occur almost exclusively because the woman is at risk or her pregnancy is no longer viable. 
Think about women. It's a unique role that we have to have children. And to think that in labor we would call for an abortion. In these situations, could be life and death and time sensitive. Women and their doctors need every option possible. They do not need politicians tying a doctor's hands or shaming the woman. 
This amendment is a ruse because it is authorizing language an appropriations bill. It has no business being an appropriations bill. It is completely unnecessary because there is no similarity between safe and legal abortion and the false claims of infanticide. Let me repeat, abortion is safe and legal and, I might add, the law of the land. If there was any evidence of wrongdoing, it can and must be handled under existing law. 
Of course, if there is harm or mistreatment of newborns, it must be absolutely investigated and prosecuted. I do not think anyone in this room disagrees. But this amendment is not about that. It is part of a deliberate misinformation campaign led by the president to rouse up base voters, to interfere with medical care and intimidate doctors out of practicing. And it is, again, meant to humiliate women. 
I trust women. I trust women and their doctors, and we should trust women. Making the decision to continue or end a pregnancy is a complex medical and such a personal decision. Throughout their pregnancy, a person must be able to make health decisions that are best for their circumstances, including whether to end a pregnancy without interference from politicians. And I urge my colleagues to please oppose this amendment. I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, the member from Maryland is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
CLERK: Mr. Amodei. 
LOWEY: Who? 
CLERK: Mr. Amodei 
LOWEY: Oh, Mr. Amodei. 
AMODEI: (OFF-MIC) 
HERRERA BEUTLER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And just for the sake of clarification, and I've only got a few here, but Claire Culwell survived an abortion attempt at 22 years--22 years ago. Gianna Jessen survived an abortion attempt. Melissa Ohden survived an--an abortion attempt. Josiah Presley survived an abortion attempt. Jill Stanek survived an--so--so that last one was a nurse who talked about some of these survivors. 
So, I think I--I respect where the gentlelady is coming from, but we have to be crystal clear. Once a baby has left a mother's womb, it is not part of her body. It's a part of her heart forever. And as a mother who has had a pregnancy that was no longer viable, let me share with the committee, she actually turns seven this week. I am intimately connected with the difficulty around this decision. 
We are not talking about a woman's right to an abortion. We're talking about when the baby is born. This baby is already here and deserves medical care and I realize this is a tough one. 2006, a 23 week old baby boy was born alive at a GYN Diagnostic Center in Florida. When he began breathing and moving, the abortion clinic owner reportedly cut the umbilical cord and zipped him into a biohazard bag still alive after which he died. That was reported by NBC News. It happens. 
You're not throwing your belief about being pro-choice out the window by saying once a baby is here, we're going to protect it. It's remarkable to me that you can convolute those two arguments. It is factually inaccurate. It is scientifically inaccurate. It is, I would say morally inaccurate, but at the very least, don't use science or talk about this as--as somehow separating a woman's right to an abortion in this country. She will still have that after this bill would be passed. 
I am simply arguing for those babies who were born alive. I shared a few names there's who are alive today. It's--it's just a decision when I look at--I think about the nurse and the medical assistant, the mother and the doctor in that room, you know you talk about how a mother is going to feel, that's a pretty tough pill to swallow. I would argue that at that point when that baby deserves lifesaving care, it's not going to make it easier for the mother if that baby is--is killed. That is infanticide. It just--I feel strong very strongly that we need to be clear about the vote we're about to take. With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, and the member from Maryland is recognized in the amendment for one minute to close. 
HARRIS: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. The only deliberate misinformation here today is that this never occurs, that this somehow blocks access to abortion in any way. I urge members just read the amendment. And by the way, it's not authorizing on a--on a appropriations bill. This is not an authorization amendment. This is--this is strict limitation amendment. 
So, I know the talking points, but whoever writes those talking points, they ought to read the bill--my amendment a little more carefully. Not authorizing on an appropriations bill. This does not block access to abortion in any way. There are laws on the books, but in fact, the case of that governor across the Potomac River, it was about the passage of a bill that would actually repeal bans on third trimester abortions. And that's when that governor said that when that baby is born alive, it's up to the--that somehow people in that room are not supposed to resuscitate that baby. 
That's incredible. That's unbelievable. I've been in the recovery room for 30 years. I would never even think about not resuscitating a baby that has a heartbeat. All this says is that's got to be the standard in a Tricare hospital. That's all. I yield back my time.

LOWEY: On this vote, the yeas are 24, the nays are 28. The amendment is not adopted. For what--this is the last amendment on defense. For what purpose does the member from Florida rise? 
RUTHERFORD: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
RUTHERFORD: Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. 
[*]RUTHERFORD: Madam Chair, my amendment would strike language in this bill that restricts the Department of Defense from transferring certain surplus military equipment to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. This provision, which was also carried in the House Democrats justice and policing act reinforces a false narrative that we need to demilitarize the police. 
Since 1995, the Defense Logistics Agency has been administering military surplus program to reallocate surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies who could benefit from those added resources. Over that time, Madam Chair, over $6 billion have been saved by law enforcement agencies because they were able to take advantage of this program. In many of these cases, they were able to acquire lifesaving equipment for their officers and the citizens that they served. 
In 2015, President Obama signed an executive order prohibiting the transfer of armored vehicles and rifles from being transferred under this program. Madam Chair, those are exactly the same items in types of equipment that was used to save lives at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June of 2016. I'm sure we all remember that Pulse nightclub shooting in my home state of Florida. When a heavily armed individual murdered 49 Floridians, wounded over another 50. 
During the police response, they set off a serious series of controlled explosions called flashbangs to distract the shooter and used an armored vehicle to breach the walls of the nightclub so that they could then pin down the suspect with fire--rifle fire and extract those who were captive inside that nightclub. Saved many lives. So, we can call that military equipment. I had thought I'd call that lifesaving equipment. 
In fact, one of the officers who definitely had his life saved was shot in the head. But because he was wearing his ballistic helmet, his life was saved. If this section is signed into law, many officers may not have access to the explosives, the armored vehicles, the rifles, or the anti-ballistic helmets that save these lives on that night. Or they'll simply have to purchase them at great expense through our local, state, and federal agencies. 
The underlying provision here takes off the table resources that we've already invested in. My amendment will simply ensure that this equipment remains available as we continue to ask more and more of our law enforcement officers. 
Again, Madam Chair, this is not--this is not military equipment for our Police Department. This is lifesaving equipment. I'd shuddered to think how many more civilians and what number of officers may have had to die that night at Pulse Nightclub but for the equipment that they had available on that night. With that, I urge adoption of this amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Visclosky. 
VISCLOSKY: I am opposed to the gentleman's amendment. He mentions lifesaving equipment. I wouldn't disagree with his assertion That we ought to always look for ways to protect our law enforcement officials and first responders. That's exactly what our former colleague Frank LoBiondo and I did when we authored the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act that provides 5050 grants for local law enforcement officers to purchase vests, which as the gentleman also rightfully points out, art very expensive. 
There are other forms in which to do that. If the gentleman's amendment is adopted, the prohibitions on bayonets, that I don't quite think his life saving or grenade launchers that I don't think are quite lifesaving, grenades or silencers would also then be available. I would also point out he mentions an armored vehicle. Under the provisions of the bill, sedans and bucket trucks are available. The Secretary of Defense also has waiver authority for vehicles such as hummers an ambulance is. So, I think the gentleman overreaches and I'm opposed to his amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam chairman. I strongly support the gentleman's amendment. This amendment strikes section 8132 of the bill, a partisan rider that limits the Department of Defense ability to transfer property to state and local law enforcement agencies. Since the early 1990s, the DOD has transferred over $6 billion worth of excess or surplus equipment to state and local enforcement agencies to what is commonly referred to as the 1033 program. 
This program has been critical in ensuring our local law enforcement officers have the tools they need to protect our communities. That is why the country's leading law enforcement organizations opposed the Obama era executive order, which this section would require compliance with. According to these organizations, programs like the 1033 program has been a vital resource in allowing state and local law enforcement to acquire items used in search and rescue operations, disaster response, and active shooter situations that the they otherwise would not be able to afford. 
Furthermore, when President Trump rescinded the Obama executive order in 2017, the president of that National Sheriff's Association said that by reinstating this program, the president will provide more resources to local law enforcement to keep their communities safe without any additional cost to the taxpayer. We need to listen to those serving on the frontlines keeping our communities safe and protect that 1033 program from unfair attacks. I urge a yes vote on the gentleman's amendment and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Lawrence is recognized. 
LAWRENCE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I speak today as a member of Congress and a former mayor who had the ultimate responsibility for a trained professional Police Department. It is very clear that my colleagues on the other side had a wonderful opportunity to support the George Floyd bill that would enable us to empower our police to be a community policing agent and today, we're talking about giving them military equipment. 
The other issue I would like to really put on the minds of those who think about this horrible situation that happened, the shooting incident, we must get serious about where we are with gun control in America. And unfortunately, there's a lack of this--lack of energy or commitment to have that conversation. If we could put just as much energy in restricting the type of guns that are available in public, not to take away your Second Amendment right, but if we truly feel that military should be equipped with military equipment, then we should have a clear understanding of what the--the machinery and weapons that should be in the hands of civilians. 
As long as we have a military that we fund with all of this money from defense, then we should fund them to have military equipment and it should not be in the hands of civilians. And I just wish that we could have a real discussion about gun control in this country thank you and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger, you are recognized. 
GRANGER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly support the amendment by the gentleman from Florida. While I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns about military equipment being used in our communities, there are many more examples where the this has saved lives. In 2016, the Police Department in Texas ended a tragic shooting by using equipment that they had received through the Department of Defense. 
The shooting resulted in the deaths of four police officers and one rapid transit officer that would have been much more deadly if the police had not had access to the equipment needed to take out the shooter. It's a sad reality that many parts of this country police and first responders are often underfunded, preventing them from purchasing what they need to do their jobs. 
Prohibiting law enforcement from having access to surplus equipment is both wasteful and misguided. I thank the gentleman from his leadership on these issues and for his work as a law enforcement officer before coming to the Congress. We appreciate him sharing his expertise with us on this committee. I urge a yes vote on the amendment and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Lee is recognized. 
LEE: Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, I hope that my colleagues will oppose Mr. Rutherford's amendment. First of all, weapons of war have absolutely no place in our communities. They cause more harm than good. They divide police from the communities they are supposed to serve, and they reinforce the toxic idea that police are some sort of an occupying army. We must stop militarizing our police forces. 
Evidence has shown that law enforcement agencies that obtain military equipment are more prone to violence. The Justice in Policing bill adopted by--adopted actually representative Hank Johnson's thoughtful approach restricting section 1033. It's not a total ban on surplus equipment, but has strong restrictions that prevent anything lethal or even aggressive from being transferred. It essentially limits the transfers to equipment available for civilian use. Mind you, for civilian use, not for a war zone. 
There was agreement when writing Justice in Policing Act that Representative Johnson's language was even stronger than Obama's 2015 executive order on this issue. This defense appropriations bill carries those same strong restrictions. In response to the national outrage over police violence, armed vehicles, assault weapons and military gear recently once again these against weapons of war as we saw, they filled our streets and communities treating peaceful protesters like they were a hostile invading force rather than people asking for their rights to be respected. We need to change this dynamic. We can start by stopping the dumping of free weapons of war onto our streets. Please vote no on this amendment. Thank you and I yield. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, the member from Florida is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you, Madam Chair. (OFF-MIC) 
LOWEY: Is your mic on, sir? 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you. When I think about the officers in that North Hollywood shootout in 1997, when over 20 police officers and citizens were shot, many had to be rescued by actually bringing in an armored car from a--from a bank to get some of those people out of danger before they bled to death. It's easy to sit in this room and talk about military equipment. Trust me, when those officers are out there fighting for their lines, it's not military equipment. It's just lifesaving equipment. 
Do not turn your backs on our law enforcement men and women out there in blue. They need this equipment. It saves lives, both police and civilian. In that incident in North Hollywood, they actually had to go to a gun store. Went to a gun store to get rifles so that they could take out these two heavily armed and armored up individuals. Went on for over a couple of hours. Folks, this is not militarizing police. It is giving them the tools that they need to do their job to keep the community safe. It's not military. It's lifesaving. I urge a yes vote and I yield back.

SERRANO: Thank you, Madam Chair. As I said at subcommittee, it has been a true honor to serve with you on this committee as members from New York and as friends. Your commitment to our state and nation is unparalleled and your regular public policy accomplishments is truly outstanding. 
Of my 25 plus years on this committee, I have spent 20 on the CJS committee. It has common issues I'm passionate about with issues important to my community in the Bronx. I've loved this opportunity to finally chair it and to develop a bill that combines a justice, the environment, and economic development. These are vitally important issues, especially at this time. 
The Fiscal Year 2021 Commerce Justice Science Appropriations Bill includes a total of $71.4 billion in discretionary budget authority which is a $1.7 billion decrease below last year's level. This reflects a natural decline due to decreased need associated with the completion of the 2020 census. 
That said, at this funding level, the bill sustains strong increases to invest in promoting economic development, reducing gun violence, addressing climate change, sustaining scientific leadership and implementing police accountability and police reform. Let me go into a little more detail in some of these. Our nation is in the midst of a moment of reckoning with its history of racial discrimination, denials of civil rights, and police violence. Millions of voices crying out for justice, fairness, and most of all, change. 
That change is long overdue for the people I represent in the Bronx and for people, especially black Americans around this nation. This bill takes those voices seriously and we start the process of change. To accomplish that, the bill includes major reform efforts to enhance law enforcement accountability and to better protect civil rights. To do that, the bill increases funding for the civil rights division, the U.S. attorneys, and the FBI to conduct pattern and practice investigations of law enforcement agencies. 
We include language to rollback Justice Department policy to have hindered this oversight. The bill provides funding for a national task force on law enforcement, oversight, and national police misconduct database. In addition, the bill funds nearly $500 million for new grant programs proposed in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to drive law enforcement reforms and accountability practices. 
Lastly, we require recipients of federal law enforcement grants to implement strong state and local reform efforts if they want law federal funding for law enforcement. And by requiring those entities, we do receive (INAUDIBLE) money to set aside 25 percent of those dollars for training and accountability efforts. In sum, these changes show that the federal government is deeply serious about ensuring police and police accountability and protecting civil rights. 
The bill does things without neglecting important priorities elsewhere. We reject the president's inaudible to climate change, research programs at NASA and NOAA and instead invest in those areas. We promote economic development by supporting significant investments at the economic development administration to minority business development agency and through that manufacturing extension partnership program. 
We address gun violence by increasing ATF's budget by $150 million. We address ATF's budget by 150 million for the next programming grant and by increasing funding for the stop (INAUDIBLE) violence act, we promote criminal justice reforms with large increases for both the first step act and the second chance act. We increase funding to address the ongoing opioid epidemic. 
The bill also ensures that our nation's scientific leadership can continue by increasing funding by 270 million For the National Science Foundation by 35 million for the (INAUDIBLE) activity and buy 101.9 million for NOAA. We also include significant funding for the educational components of NASA, NSF, and NOAA to ensure we are training the next generation of scientists to continue this work. 
Before I close here, I do want to recognize the subcommittee staff and my personal staff for their work on this bill. It's been an enormous effort this year under extremely difficult circumstances. On the majority staff, let me thank our clerk, Bob Bonner as well as Jeff Ashford, B.G. Wright, Faye Cobb, Shannon McCully, T.J. Lowdermilk, and Trisha Castaneda. On the minority side, I wanted to thank Stephanie Gadbois, Kristin Richmond, and Darren Benjamin. 
I also wanted to thank my personal staff, Marcus Parsa, Anhil Giglioni, and Matt Alpert for their work as well. They are all truly remarkable. Let me also take a moment to recognize and thank the ranking member, Mr. Aderholt for his contributions and partnership on this bill. I know he doesn't agree with everything here, but I greatly appreciate his input and friendship. 
Lastly, I also wanted to recognize several members who, in addition to Chair Lowey will be retiring at the end of this Congress. Mr. Visclosky, Mr. Graves, Ms. Roby, and Mr. Hurd have all been key parts of this committee and this Congress. I will miss their experience and their kindness. 
Of course, I am retiring as well. I have loved serving on this institution and this committee. Serving here has been the honor of my life. To have gone from being born in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico to the tenements of the South Bronx to public housing in the South Bronx to New York State assembly and the halls of Congress, the American dream truly has been part of my life. 
Before I yield back, Madam Chair, I'd like to do something a little out of the ordinary. There is a member of our staff, central staff, Trisha Castaneda who is in the room. If she would stand up and wave to everybody can see her. Trisha became an American citizen last week and I think that's the kind of thing we should all celebrate and applaud on a day like today. And with that, I yield back, Madam Chair. 
(APPLAUSE) 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize the subcommittee Ranking Member, Mr. Aderholt. 
ADERHOLT: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you for your long service in this institution as well. Madam Chair, you've served this committee well and I know served many years in the United States Congress. So, I wanted to add that to the course of other comments that have been made about your fine service here. We wish you all the best and we look forward to keeping in touch. 
Also, since I didn't take the privilege but since I've got the mic now, I also want to congratulate Pete Visclosky for his--on his retirement. I have known Pete for a long time and I withheld my comments earlier just so we could move through the bill knowing that I would have a mic eventually and--but Pete and I got to know each other early on dealing with the Steel Caucus and we had that in common and worked very closely on some bipartisan issues. 
But I--of course, it goes without saying that I also want to thank Chairman Serrano and his staff for all they've done to address the parties and the concerns of members on this side of the aisle. And let me say, it's been a pleasure to work beside Chairman Serrano on this Commerce Justice and Science subcommittee bill this year and throughout our ears on the Appropriations Committee. We wish Chairman Serrano all the best as he embarks on the next chapter of his life. He has been a gentleman to work with and he will be very missed in the United States Congress. But we look forward to staying in touch and making sure that he keeps us posted on his, again, the next chapter of his career and his life. 
There are a lot of good things that's in this bill that we can agree on. I'd like to talk about a few of those things. For example, providing no less than 400 million for the block 1B version of the Space Launch System, which we commonly call SLS. And the bill conveys the important message that Congress intends for NASA to redouble its efforts to produce they block 1B. 
With its powerful exploration upper stage and the 8.4 meter payload fairing and the ability to Co manifest crew and cargo, the block 1B represents of transformational strategic capability for the United States and deep space exploration. NASA can and NASA must increase the pace of SLS acquisition to ensure an SLS is available for Europa missions in addition to meeting the needs of the human exploration program. 
SLS block 1B is also key to our national security. The government should never find itself in the now or in the future in a position of having to ask a company's permission or another country for access to space. Again, it is a national security issue. And I want to thank Chairman Serrano for agreeing to include 110 million for the nuclear thermal propulsion, a level necessary to work toward the design of a flight demonstration by 2024. 
In addition, the bill includes a strong funding for the agencies that ensure compliance with our trade laws and agreements. And I'm especially pleased that it funds the Commerce Department new aluminum imports monitoring program. I applaud President Trump's attention to this serious issue of foreign actors such as the Chinese as they are dumping subsidized aluminum into the U.S. market. 
In order to deploy this important program effectively, I urge the department to consult with the full value chain of the aluminum industry to ensure that the program protects business--businesses and workers such as those in the district I represent back in Alabama who support the full aluminum supply chain. This bill also strongly supports the administration's industries of the future initiative with new investments in quantum information science, artificial intelligence, 5G research, and advanced manufacturing. 
In addition to these key priorities, the bill addresses issues impacting all of our community, it increases funding for drug court programs and other vital initiatives that have addressed the opioid epidemic as well as it DNA programs that are helping to analyze the backlog of sexual assault evidence and solve cold cases. The bill also rightly directs the Justice Department to undertake novel approaches to addressing online child exploration--exploitation, human trafficking, and also obscenity. 
And finally, I want to thank Chairman Serrano and working with us to include 10 million for Vortex Southeast program. The southeast U.S. experience--experiences some of the most destructive, deadly, and intense tornadoes in the country. Vortex Southeast is doing critical work in helping us better understand environmental factors and improve weather forecasts communications in my home region of the South. 
However, unfortunately, strong funding in some areas make the deficiency of this bill even more glaring. The majority flatly rejects America's moon to Mars Artemis initiative and the funding needed to land the first woman on the moon. Americans are excited to see our astronauts flying to the International Space Station on American launched vehicles again and they know the strategic value of U.S. space supremacy. 
President Trump wants to re-energize America's leadership in space, and I believe that is a unifying principle and not an issue that divides this country. As--at conference time, I was hopeful we could remedy and as we move forward with conference, I hope that we can remedy some of the shortfalls in funding for ground infrastructure and human landing systems. Deficiencies that jeopardize our efforts to return to the moon. 
Worse still, this bill responds to radical demands to defend a lot of the things that the police need. None of the federal law enforcement agencies in this bill, including the FBI, the ATF, the DEA or the U.S. Marshall service artfully funded. Moreover, by imposing unauthorized conditions on the Byrne JAG and COPS programs, the majority has chosen to halt funding for many authorized programs with strong bipartisan support such as the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness act, which provides critical mental health services for officers. 
The stop violence--stop school violence act, which support purchases at school hardening equipment and active shooter training under the police act. The majority also blocks funding for anti-meth and heroin task forces. The consequences of this decision are very alarming. And I have no doubt that our side of the aisle could support bipartisan police training reforms and other timely policy initiatives, but the majority has decided to go in a different direction. 
The bill also contravenes existing law by funding lawyers for unauthorized aliens arriving at our southern border. A grant program that provides for direct legal representation of migrants at U.S. taxpayers' expense will only serve as an additional inducement for people who are considering making that dangerous journey. And it's awfully it's an awfully deadly journey North. 
It also eliminates several longstanding Second Amendment protections that have enjoyed historical bipartisan support provisions that are not even associated with criminal misuse of firearms. And it's for these reasons, Madam Chair, I look forward to our debate today and all the opportunities to improve this bill as a process as the process moves forward. 
In closing, I do also as that chairman mentioned, thank the majority staff. Bob Bonner, Jeff Ashford, Trisha Castaneda, Faye Cobb, T.J. Lowdermilk, Shannon McCully, and B.G. Wright. And of course, on our side of the aisle, the staff, Stephanie Gadbois, Darren Benjamin, and Kristin Clark along with my personal staff Megan Medley (SP) and Mark Dawson (SP) that have contributed so much over the last several months as well. So, with that, I look forward to our debate this afternoon as we move forward. And with that, I healed back. 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize myself for opening remarks. I thank Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt for their work on this bill as well as the staff crafting the product before us. Before I begin, I wanted to say a few words about my good friend, Chairman Serrano. 
In 1993, we joined the Appropriations Committee together. He has been an invaluable leader of this committee, of this Congress, and most important, a dear friend. As chairman, he has worked diligently to ensure that our census is conducted accurately and fairly. He's been a tireless advocate for the American citizens of Puerto Rico, particularly in fighting for their resources to recover and rebuild at the devastation of Hurricane Maria. 
From supporting climate change research and working to prevent gun violence to ensuring New York receives its fair share of federal funding, Joe Serrano has been a tremendously effective legislator with more than 40 years of public service to New York and as the longest serving Hispanic member of Congress. Joe has ensured that this committee is more responsive to the needs of all Americans, which is embodied in his final CJS bill, which we will consider today. 
This committee and the American people will miss his presence greatly when he retires at the end of this Congress. I will miss his smile, his sense of humor, and his good heart. My friend, it has been an honor to serve with you. 
To the build before us, as we confront the twin crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism, the American people are demanding action to build safer and stronger communities for all people. The fiscal year 2021 CJS appropriations bill recognizes and acts on the urgent need for meaningful police reform, racial justice, and the defense of civil rights for every American. Strong funding in this bill would support law enforcement reform at the state and local level while catalyzing economic development in disadvantage communities that is fundamental to a more just and equitable society. 
At a time when we must restore Americans faith in law enforcement, the Commerce Justice Science Bill provides strong funding increases to promote civil rights and improve police practices throughout the country, including more than $500 million in federal grants for States and localities to carry out police reform initiatives. These investments would bring about real change. 
Beyond this urgent responsibility, we are tasked in this bill with investing in programs that promote economic moment, keep our communities safe, reduce gun violence, and advance evidence based scientific research. This bill would do so by providing an increase of $23 million for the economic development administration to spur the economic growth of hard hit regions, increase funding for multiple programs at the Department of Justice office of on violence against women to protect that most vulnerable as our nation faces a troubling new wave of gender and domestic violence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
An increase of 9.7 million for the national instant criminal background checks to help prevent guns from entering the wrong hands and an increase of 270 million for the National Science Foundation to foster innovation And American competitiveness. I congratulate Chairman Serrano and I urge support. I would now like to recognize Ranking Member Granger for her opening remarks. 
GRANGER: I wanted to thank Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt for their work on the fiscal year 2021 Commerce Justice Science Appropriation Bill and their leadership on this committee. From efforts to combat criminal threads and protect children to programs that strengthen you as competitiveness, this bill supports many important priorities of members on both sides of the aisle. It helps our nations innovators and manufacturers and invests in cutting edge research and technology. 
I commend Chairman Serrano and Chairwoman Lowey for maintaining provisions that protect life. However, there are several items that concern me. For example, longstanding language carried for many years to protect Second Amendment rights is stripped from the bill. Also, the bill makes new investments in science, but only selectively. For example, there's not a penny more for NASA. 
Specifically, the bill fails to provide adequate funding for an essential component of NASA's Artemis program, the human landing systems on which the first woman will travel to the surface of the moon. The inadequate amount included for our lenders determines--I'm sorry, undermines prior year investment in deep space exploration. Flat funding for NASA reveals a deliberate effort to undercut our path toward renewed American space dominance. This is short sighted, to say the least. 
Sending American astronauts to the South Pole of the moon will showcase the global leadership and technological and technological advances of the United States. It will also enhance our national security by allowing us to establish a strategic presence on the moon. Our nation is facing serious threats in space, specifically from China. 
My advocacy for the Artemis program was solidified after learning about China's capabilities and their future plans. Unfortunately, the U.S. has largely fallen behind in Space Research and development and will soon be outpaced by the Chinese if we don't act immediately. Being the world leader in space will be expensive, but it won't be nearly as costly as letting China dominate us in space. 
One way to protect both our national security and our economy is to dominate--dominate space and beat the Chinese and other near peer adversaries. For far too long, we've allowed China to challenge us with negative implications both for our economy and our national security. The bill also under funds every one of the Justice Department's federal law enforcement agencies. Not one has the budget request fulfilled in this bill. 
An additional--in addition, grant funds for our state and local law enforcement partners were conditioned on policies far outside their control. The new conditions will indefinitely with holds critical active shooter response training and grants for school violence prevention measures. In addition, funding that can be used for body cameras, bulletproof vests, and investigations in overtime will be halted. 
Instead, funding is directed to a misconduct registry that could publicly report baseless accusations. This will be welcome news to any criminal looking to sideline a good officer. Unfortunately, this appears to be what defunding the police looks like. The bill demonstrates why a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on policing reform is needed for us to make real progress. Yet, an attempt to make policing reform as bipartisan as possible was already rejected in the House last month. 
Before I came to Congress, I was mayor of Fort Worth, Texas. At that time, that city had one of the highest crime rates in the nation. We took it on and had in two years that largest crime decrease in the nation. We did by that in respecting and encouraging our police by giving the equipment they needed, also encouraging them to work with citizens who wanted to save the city again and encourage businesses to provide jobs so people could provide for their families. The encouragement was given made all the difference in the world. I hope we will keep this in mind as we proceed on this bill. Thank you. 
LOWEY: Ms. Lucille Roybal-Allard seeks recognition. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD: Thank you, Madam Chair. First of all, let me just say to Congressman Serrano that it's truly been a pleasure to serve with him over the years. I wish him well and his constant voice on behalf of Puerto Rico and the territories will certainly be missed. 
I rise in support of this managers amendment and I think Chairman Serrano for including my amendment to direct and NAS study on racial and ethnic disparities in the justice system. It is well known that African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans have greater exposure to the criminal justice system than native born whites. As documented by a previous National Academy's report, these include large racial and ethnic disparities and interactions with police as well as outcomes within the justice system. 
The need to rectify inconsistencies in our justice system has gained greater attention over the last several years and the current social movement places the challenge of inequality at the forefront of criminal justice policy. This CJS bill contains funding from many outstanding programs and policies that would address different aspects of the inequalities in our criminal justice system. 
However, until now, there has not been a thorough research assessment of the inequality's, nor has there been a systematic, science based assessment of how to reduce racial and ethnic inequality's in the justice system. This NAS study would bring together bipartisan criminal justice scientists from across the country to evaluate the best scientific evidence on the racial inequality's that pervade our criminal justice system and the effectiveness of the strategies being proposed to address these problems. 
I strongly believe that a thorough assessment of the major unanswered questions on race, ethnicity, crime, and justice is essential to provide a sound knowledge based for debate and policies on crime and criminal justice as well as to ensure our criminal laws and processes facilitate rather than undermine citizenship. So, I thank you for including this request and I wholeheartedly support this managers amendment. I yield back. 
LOWEY: My colleagues, I have a list of 13 speakers. Please keep your remarks short as we still have another bill tonight. And I'm pleased to recognize Mr. Graves. 
GRAVES: Chair Lowey and Mr. Serrano, Ranking Members Granger and Aderholt, I'd like to just take a moment to thank you for working with me to include additional priorities that address our nation's cyber and telecommunications security within this bill. In the last few months, I think we've all personally seen along with the rest of our country the importance of having a reliable and secure networks available to each of us as we have transitioned to a mostly remote workforce. 
So first and foremost, these networks and the platforms, they need to be secure. That's why I've included in today's legislation language requiring the development of a secure 5G network, including technology and equipment verified to be secured from foreign surveillance. It's important that in the race to 5G, our nation remains at the forefront of innovation. But not at the expense of our personal, economic, and national security. 
While taking steps to protect our networks, we also need to make sure that the apps and the platforms we download on our personal devices don't have ties to foreign governments with a history of bad action. Last month, a major technology company found that a widely used app in the United States, which is run by a Chinese company, or a state owned entity and--has been downloaded more than two billion times globally was copying data from users' phones. Now, this data it can include it user IDs, passwords, pictures, and much, much more. 
Just last week, FBI Director Wray said that the Bureau is opening a new China related counterintelligence case every 10 hours. And this should concern all of us. That's why we are directing the Department of Justice to ban the operation of known foreign entities who actively steal data and information from our devices, the American people, or harvest personal information of American citizens on behalf of a foreign government. 
Secondly, to assist the private sector with combatting the onslaught of cyberattacks and attempted breaches, we're asking the DOJ to report to this committee on its efforts to share threat warnings and intelligence with the private sector. I might note based on information I've seen, and I'm sure that you're aware of, this is an area that certainly can be improved. Information sharing should be a two way street. 
So, you can see cyber security has certainly been up top priority of mine over the last several years and certainly as I finished my final days. And the reason is really simple. We are at a cyber crossroads in this nation. We must acknowledge that the threats that exist, they do exist, and we must lean in and we must be vigilant. So, I'm grateful to each of you for your recognition of the importance of these issues. 
So, as I close, I want to commend the majority and that minority staff for your thoughtful and effective working relationship with Ryan Dipley, the lead point person who's on my team. Ryan has been an integral part of cyber security work for several years now with me. He's one of the best. 
And again, thank you, Mr. Serrano. I appreciate your partnership. You have been a great person for me to work with over the last several years. You've been a delight to work with and all of all the best to you in the days ahead. Madam Chair, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Thank you. And Mr. Graves, I just want to thank you for your focus on cybersecurity. Your pursuing this field and sounding the alarm is so very critical to me and to all of our colleagues. And I know that you are retiring. I wish you well, but I certainly hope you will continue your important work in this area and keep this Congress informed and keep pushing us forward. Although I will be retiring as well, there aren't many people who understand the importance of this area. So, I do thank you for your leadership. Ms. Kaptur is recognized. 
KAPTUR: Thank you. Madam Chair. Chairman Serrano, your hard work and personal courage while serving as Chair of Commerce Justice Science Committee reflects--are fully reflected in this bill in service and during testimony to what an honorable, effective member can do to transform our nation one account at a time. We are so indebted to you. 
Americans from across our country, especially underrepresented communities yearn for equal justice and our nation must yield both a justice as well as economic system that is accountable to our people and systematically destroys inequalities to achieve justice. Your bill makes critical investments in this regard and programs to imagine the way our country approaches justice and public safety. It also provides for a robust economic development platforms necessary for our nation to reach deep, to meet economic inequities in the ongoing challenge of coronavirus. 
I applaud Chairman Serrano and Lowey for taking historic steps to reinvent policing. This bill connects the dots between calls for justice and a plan to level an unfair playing field for millions of our fellow citizens. Your bill provides historic funding for the civil rights division, it creates a safety net for the Department of Justice is fairness in policing program, ended provides important increases for the United States Commission on civil rights. 
This bill makes commitments to the science agencies that_ American scientific innovation. Between the National Science Foundation, that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA, your bill makes investments that will yield long-term results for our nation. Years from now as we reflect on this moment of transition, we will have your stewardship to thank for countless programs you have shepherded. 
The bill provides historic funding levels for the aeronautics and solar electric propulsion programs at NASA. These programs are about much more than reaching to the stars but about ensuring American industry can compete and innovate in a rapidly changing world. And the same goes for the Department of Commerce with key investments in that Census Bureau, the international trade administration and domestic manufacturing. 
Chairman Serrano, America thanks you for your service and for the legacy you have left across the Commerce, justice, and science agencies to strengthen our nation from stem to stern. May God be with you. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Rogers is recognized. 
ROGERS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to applaud both Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt. You put together I think it great bill to ensure many of the priorities that we on this committee and the Congress in general have. 
I want to say especially a few words regarding Joe Serrano and follow up on the great tribute that the chairman of the committee just gave to our friend I've had the pleasure over the years of working with Joe Serrano on this subcommittee for years. Either I was chairman or he was. I was ranking member or he was. And we--we enjoy each other's company and we differed on some issues, but overall, we--we shared the same commitment to this country and the elements in this bill that makes it great. 
So, he's the only member of Congress I think, Madam Chair, that has two districts. His district in New York and Puerto Rico. He was always a great booster of his native land. So, Joe Serrano, good luck to you. We hope you will come back and visit us after you leave the Congress at this--end of this session. And we've enjoyed your company all throughout. 
I want to specifically thank both of these gentlemen for continuing to provide very robust funding to combat the nation's opioid epidemic. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got an epidemic going on within the pandemic, and it's the old problem of the opioid crisis that's rearing its ugly head again. It spiked--the deaths have spiked high in the last few weeks within the pandemic that's going on with COVID-19. 
There's $31 million in the bill for the PDMP grant program, there's 85 million for drug courts, 34 veterans treatment courts, 35 for that residential substance abuse treatment or state prisoners program. This funding quite literally saves lives and I applaud--I applaud you for your commitment to these programs. 
I'm concerned about new preconditions in the bill, but I think will be brought up in one of the amendments later on I guess by Mr. Rutherford. Preconditions that would hold up funding for many very important and vital Department of Justice grant programs. I appreciate the intent conditioning support for combatting the illegal manufacturing distribution of heroin and methamphetamines, for example. It's dangerous and puts even more Americans at risk. 
These preconditions to grants may be well intentioned, but I believe they will do much more harm than good. So, we'll hear more about that in a few minutes. Until we can address this issue among others, I have to say, even though I like the bill, there are parts of it that I cannot tolerate and will have to vote no. With that. Madam Chair, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Lee is recognized. 
LEE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Let me thank Chairman Serrano and our Ranking Member Mr. Aderholt for their leadership in putting this bill together. I too wanted to thank our Chairman Jose Serrano for his leadership and his friendship. Jose, you have been a very steady committee chair. 
You've led with steadiness and compassion. You've been fair and you've been principled. And I've enjoyed your stories about musicians and baseball players, especially your stories about Frank Sinatra. I've learned a lot from you and will miss you here in Washington DC, but I hope that our friendship will continue. 
This bill comes in the midst of a global pandemic, an ongoing movement against police brutality and systemic racism, environmental racism, and an economic crisis, which disproportionately impacts black and communities of color. The unjustness--excuse me. The unjust treatment of black Americans and other people of color by some police officers in communities throughout this nation is something that the demands immediate reforms from this committee. I'm pleased to see that much of the language in Chairwoman Bass' George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is reflected in these--in this appropriations bill. 
The policing institutions in our country are deeply entrenched in racism and brutality and we cannot allow it to continue. These inherently systemic issues require us to reinvest into programs that will keep our communities safe and help them thrive and I believe that this bill is a step in that direction. Communities of color are reevaluating what public safety means due to the lack of safety and systemic racism. 
This funding bill creates opportunities and accountability by creating guidelines on state and local funds to help protect our communities and limit police misconduct. I was also pleased to see 25 million for grants took community based organizations to study and, yes, implement effective management training, recruiting, highlighting and oversight standards and programs to promote effective community and problem solving strategies for law enforcement agencies. 
I'm also pleased to see increased funding for evidence based recidivism, the programs with--excuse me, 165 million for the first step act and 100 million for a second chance grant. Additionally, I'm glad to see increased funding to reform law enforcement with specific emphasis on the 50 million to address racial profiling implicit bias, de-escalation, and the use of force. This pivotal point in history has continued to highlight the need for substantial change to policing policies. 
Finally, I think that share for including important language that would prohibit the Department of Justice from interfering in access to medical marijuana in the states, the District of Columbia, and territories where it is legal. As the Co-chair of the bipartisan cannabis caucus, this language is critical to ensuring that the federal government does not vamp on what states are doing in terms of full legalization or the legalization of medical marijuana. 
So, I'm in strong support of this bill. I look forward to your bringing it to the floor. Mr. chairman, I will miss you deeply and I want to thank you for your wisdom and your leadership. Thank you and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Rutherford. You are recognized. 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt for this bill that is--I support many elements within. However, I do rise in opposition as it's currently written. I--I feel that it's actually going to do some--inadvertently do some irreparable harm to our local law enforcement agencies across the country. 
Over Memorial Day, we--we all watched in horror at the George Floyd murder and now these officers--those officers will be held accountable. The events of that weekend began a bipartisan conversation on law enforcement reform reforms, many of which I do support. However, I was disappointed that despite there being bipartisan agreement on many of those issues, we did not vote in a bipartisan bill in HR 7120. 
I continue to be disappointed and they partisanship of this bill today. While this bill includes 525 million for Byrne JAG and 343 million for community oriented policing, the riders included will very likely prevent agencies from accessing any of that money. This bill holds funding from agencies for many things that are outside of their control. For example, look at--look at the carotid and chokehold policy tide to the federal funding. 
And I will tell you at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office that I--that I led for 12 years, chokeholds and carotid holds were not allowed except in lethal force applications. Yet--so they are against our agency policy and have been for many years, but under this bill, in order to get crucial federal funding, Jacksonville's local government would need to pass a law banning something that's already banned in policy. 
This requirement leaves police officers and their safety at the mercy of local legislature in their processes, which are as you know, slow and burdensome. In addition to imposing requirements that are out of in agencies control, this bill mandates that many jurisdictions pay for expensive accreditation and data collection before they're able to qualify for federal funding. 
Now, I'm a huge proponent of accreditation. In fact, the agency where I was sure of, we had all three national accreditations. CALEA, ACA, NCCHC. We had all of those. And I--but I can also attest that it's incredibly expensive and labor intensive with several hundred standards for each of those. 
But here is the catch 22. How can we expect agencies across the country currently facing extreme budget cuts to meet these requirements without our help and without federal funds being available? The bottom line is this bill tries to straddle the fence by appearing not to defund the police while actually doing exactly that, making this vital federal funding nearly impossible to access. 
Without federal dollars, police jurisdictions both large and small will struggle to keep their communities safe. These riders prevent us from doing what our constituents expect, and that's working together to uphold the highest standards of law enforcement training and policies. I hope that we can move forward and--and work in a bipartisan manner. But as it stands now, Madam Chair, I have to oppose this bill. I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Case, you are recognized. 
CASE: Thank you, Madam Chair. And to my subcommittee chair Mr. Serrano as well as Mr. Ranking Member Aderholt for bringing this fiscal year 2021 Commerce Justice Science bill before the committee today. Chair Serrano, it has been my privilege to serve with you on your subcommittee during my first term on the Appropriations Committee. The wise and gracious leadership you have provided has been a deep education for me and is a lasting lesson for us all. 
I support this bill and am struck all over again by the breadth of its reach. For it not only advances so many vital programs that are of critical importance, not just to our constituents and communities and country, but it goes so much further to the health and well-being of our natural world and to understanding the deepest mysteries of our universe. 
Of note, to support the economic development of our communities, this bill includes a $23,000,000 increase for the economic development administration, which does so much good work in our communities. Additionally, to support minority owned businesses, which have been disproportionately hit by the economic impacts of COVID-19, the bill includes a $10 million increase to the minority business development agency. 
Under the Department of Justice, this bill continues strong support for key law enforcement initiatives across the country such as community oriented policing along with important justice grant programs that our communities rely on such as violence against women act grants, grants that reduced the backlog of sexual assault kits, stop school violence grants, victims of trafficking grants, second Jack--second chance act programs and missing and exploited children programs. It also includes provisions to promote many of the reforms that were included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, including funding for independent investigation of law enforcement for community based organizations and improving law enforcement and to improve reporting on the use of force to comply with consent decrees, and other reform measures and create local task forces on public safety innovation, to name a few. 
The bill also includes critical continued investments in that national air aeronautics and space administration and the national space science foundations. These will pay dividends for decades to come. I especially want to highlight support for our world's endangered oceans. Representing the island state of Hawaii, surrounded on all sides by the largest ocean of all, our ocean effects every--every community throughout our Pacific in myriad ways and the importance of our federal investment in management and research of this and all oceans cannot be understated. 
The FY20 21 CG S bill meets these needs with 5.45 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or at NOAA, which is 101.9 million above the FY20 20 enacted level and 829.2 million above the administration's frankly paltry request. This will enhance support for the conservation of our coral reefs, our sanctuaries and marine protected areas, coastal zone management, protection of our marine mammals and sea turtles, ocean exploration and research, marine debris removal, tsunami warnings, the sustainable management of our fisheries, climate change and sea level rise mitigation and much more. 
Speaking of Climate change, this bill also supports the continued advancement of cutting-edge research and observations of our atmosphere. In Hawaii, we are home to the NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory, which is provided the measurements of the level of carbon dioxide in--in our atmosphere for over 60 years now. Measurements that are the bases of the world-renowned healing curve proving accelerating climate change beyond any reasonable scientific doubt, whose data is also used and relied upon by more than 500 external partners and stakeholders, internationally. 
This bill further upgrades the capabilities of the Mauna Loa Observatory and NOAA's other atmospheric baseline observatories; to ensure we always have an accurate and current understanding of exactly how our atmosphere is changing and to do what we can and must, to address and reverse such change. In closing, I again thank Chair Serrano for your leadership on this very important bill and urge my colleague's support. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: My colleagues the hour is getting late, we still have another bill. I would like to give each person the ability to speak, but if you can limit voluntarily, your remarks to two minutes, we can move along. I'm not asking all in favor, but I think most people would be in favor. Ms. Herrera Butler is next, thank you. 
HERRERA BEUTLER: Thank you, Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt for including a priority of mine, in this bill, that's going to directly benefit the salmon and steelhead runs in the Pacific Northwest. Specifically, the CJS bill before us today includes $23 million for Mitchell Act Hatcheries, that's a $1 million dollar increase over enacted, to protect Pacific salmon runs and improved hatchery production of salmon and steelhead, in the Columbia River system. 
This funding helps the state of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, operate a series of hatcheries and fish passage facilities improving declining salmon runs in the Columbia River system. This funding is absolutely critical to ensure the conservation of these important fish species, maintain economically viable tribal commercial and sports fisheries, and provide prey for southern resident killer whales. 
I'm also pleased to see continued support for the Pacific Salmon Treaty and Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, since 2000, the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund has restored over 1.1 million acres of salmon habitat. And, opened over 10,900 miles of streams to spawning fish. The Pacific Salmon Treaty provides the important framework for Canada and the U.S., to cooperatively manage Pacific salmon stocks, focused on protecting and expanding spawning habitat, increasing hatchery production, and implementing conservation measures to prevent overfishing and maximize production. 
It's an important investment that this committee makes in these programs, that are so crucial to our salmon and steelhead recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest. Thank you again to the chairman and of course the ranking member; both the majority in the minority committee staff for their incredibly hard work on this bill. And, for including these important measures. With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Thank you. Ms. Torres is recognized. 
TORRES: Thank you, Chairwoman Lowey. And, thank you, Chairman Serrano, for your manager's amendment, which includes a provision that I requested. Last month, I led 27 fellow Democrat lawmakers in a letter to the Department of Justice concerning a 2006 FBI intelligence assessment, on white supremacist infiltrating law enforcement. This assessment describes a threat that is terrifying and dangerous, especially for Black and Brown communities. 
And, as the 2006 report points out, it can jeopardize the safety of law enforcement, as well. While this was 14 years ago, concerns remain. In 2015, a lead research on domestic terrorism in the Department of Homeland Security warned about the same threat. We need to know about the state of this threat now, in 2020. And, we need to know what DOJ and the FBI have done about it. Even if it's nothing. 
This manager's amendment does just that. It directs the FBI to provide an update on its assessment on white supremacy and law enforcement. And, what the Department and FBI have done, since 2006, to address these concerns. Given the moment of reckoning in racial justice that we're in right now; there is no reason at all, not to update this inquiry immediately, so it can inform our dialogue on how we bring about true reform, in policing. 
And, in closing, Madam Chair, I want to take a moment to thank my friend, Mr. Serrano, Chairman Serrano for his leadership not only in this committee but also in the natural resources committee, where I served with him. I truly appreciate your support and mentorship over the years. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Watson Coleman is recognized. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And, thank you so much Chairman Serrano and Ranking Member Aderholt, for their leadership of bringing this very important bill to the committee today. The need for criminal justice reform heads were really been so acute as it is at this moment. The light that recent events has shown on the disparate treatment of black people and all people of color should push us to change the way we think, the way we write our policies, the way we approach our roles in a system that is always used race, to hold people back. 
And, this bill moves in the right direction. I'm particularly happy that we have information in this bill, that implements several aspects of the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. I'm not going to read them off because of the interest of time. I'm also interested and happy to see that while our money where we place is a reflection of our values; the fact that we don't put our money with bad actors, is also a reflection of our values. 
And, we will hold the local communities out to the promises of equal opportunity, fairness in policing, and adhering to the policies that will make illegal the chokeholds and the boundaries for the use of lethal force, etc. I would not be--I would be remiss if I didn't also say that, I'm grateful to see the $6 million dollars that is allocated to research the intervention and prevention of domestic radicalization. Particularly, as we look at the Dylann Roof and Robert Bowers and what they did to innocent black communities, and innocent synagogue attendees. 
Before I close, I want to thank the chair particularly for working with me on language that would require the Department of Justice to collect data on where the schools receiving grants for school resource officers; ensure that they do not infringe upon the civil liberties of their students. I am particularly pleased that we are recognizing the systemic racism that has been accorded our young--young people, as well as our older African Americans. 
And, that we are moving forward in a progressive an--an appropriate manner to address the effects of 400 years of history. Thank you and with that, I congratulate my Chairman on his retirement. And, I pray God--Godspeed and God bless. Thank you. With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cartwright is recognized. 
CARTWRIGHT: Thank you Madam Chair. Before we consider the fiscal year 2021 CJS bill, I wanna take a moment again, to thank Chairman Serrano, my friend, my mentor, on this subcommittee, for his exceptional service. We will always remember you for your love of the people of the Bronx, the people of America, and particularly, the people of the territory of Puerto Rico, that enchanted archipelago, to which your heart is ever turning. 
I also want to thank my fellow members at the CJS subcommittee and particularly, Ranking Member Aderholt for his hard work on this bill. There are many important priorities in the bill that will bring real benefits to Americans across the nation, for workers and families, in districts like my own, in northeastern Pennsylvania. This bill includes a 23 percent increase to the assistance to coal communities' program, which will meet--will bring needed jobs to former coal communities. 
The bill also increases funding for climate research, so we can make decisions based on solid science, going forward. It takes important steps to prevent opioid abuse, reduce gun violence, and improve school safety. It works to combat child predators through the increased funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces, which are on the front lines, of halting the despicable spread of child abuse, on the Internet. 
And, it addresses the dangerous practice within federal prisons, we fund the Bureau of Prisons, within the federal prisons is the practice of assigning support staff to perform correctional officer duties, referred to as augmentation. Counting psychologists and art teachers as--as correctional officers, is wrong and it's fudging the numbers. Staffing shortages in prisons contribute to overcrowding and violence. And, these additional resources improve the safety and security of both staff and inmates. 
Finally, this bill helps all Americans feel safe in their communities. I want to be very clear; this bill puts the much-needed funding toward our nation's police departments and provides critical resources to improve the training of law enforcement officers. It also offers common-sense bipartisan policing reform solutions. This is an important bill with far-reaching benefits that we can all be proud to support. I again thank my fellow members of the subcommittee, staff, and again, the chairman, for his exemplary leadership on the fiscal year 2021 CJS Appropriations Bill. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. DeLauro is recognized. 
DELAURO: Thank you Madam Chair. I want to first say thank you to Chairman Serrano, Ranking Member Aderholdt, for the bill and take a moment to commend the distinguished and departing Chair, Jose Serrano. We joined the Congress at similar times, similar convictions, but the government's obligation to create an opportunity for all. And, that includes people of color. Born in Puerto Rico, Chairman Serrano fought for Americans of color and for Latin X Americans throughout his tenure. 
Including, during his time as chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. I have been proud to fight with him, to close his disparities this virus, in particular, has exposed. And, recently on the issue of family separation at our southern border. The inhumanity of that administration policy was not just that it failed as a public policy, but that it also failed our morality, as a nation and it failed the well-being of children. 
I cheer the Labor-HHS Services-Education subcommittee in part, because of Jose Serrano. 25 years ago, when we were selecting committee assignments, there was one slot left. And, since he was ahead of me in seniority, I said, oh my gosh, he is going to take the spot-on Labor-HHS. I still feel really, today, that the Lord was watching over me. And, I prayed he would decide to go elsewhere. And, he did. And now, we are here. 
We've been able from our past advantage points to make a difference in the lives of the people of our communities and in our country. And, yes, he is a New York Yankee fan and Frank Sinatra fan. So, there. Let me thank the chairman and the committee for--for his commitment partnership. We secured three important provisions for local community safety, to allow and encourage our communities first responders, to use Byrne JAG funds to purchase gunfire detection software programs, to help first responders respond to gunfire incidents more quickly and arrive at the scene more quickly. 
Second, to address crumb--crumbling infrastructure, specifically concrete foundations at risk because of elevated levels of pyrite, which can cause concrete foundations to become structurally unsound; a big problem in our state, and what we can do to slow, delay, or stop such damage. And third, for equal pay, to require the EEOC to analyze and release a public report about pay information collected through the revised EEOC one form. 
Let me close by thanking the chairman for his leadership, commitment, you made change for your community and our country. We owe you our thanks for the work you did on this bill, but the work that you have done to bring this country much closer to its loftiest ideals. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Kilmer is recognized. 
KILMER: Thank you, Chair Lowey. And, I want to echo the gratitude displayed to the--to Chairman Serrano. It was an honor for me to serve on his subcommittee, and I appreciated his kindness and concern for my constituents and wish him the best. I also want to thank a Ranking Member Aderholt and of course the committee staff, for the work on this bill. And, I want to speak specifically to the investments made in this bill for salmon recovery. 
In my neck of the woods, salmon are the lifeblood of our region's economy and identity. This bill includes funding to meet our obligations under the newly ratified Pacific Salmon Treaty, investing in key recovery efforts, like habitat restoration, hatchery production, and sound science. That's essential to recovering orca and supporting tribal, commercial, and recreational fisheries throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
Like Representative Herrera Beutler, I am also grateful that the committee included an increase in funding for Mitchell Act Hatcheries, which play an integral role in meeting our region salmon recovery goals. And finally, I want to thank the chair, ranking member, and the committee staff, for the ongoing commitment to working with me to secure additional direct assistance to the fishery participants in further disaster supplemental legislation. The economic relief for seafood dependent businesses in the CARES Act, was a drop in the bucket, compared to the need. 
And, NOAA has struggled to release this funding, in a timely and equitable manner. These businesses are still waiting on this relief. In addition, the allocation for West Coast Tribes fell woefully short of the impacts felt by these communities. So, I appreciate the inclusion of additional report language in the manager's amendment, recognizing this shortcoming and reminding NOAA of its responsibility to uphold federal treaty and trust obligations, during all engagements with tribal interests. 
Our nation's seafood industry has been particularly hard hit, during this pandemic. This is especially challenging for a region like mine, where tribal and rural economies are directly tied to the success or failure of this keystone industry. Congress needs to provide more dedicated relief to ensure our fishing-dependent communities, survive this crisis. I want to thank my colleagues on this committee, from both sides of the aisle, including my friends, Representative Herrera Beutler and Representative Pingree, who share my commitment to supporting our fishing-dependent communities in future coronavirus relief legislation. 
Though recovery will require more, the investments made in this bill today, move us in the right direction and demonstrate the committee's continued commitment to recovering salmon and the tribal and rural economies that depend on healthy salmon populations. Thank you, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cuellar is recognized. 
CUELLAR: Thank you Madam Chair and I also want to thank Mr. Jose Serrano. He's smart, he's passionate, and he's got the one of the best sense of humor of anybody we know. So, I want to thank the chairman on his retirement. I also want to thank the Ranking Member, Mr. Aderholt, for the work that he's done working together, bipartisan. I just want to mention a couple things. I want to thank the committee for adding money to hire another 100 immigration judges, support staff, and associate facilities. 
I want to thank him because, in the short three years, I think we've added more immigration judges then at any other time in history. I also want to thank him also for the funding on police reform. I also want to thank him for the money for drug courts. I also want to thank him for the monies for the court-appointed special advocate's program. And again, I just want to say thank you, for Mr. Aderholt and my good friend, Jose. Since the last time I saw him in that order--law and order, as playing as a judge, I've never been the same. So, I want to say thank you. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LOWEY: And, Mr. Crist is recognized. 
CRIST: That's pretty good. Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I'd like to commend you for your incredible career and service to our country, God bless you for all of that. I want to thank Chairman Serrano for his leadership on our subcommittee; done an extraordinary job and you will be missed as well, my friend. First, I thank the chair for including my request to $14 million for NOAA, to address harmful algae blooms that have affected my state. 
The $30 million included in this bill for the courts, will provide our nation's bravest with proactive treatment options, helping them to avoid jail. This is under the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act. And, I can't thank you enough for that support. I also commend the inclusion of my request for report language, directing the FBI to take meaningful action, to address guardianship fraud, and to protect our seniors from exploitation. 
And finally, I'd like to voice my strong support for the important work that NASA is doing. Including their quest to land the first woman on the moon and the next man on the surface of the moon, throughout the Artemis program. Florida's blessed to be home to both NASA's Kennedy Space Center and a thriving commercial space industry. 
Space is a part of Florida's culture, economy, and our way of life. This is a tough year because of all the competing priorities, but we came through. It's critical that Congress continue to support NASA's mission and push the boundaries of space exploration and scientific achievement. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield back. And, I thank you Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: And, Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you, thank you Madam Chair. I wanna add my congratulations and let him know how much he will be missed to those that have--have said goodbye to our dear colleague, Congressman Serrano. As a native New Yorker and lifelong Yankee fan, now, of course, the Marlins fan, I've appreciated his passion for the Bronx Bombers and for the Bronx. 
A little-known fact perhaps, a lot of his loves have been noted, but he was in spite of being likely considered old school, he was really the earliest adopter that I can think of--of the iPad. And, I remember peering over his shoulder on the House floor when--when he first got his iPad. And, getting lots of important advice from him on how to make the work that I do, more efficient. So--so I will--I will miss those--that--that kibitzing, as we say in --in our--our Jewish vernacular, with him. 
And--and also, the corny jokes. Because there really isn't anyone that can hold a candle to Jose Serrano when it comes to corny jokes. There's also no one can--that can hold a candle to him on his passion for his constituents and also for the work that he did so well, in putting together this bill. I want to commend him and Ranking Member Aderholt for--for a really excellent bill. 
The legislation reinforces the reforms within the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act by funding pattern and practice investigations, enforcement of consent decrees, a police misconduct registry, body-worn cameras, and other measures that are designed to address abuse in police department's and promote racial justice. Since the Senate, unfortunately, has expect--expressed a bewildering unwilling--unwillingness to even consider the Justice in Policing Act; I hope we can move some of these urgent reforms through the appropriations process. 
I'm particularly pleased and thankful that this bill includes language from my Police Accountability and Community Engagement Act, the PACE Act, which I introduced with Congressman Hastings. Our legislation seeks to disrupt the cycle of disconnection between police and communities of color, and lead to actionable steps to improve coordination and safety between the police and the people they serve. 
And further, I'm encouraged to see that the bill before us also addresses the growing problem of domestic terrorism and white nationalist extremism, by providing $6 million for domestic rattle--radicalization research. I'm also proud to have partnered with my fellow appropriator in the Co-chair of the congressional caucus, on black Jewish relations, Brenda Lawrence, to secure $8 million dollars for the first time for Matthew Shepard Hate Crime and Prosecution Grants, that have been authorized but never funded, to help states and local governments conduct educational outreach and training on hate crimes. 
And, investigate and prosecute these crimes. Unfortunately, our nation needs this kind of support in these trying times, and under the current leadership in the White House. The bill also addresses the recent explosion of online child exploitation by increasing funding for missing and exploited children programs. And, carving out specific funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces, to take on proactive investigations that have demonstrated potential to rescue children. 
While I wish that ICAC were funded at the fully authorized level of $60 million; I understand the budget constraints that the subcommittee had to work with. Additionally, we invest further in the safety of our children by increasing the Stop School Violence Act Grant funding, for schools to implement evidence-based programs--programs, training, appropriate school hardening measures, and other steps that are necessary to improve school safety and security. 
And, I'm encouraged by what this bill does for marine conservation and ecosystem protection, it's including $34 million for the coral reef program and $22 million for competitive external research to boost funding and partnerships with academic institutes, to figure out and stop coral bleaching diseases that are decimating Florida's reef ecosystems. And, also $14 million specifically for harmful algal bloom research; this is much appreciated because every year algal blooms are posing a greater and greater threat to Florida's coast, tourism industry, and public health. 
Florida cannot afford more summers like 2018, and the funding in this bill will help us better understand harmful algal blooms and how to stop them. Thank you again, to Chairman Serrano. I wish you the best and hasta luego, my friend. 
LOWEY: Ms. Lawrence, you are recognized. 
LAWRENCE: Thank you Madam Chair. And, to the Chairman Serrano, just thank you for your leadership and to the ranking member. I am so excited that this bill provides for the Violence Against Women Act programs, millions of dollars for victims of trafficking grants. It is very important that we fund our values. I also want to say as the co-chair of the bipartisan and Democratic women's caucus, I'm thrilled to support for best--robust funding that will put a woman on the moon. We're talking about putting them--putting--going back to the moon. 
But this will be historic, by putting a woman on the moon. Also, as the co-chairs of the congressional caucus on black Jewish relationships, along with my colleagues Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Will Hurd, I am proud to see $8 million for grants authorized under the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to help states and local government investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
Lastly, I want to thank the committee for including funding for NIST, we know that in America and in the robust and aggressive advancement of AI, is lacking that critical, ethical, development of technology. And so, to invest in that, where we can say that as we--as this country moves forward with artificial intelligence, that we do in America, expects us to have ethical standards for it. I support this bill and I encourage my colleagues. I think I made my 2 minutes. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: My colleagues, before I turn this back to Mr. Serrano, our extraordinary chair, to offer the manager's amendment; I just want to alert you, that I am going to assess our progress at about 6:00 PM, because we may have to take a dinner break. So, keep that in mind, as we move forward. And, we'll make the judgment at 6:00 o'clock and see where we are. Mr. Diaz-Balart, do you have a question? 
DIAZ-BALART: Actually, I have a brief comment if I may, but I will be quick if that's alright, Madam Chairwoman. I also wanted to thank Chairman Serrano for his help with the school safety funding in this bill. He took great interest, met with my friend, our friend Max Schachter (SP), and once again stepped up to the plate. 
But I just want to also stop a rumor, right now. I wanna make sure that everyone understands that that rumor out there, that says that--that Mr. Serrano named the bill CJS after Congressman Jose Serrano, is not true. It was CJS before he got the chairmanship. So, I want to put that rumor to bed right now, thank you. I yield back. 
(LAUGHTER) 
LOWEY: Your wisdom is always welcome, my friend. Now, seeing no other member wishing to make opening remarks, I'd like to recognize Mr. Serrano to offer a manager's amendment. Mr. Serrano, my friend. 
SERRANO: Let me first say, Mr. Diaz-Balart that I wrote that joke 20 years ago. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Just a coincidence, CJS and Congressman Jose Serrano's is just a coincidence. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask that the reading be disposed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading is dispensed with. 
SERRANO: Dispensed with. 
LOWEY: And, you are recognized, Mr. Serrano. 
SERRANO: Madam Chair, this is a manager's amendment, consisting of various countries--non-controversial changes to the bill and report. The amendment has been cleared with the minority and I urge its adoption. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ranking Member Aderholt is recognized. 
ADERHOLT: Thank you Madam Chair for yielding. I want to thank Chairman Serrano for working with us and the rest of our committee colleagues, to address some noncontroversial bipartisan improvements to the bill and report. So, I support the amendment and urge its adoption, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Are there any other members who wish to be heard on the amendment? Mr. Price, I understand you want to be heard. 
PRICE: Thank you Madam Chair. I do rise in support of the manager's amendment. And, also to add to the many sincere tributes being offered to Chairman Joe Serrano. Joe's one of the most collegial and the best-liked members of the House, including by me. And, he's been a voice of--of conscience on matters of human dignity and equality, and on the importance of full inclusion of the territories in our legislation, and in federal benefits, including, of course, Puerto Rico. 
I know I think more about those things because of his admonitions. And, I expect we all do. So, Joe is a great friend and a great chairman, a great member, and we--we all wish him the very best. I want to speak on this manager's amendment, very briefly, because it includes a provision that seeks to provide oversight and accountability for the Bureau of Prisons, as it institutes home confinement policies to help combat the COVID-19 risks in federal prison facilities. And, those risks are severe. 
In North Carolina, just north of my district, COVID-19 has hit the button or federal prison facility hard. They have 900 cases in that prison, among inmates, and they have 60 among staff, 25 inmates incarcerated individuals, have died, and one staff member have died. This virus spreads rapidly in areas of confinement, nowhere more than in prisons. And, we've got to do everything we can to prevent this further spread. 
So, we do have details that the attorney general has--detailed guidelines that the attorney general has issued for compassionate relief, which often is a way to deal with this. In the CARES Act in the First Step Act, quantified standards around home confinement. But the number of incarcerated individuals who've been released has not matched the eligibility, nor the need, for fewer persons to be in these facilities to stem the spread of the virus. 
Each day staff members at our federal prisons must return home to their families, despite being a significant risk by the sheer numbers of people they come into contact with every single day. Incarcerated people in federal facilities are serving their time under the custody of the care of the federal government. 
The Bureau of Prisons must uphold their duty and follow protocol to release eligible incarcerated persons. So, I thank the chair and the ranking member for recognizing this dire need, taking account of it in the manager's amendment. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: I recognize Mr. Serrano for one minute to close. 
SERRANO: I'll take less than one minute. The amendment is agreed to buy the minority and with that in mind, I hope everybody can vote for it. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: The question is on the amendment. All those in favor say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Those opposed, say no. In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. Are there any further amendments? What purpose does the member from Oklahoma rise? 
COLE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
COLE: I would ask that the reading be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. And, the member from Oklahoma is recognized for five minutes, on the amendment. 
COLE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Madam Chair, the federal government gives money to state and local law enforcement, because it chooses to do so. But in the case of tribal law enforcement, it does so because it has to do so. It's required to do so, by treaty and by trust responsibility. Now, normally law enforcement is funded through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
But we all know despite the very best efforts of a succession of really good chairman, one of whom happens to be sitting immediately to my right; the tribal law enforcement funding is woefully inadequate. If you actually looked at the statistics, rural tribes have about 1/3 the number of police officers, per square mile, then other parts of rural America have to cover them. And, the distances can be vast. 
So, in addition to BIA funding, tribes do apply for some of these other programs, COPS programs, those sorts of things. And, every time you add additional conditions for them to meet, you make it harder for them to create. Unfortunately, many of the agencies that make these decisions don't know very much about tribes and don't know, frankly, very much about the trust responsibility of the treaty obligation, that the United States government has. 
And, that's a problem in and of itself, in getting inadequate resources. But, in addition to that, I, you know, by adding more strings to a department that are frankly dealing with a unique set of problems, you really are sort of putting apples and oranges into the same barrel. Let me give you a couple of examples. 
You know, probably the biggest single problem aside from resources in tribal law enforcement is jurisdiction; exactly what kind of jurisdictions these departments have, over whom, on what territory? No other police department's really face anything quite like tribal Police Department do, in that--in that regard. And frankly, they ought to be exempt from meeting all of these conditions. Some of the conditions are simply not applicable. 
As a number of you have remarked to me, and in good faith, look, not to be disrespectful because I think racial profiling is a big problem in lots of America, not a big problem on Indian reservations. You know, it's just a different set of standards. 
So, I would ask rather than complicate it for law enforcement in Indian country, we pull out tribal law enforcement and just let them continue to apply and compete for these grants, with another set of conditions, another set of standards, is not likely to change things for the better in Indian country. 
Quite frankly, it'll make already underfunded police officers or police law enforcement, excuse me, underfunded law enforcement units, less able to get the resources they need to provide a minimum of security for their--the constituencies that they serve. So, with that Madam Chair, I yield back my time. 
LOWEY: And, Mr. Serrano is recognized. 
SERRANO: Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The CJS funding bill does the urgent and necessary process of change, by focusing on police accountability, civil rights, and justice for all. All includes (INAUDIBLE) within our beloved country and its territories. Traveling operator law enforcement agencies, provide a broad range of public safety services, such as responding to calls for service, investigating crimes, enforcing traffic laws, executing arrest warrants, serving process, providing court security, and conducting search and rescue operations. 
The conditions placed on the receiving Byrne JAG or COPS funding provides a guarantee that those public safety services will meet the same standards that we want for all our citizens. No longer will we stand by and allow different policing for one set of citizens over another. I urge a no vote and I must say to Representative Cole that I would like to think I've been supportive of many, if not all, of his issues regarding the tribal community. 
Because I am supportive of getting a better situation for them, but this is one where we want to put everyone under the same banner and we want a better Police Department and better-policing policy for all, and all means everybody. So, I urge a no vote. Thank you. 
LOWEY: Mr. Aderholt is recognized. 
ADERHOLT: Thank you Madam Chair. I support the gentleman's amendment. Across the country there are 757, I'm sorry 574 federally recognized tribes, that depend on the Department of Justice grants, to improve their public safety, to serve victims of crime, to combat violence against women, and support youth programs. And, as Mr. Cole are referred to in his comments in parts of Indian country this funding especially is critical, given that 911 response times are measured in hours or days, instead of minutes. 
And, the American Indians and the Alaskan natives experienced much higher per capita rates of violence, than the general population. Therefore, the fact that this new bill provision attaches even more strings and conditions to these important grants, actually moves us in the wrong direction, when it comes to helping tribes. So, we should be looking for ways to provide more help, not an additional burden. So, I would urge a yes, on this amendment. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger you are recognized. 
GRANGER: My friend, Mr. Cole is an expert on tribal issues, and he understands well the impact of this language. I joined him in supporting the removal of these misplaced conditions. Our nation's tribal law enforcement partners use these grants to address their most pressing needs. These programs support crowd--critical tribal law enforcement activities, such as conducting background checks on gun purchasers, registering and track--tracking sex offenders and combating drug trafficking and human smuggling. 
The conditions and unfunded mandates imposed by this bill will effectively halt the flow of these funds. Currently, one in every three Nate--Native American women, is a victim of sexual assault. And, the tribes of aggravated assault is roughly twice that of the rest of the country. Now is not the time to force restrictions on these funds. Native American families can't afford the consequences of these conditions. I support the efforts of the gentleman to restore these programs. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: If the there is no further debate, the member from Oklahoma is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
COLE: Thank you very much Madam Chair. And, to my--my good friend Chairman Serrano, I want to say you have consistently supported tribal causes in your entire career here. And, I appreciate that. On this one, we just simply disagree. We disagree because what is being done here frankly runs into the problem that all, one size fits all proposals, do. Not every Police Department is the same, not every jurisdiction is the same, and this is going to make it harder for tribal governments who deal with higher rates of crime to get the support and the help they need. 
Not easier. And, many of the problems it's designed to address, simply don't exist in tribal law enforcement communities. I think there's a strong case here to exempt these particular types of law enforcement agencies, from this particularly sweeping sort of, set of proposals, that are being put on all Police Department, every place in the country, regardless of their conditions or circumstances. So, I urge the passage of the amendment. Thank you, Madam Chair.

LOWEY: On this vote, the ayes are 22, the nays are 30, the amendment is not adopted. What purpose does the member from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart rise? 
DIAZ-BALART: Madam Thank you very much. I have an amendment on the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
DIAZ-BALART: I would ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, Madam Chairwoman. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. The member from Florida is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Last year, Chairman Serrano met with Max Schachter who tragically last--lost his son's life, his son lost his life at the Parkland School shooting. Max Schachter has turned his grief into advocacy. And, has been a champion in making our schools safer for our children, across the country. When he met with Chairman Serrano, Chairman Serrano not only showed great understanding and empathy, but Chairman Serrano acted forcefully. 
And, he put language and funding in the bill, which I'm very, very, grateful for. So, again, school hardening language, by the way, is also included in this year's bill and I mentioned that a little while ago. And, I'm very, very, grateful for that, as well. This carve-out that he did is usually important and we're talking about allocating $53 million for it. Let me take a moment to talk about why this language and this funding is needed. 
In the case of Parkland, the shooter didn't enter into the classroom but he instead, shot through the glass windows of the doors, killing a number of students, including, by the way, Max's son, Alex. If Stoneman Douglas's school had bullet-resistant glass on their doors, innocent lives, potentially even Alex's, may have not been lost. This language also calls for immediate notification system of the 911 emergency. 
Once again, with Parkland, it took over a minute for 911 calls to be transferred to the proper responding agency. And again, if immediate notification system had been in place law enforcement would have instantly known that there was a shooter, an active shooter. And again, and I'm grateful that the funding is in the bill. 
But, here's the problem. Here's the problem. Section 219 and I know that this was not the intention of Section 219, but as it currently stands, it prohibits state and local governments from accessing even these funds, unless they meet all eight police-related conditions, listed by the majority. 
And, failure to comply with any of those eight conditions, four of which requires state legislation, would prohibit our schools from accessing this necessary and lifesaving funding. Let me repeat that; failure to comply with all eight of those conditions, four which require actual legislative action, would prohibit our schools to receive this money to secure those schools, to harden the schools. I have to believe that's not--that is not the--the--the reasoning behind this. 
Again, it's--I think it's highly irresponsible to tie these restrictive restrictions to grants that are intended to keep our children in school, safe. And again, I have to believe that that is not the intention. Which is why I'm respectfully asking for all of you to join me in this amendment, that would simply just exclude, carve-out, this part, school safety issue, from Section 219. Again, it wouldn't apply to school hardening grants. Again, I'm sure, that that is not the intent. And, with that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Serrano, you are recognized. 
SERRANO: Thank you Madam Chair. I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. We must keep pressure on states and localities to improve their policing practices. The CJS bill contains a delicate balance of funding to address police misconduct, enforce civil rights, and promote racial justice. Some of these changes may seem harsh, but they meant to promote change. 
Exempting categories will undermine those efforts. And, that's why so many was voted for just these types of limitations, without exemptions, in the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. We must work to prevent gun violence in schools, by making a concerted effort to keep firearms out of the hands of the wrong individuals, or we cannot allow policing practices to continue as they are. And, our approach has being--has to be on the covers all segments of our society. I urge a no vote on this amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Aderholt. 
ADERHOLT: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. I strongly support the gentleman's amendment. The classroom is a space where every child, every student, deserves to feel safe, along with every teacher now, and staff, that is at that school. I believe it's inappropriate to condition a grant for a school hardening effort, on politics and policymaking, while communities grapple with the question of how best to mitigate the risk of mass violence in their schools. 
The led--the legislation before us, up-ends duly authorized programs with bipartisan support, like school violence perfection--prevention grants; by recklessly attaching unrelated, onerous, and unauthorized conditions. Like the gentleman, I oppose these provisions in this bill, which seek to derail the critical school safety efforts, in the name of policing reform. Striking these new controversial provisions is key to ensuring that schools continue to receive the assistance that they need. And so, I would urge a yes, on this amendment. And, I will yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Wasserman Schultz. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you Madam Chair. While my colleague Mr. Diaz-Balart and I, see eye to eye on the importance of protecting schools from targeted violence; I do rise in opposition to his amendment. And, that's because the underlying bill rightly places conditions on the receipt of federal law enforcement funding to address the nation's collective concerns over brutality and racism, a phenomenon that have been far too pervasive in policing. The conditions in the bill should be common sense and noncontroversial. 
It is long past time that police departments across the country ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, required de-escalation before using deadly force, and train officers on racial profiling and implicit bias. We should expect transparency and accountability from local law enforcement and demand such when these standards aren't being met. It is right to condition law enforcement federal grants, so that we may ensure that these standards are met. 
And, that includes funding for school hardening. Now, I'll point out the gentleman from--from Florida, my friend is not completely correct; the conditions do not apply to separate state and local stop school violence funding. They do apply to the COPS funding and there is school--there is school funding in the COPS portion of the funding, but not in the separate state and local funding. 
So, that's an important distinction. And, I take a back seat to no one, when it comes to working to prevent school violence. In 2018, miles up the road from my own home, at a high school in--in my home county, Marjory Stoneman Douglas lost 14 children and 3 school staff members, who were murdered, at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School chaos. My colleague Representative Diaz-Balart and I have worked with--with Max and worked well together for years, to fund the Stop School Violence Act and school hardening measures. 
And, we will continue to do that. But I cannot support this amendment. Everyone has a right to safety in school, at home, and in their community. And, we also cannot ignore that too often police presence in schools often leads to disproportionate discipline--disciplinary action towards students of color. And, that's why we need to make sure that there is accountability and that these funds are tied to making those important changes, so that, everyone; including the students who attend the schools, feels safe in school. 
We should be unequivocal in demanding changes to police practices that will ensure the safety of communities of color, who disproportionately face violence and harassment. And, I'll close by--by sharing a story with you. A number of years ago when I--I started with Congressman Hastings in our community, a law enforcement community task force, a young lady who was then the student body president at Dillard High School, talked to us at our opening round table. 
And, she explained to the leaders before her that in our side of town, meaning mine, where--where I and my family live, in my district, spans from the ocean to the Everglades in Broward County; congresswoman, congressman, on your side of town when there's danger and kids see the police, they run towards the police. Because the police are looked at as a safe haven. 
Congresswoman, congressman, on my side of town, when kids feels unsafe and see danger and they see the police, they run away from the police. Because that's the instinct, unfortunately, and the experience of too many children of color. So yes, we need to make important significant changes to end the reality of police brutality in the lives of too many communities, every single day. We don't have to sacrifice equity in policing and law enforcement, in order to protect our schools. We can and must do both. I urge a no vote on this amendment. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate the member from Florida is recognized on the amendment for one minute too close. 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you very much Madam Chairwoman. I respectfully could not disagree in stronger terms. Using the safety of our children in schools, to put pressure on police departments, I frankly--is something that I cannot agree with. It--one thing has nothing to do with another, this has nothing to do--the safety of our children in schools, have nothing to do with the issues of policing around the country. And, this is not theory; our schools have been proven to be targets. 
They've been proven to be targets. All this language does it says, let's just separate those two aspects, let's make sure that we do not put at risk the funds that Chairman Serrano and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and I and others, have fought so hard for. Let's not jeopardize them because of things that are unrelated. And, let's not use the safety of our children as pressure points, to get other things done. 
This should take priority. And, let's not use them as pawns to get other things done. There's an opportunity to very narrowly, very narrowly, and I do this with great respect, very narrowly just carve out this section of school safety school hardening; so that we do not put it at risk. And, I would ask for your favorable consideration--favorable consideration. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

LOWEY: The member from Florida is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you Madam Chair. This amendment will really combine the whole amendment the Diaz-Balart amendment and open up all of these programs, within the COPS grants, and give local law enforcement access to these funds, for school safety, tribal law enforcement, information sharing, and active shooter training. As this bill is currently written, law enforcement agencies and local and state legislatures would have to meet arduous requirements in order to qualify for these important grants. 
Grants that I heard people all over, support. While this bipartisan support for these police reform, this bill does not provide a pathway to achieve many of those ideas. Instead, it takes a heavy-handed approach outlining federal mandates that are a step towards nationalizing local and state law enforcement; not towards keeping our communities safer. The underlying provisions of this bill usurp funding from localities who do not or cannot, comply with a long list of partisan demands. 
Funding that helps keep our kids safe in school, funding that helps improve tribal law enforcement, funding that helps keep drugs out of our communities; all programs that everyone, I believe, in this room supports. But many of these programs affected by this provision have previously enjoyed, as I just said, wide bipartisan support. 
I've worked with many of my colleagues on this committee, on both sides of the aisle, to pass and implement the Stop School Violence Act of 2018. In fact, a bipartisan group of almost 100 members, 69 Democrats, 28 Republicans, sent a letter to this committee supporting the program. 
I would hate to see these programs, which have broad bipartisan support, go unutilized or underutilized, because of a long list of partisan demands. Let's make sure that our state and local law enforcement agencies have access to these important programs. And, I urge the adoption of this amendment. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Serrano is recognized. 
SERRANO: Thank you Madam Chair. I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The CJS funding bill addresses the urgent need the change in policing practices and accountability, by ensuring that federal funds are not used to support discriminatory and harmful behavior. Many of the provisions in this bill mirror HR 7120 which is voted and passed by this House, on June 25th, 2020, less than a month ago. 
Within this act for components that established limitations on eligibility for Byrne grant programs and COPS grant programs. The conditions placed on receiving Byrne JAG or COPS funding provide the guarantee that those who receive federal funding would adhere to the policing standards, as passed by the House, in the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. If you voted yes for the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, then I encourage you to vote no, on this amendment. I urge a no vote on this amendment. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Aderholt is recognized. 
ADERHOLT: Thank you Madam Chair. I support the gentlemen's amendment, by imposing new unauthorized conditions on Byrne JAG and COPS programs, the majority has chosen to halt funding for many authorized programs, with strong bipartisan support. One of these, in particular, is the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, which provides some crucial care for officers that have critical mental health issues, that may develop or reduce the rate of officer's death by suicide. 
The occupational fatality rate for law enforcement is three to five times greater than the national average for the working population. The officer who protects us must also protect against incapacitating mental and emotional health problems, as well as, against hazards of their job. I have heard directly from a law enforcement community, in the district, I represent, about the toll that law enforcement careers can have on an individual and the growing needs for resources like those that will be threatened by this. 
So, as I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, the underlying bill would jeopardize programs such as the regional information sharing activities, the anti-meth, and the anti-heroin task force, as well. So, with that, I would urge a yes on the gentleman, from Florida, amendment. And, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Madam Chair, I support the gentleman from Florida's amendment. As a former Sheriff himself, he knows firsthand the potential impact of the language. And, I agree with him that it should be stripped from the bill. It's shortsighted to condition state and local law enforcement assistance on activities far outside the control of our police and our sheriff's departments. 
One program that would be affected is the Police Act Grant Program that supports training to counteract act--to counteractive--suit--shooters, I'm sorry, to counteractive shooters and terrorist. This program enhances the ability of law enforcement to secure the scene. And, it also increases the chances that someone involved in one of these tragic events will be able to survive. 
In 2020 alone, this program will train at least 20,000 first responders. That's exactly the type of training that's needed to keep our community safe and professionalize the ranks of our law enforcement offers--officers. I find it really sad that we would be placing unreasonable conditions on assistance that could hold up funds, indefinitely. I urge support for the amendment, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, the member from Florida is recognized on the amendment-- 
CLERK: Ms. McCollum seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Ms. McCollum, you are recognized. 
MCCOLLUM: I'm the gentlewoman from St. Paul Minneapolis. And, I think we saw what hit the civil unrest when it hit the Twin Cities, Saint Paul, and Minneapolis. I would just like to go over again the nine conditions, oh and, I used to teach high school. So, I know what it's like to be in the lunchroom. And, I know what it's like when halls pass. And, I know when it's like when you're worried about students committing suicide, and they do the next morning. 
And, when weapons come into schools. So, I'm just going to go over the nine conditions that we're talking about here folks: the nine conditions, that they're objecting to. And, it's to improve police practices, eliminate racial profiling and implicit bias, eliminate excessive force and chokeholds, a chokehold is what killed the man that brought all the civil unrest forward. 
Eliminating no-knock warrants, in drug cases. We know recently of the case where a woman was shot and murdered in her own home, in a no-knock warrant, eliminating contractual arrangements that prevent investigations of law enforcement misconduct, eliminating sexual conduct between police and persons in their custody. Folks, I don't think that's asking for too much. I think that's common sense. So, I suggest a no vote on this amendment. 
LOWEY: If there's no further debate, the member from Florida is recognized on the amendment for one minute, to close. 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you, Madam Chair. I--I would point out that those requirements are for a law, not a policy. And, that is where I think there is--there's going to be tremendous challenges at the state and local level. One of the cornerstones of our democracy is our diversified law enforcement authorities who are accountable to the individual communities they serve. This bill begins to gut the concept of home rule and dangerously moves toward nationalization of state and local law enforcement; a move that threatens the very democracy we're all sworn to protect. 
And, I will close with a prediction, Madam Chair. And that is that, come next year the $343 million dollars that was placed into the COPS grant programs, so wisely, by Mr. Serrano, Chairman Serrano and--and Ranking Member Aderholt, we're going to--we're going to discover that most of that money is still going to be there. Mark my words, most of that money is still gonna be there. Because they will not be able to meet these arduous demands for laws, versus policy. With that, I yield back.

LOWEY: David? My colleagues, we made an executive decision but it's going to depend on your cooperation. We're going to move directly to T-HUD. 
(APPLAUSE) 
I know that many people have planes to catch tomorrow, etc., so if we can keep our comments brief, we're hoping we can finish this bill by 7:00. All in favor? Aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Good. I'm glad you agree with my executive decision. We are moving ahead. Okay, now we need--the chairman and I--the chairman and I made senior decisions and-- 
UNKNOWN: Come on. 
LOWEY: Our third order of business today is consideration of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriation Bill for Fiscal Year 2021. I will now recognize, Mr. Price, to present the bill. 
PRICE: Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman, I guess we can assume that everyone's now ready for the main event. 
(LAUGHTER) 
I'm proud to present the Fiscal 2021 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development related agencies appropriations bill. Before I mention a few of the bill's highlights, I want to once again thank our ranking member and former chairman of this subcommittee, Mario Diaz-Balart for his unfailing good humor and cooperation and collaboration. He's a pleasure to work with. 
I also want to thank Full Committee Chairwoman, Nita Lowey for her steady leadership, Ranking Member, Kay Granger, for her steady leadership and all the members of the committee from both sides of the aisle who contributed their ideas to help shape this bill. 
Finally, I want to recognize our excellent professional staff, our majority clerk, Joe Carlile, who's done a terrific job, always does. He also benefits from a great team; Gladys Barcena, Winnie Chang, Jo Eckert, Sarah Puro, Angela Ohm and Becky Salay. We're also lucky to have Doug Disrud, our minority clerk, his colleague, Alyssa Hinman. I also want to thank Sean Maxwell, from my personal staff, Chris Sweet, from Mr. Diaz's personal staff. We all appreciate the hard work that these people have done these past months under very unusual conditions. 
This year's T-HUD bill represents a renewed commitment to improve safety, produce more affordable housing, upgrade our aging transportation infrastructure and bolster our nations resiliency to a changing climate. At the same time, as COVID continues to sweep across the country, we ensure that valu--that vulnerable populations; homeless, youths, veterans, communities of color, domestic violence survivors, the elderly, the disabled, these vulnerable communities remain at the forefront of our efforts. 
The bill includes $75.9 billion in discretionary funding; an increase of $1.6 billion over fiscal 2020 and $16.7 above the president's budget request. We're grateful for receiving a healthy allocation and we're also grateful for more than $3 billion in offsetting receipts which all--all combined has allowed us to make real progress on our nation's housing and transportation infrastructure needs. 
Separately the bill also includes major increases in contract authority for formula programs that draw resources from the Highway Trust Fund rather than direct appropriations. That's an increase of $14.7 billion for highways, $5.8 billion for transit compared to last year's level. This is consistent with the INVEST in America Act which passed the House as part of H.R.2 on July 1. 
On the housing side of the ledger we provide increases of $100 million for CDBG, $350 million for home to help secure--to help spur community revitalization and the production of new affordable housing. We fully renew all housing choice vouchers to keep people stably housed. We provide $250 million for new vouchers targeted to homeless families and others at risk and we increase homeless assistance grants by approximately 23 percent over last year's level, the largest increase in over a decade. 
The bill also includes an 11 percent increase for the Public Housing Capital Fund and new set asides within that fund to address urgent health and safety issues. The bill also does right by transportation. All modes receive robust funding including highways, transit rail, aviation, backend pedestrian projects and ports. 
Amtrak receives more than $2 billion. The heavily oversubscribed BUILD program, formerly TIGER, receives $1 billion. The popular CRISI program for passenger and freight rail improvements is funded at $500 million; that's a very deliberate increase of more than 50 percent over last year. We provide sufficient resources for FDA's capital investment grants; otherwise known as New Starts, to ensure that all transit projects in the pipeline can move forward. And we provide nearly half a billion dollars for discretionary grants for buses, bus facilities and the Low/No Emission Program to allow transit agencies to recapitalize their aging fleets. 
We also renew our emphasis on safety activities at FAA, an imperative in the wake of the 737 MAX disasters and across DOT by providing targeted funding to boost certification and enforcement and to hire highly skilled personnel. Safety must always remain our top priority, particularly at FAA. 
There are more highlights, but I'll stop there. These investments will take us forward and our nation is facing an infrastructure crisis and that term isn't hyperbole. Under the leadership of Chairwoman Lowey, we've included an emergency title that provides for an additional $75 billion for infrastructure investments to revitalize our transportation networks, jumpstart affordable housing production and further reduce the disgraceful Public Housing Capital backlog. 
Some may object to the costs or think it inappropriate to designate this as emergency spending, but I would ask what's the cost of continuing inaction for our economy and for our communities? While members of both parties bemoan crumbling infrastructure, this legislation is an opportunity to prove that Congress, if not the administration, is actually serious about the issue, is willing to address the issue particularly as we contemplate the transition from pandemic to full recovery. 
Finally, I want to underscore that funding in this bill and the accompanying report promote equity and resiliency for all communities. We set aside funding for areas of persistent poverty, provide dedicated funding for DOT and HUD to offer more technical assistance to grantees that need it and boost funding for the programs that expand opportunity from housing counseling to workforce development to minority internship programs. 
The bill also seeks to pro--protect taxpayer dollars by incorporating resiliency principles into--into many DOT and HUD programs that help shape our communities, not just at the time of disasters. This means building smarter by--by requiring all hazards mitigation and the use of updating building codes. The bill also includes nearly $5 billion in dedicated funding to make water and energy efficiency improvements and ensure properties are more resilient in the face of natural disasters. 
So, in closing, the departments and the programs funded by the T-HUD bill are integral to our way of life. Housing and transportation connect us to jobs, services, education, yet everyday our constituents see the con--consequences of inadequate investments in our housing and transportation infrastructure. Natural disasters are increasing in severity and number, acerbated by accelerating climate change. Meanwhile COVID-19 is ravaging communities revealing a deepening existing disparities. This bill does it part to meet these challenges head on. 
So I want to, again, thank our Ranking Member, Mario Diaz-Balart, as well as colleagues, the committee--colleagues on the committee from both sides of the aisle and by the--by the way, we've been able to accommodate something like 90 percent of the member requests on this bill from both sides of the aisle. We--we've worked collaboratively and cooperatively; we look forward to continuing to this to enact this legislation into law. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize the subcommittee Ranking Member, Mr. Diaz-Balart. 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. I'm going to have to, I think, take this off for now. Thank you, Chairwoman Lowey, for presenting this bill but also I want to thank you, Madam Chairwoman for your leadership on this committee and, you know, the remarkable relationship that you and--and the ranking member have had in subcommittee and now in full committee. Your leadership is evident in--in this bill's investment in safety and in rail and in safety in housing, and safety--and in safety. Again, you have left a really deep mark with your service. And yesterday, Madam Chairwoman, you talked about how impressed you were with the members of the committee and the talent here but I would tell you, that a big part of that is your leadership and your demeanor and the fact that you are a class act. So, thank you, thank you, thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
I want to also--Mr. Price, Chairman Price, thanked the staff by name, both the majority and the minority staff. I just want to do--I'll mention a couple of people. Obviously, Shalonda and Emery who are probably the most sleep deprived people in Washington, D.C., and yet they always have this great wonderful spirit. And then you mentioned, Chris Sweet, of my staff, the chairman did. I want to mention, Cesar Gonzalez, my Chief of Staff. Sometimes I'm not sure if he works for me or for Kay Granger, but luckily he does remember, fortunately. 
Chairman Price has drafted a bill, to no surprise of mine, that thoroughly addresses the many transportation and housing needs of our nation. He has also, once again, gone out of his way, really gone out of his way, to include the vast majority of the requests from members of both sides of the aisle. 
Chairman Price is an honorable person who has been transparent, honorable, straightforward and a real privilege and pleasure to work with. I could not have a better partner. And once again, he has included policies, programs and oversight measures that will surely improve the way that agencies in this bill serve our constituents. I'd like to thank him for a number of things especially; he included $300 million for port infrastructure grants which is not just important to costal states like Florida but also to the entire nations freight network. The bill includes $389 million for the Maritime Academy Training Ship Program which will fully fund a training ship in Texas. He had to make some tough decisions to--to get that money and by fully funding the ship, the chairman chose the right policy for our Maritime Academies to bring this new training vessel into service without delay. 
I'm so pleased that the bill continues investments in our nation's highways, rail, transit, airport infrastructure. These programs will build on--on progress that this committee has made in the past; again, creating jobs and spurring innovation. Funding of the FA--of the FAA will move air traffic modernization programs forward, improve the safety and address noise concerns across the nation. The bill includes funding to renew housing assistance to all households currently served. 
Now, let me just mention why I meant--why this is important, we can't take this for granted what the chairman has done here. This year, these programs were--required about $2 billion in additional funding just to keep pace with the inflation and I'm grateful for the chairman for his commitment. It is our duty to meet this commitment especially for--for our elderly, for our disabled and for our heroes, the veterans. So, I--I also applaud the chairman for including innovative--and innovations to address homelessness in America including families at risk of becoming homeless, victims of domestic violence and veterans. So, again, the chairman has done, I think, a remarkable job. 
So, while I strongly support frankly most components of this bill, a fine bill that he has crafted in a very responsible way, I unfortunately at this time cannot en--support the entire bill before us, again, at this time. And let me tell you why. The bill includes, as we've all heard, $75 billion in emergency infrastructure spending. The spending is outside of last year's bipartisan budget agreement. This emergency funding in this bill and other bills put, frankly, our entire process, this hard work, at risk. The bill includes some controversial DOT and HUD policy riders. These were dropped last year but they were dropped consistent with a budget agreement and they should be dropped again so that we don't get stuck in unnecessary policy disputes. 
But despite these concerns, Mr. Chairman, Chairman Price, I want to thank you, once again, for making some really, really important tough policy decisions in this bill and also, again, for the way that you have treated the members of this committee, the members of Congress, myself in--in putting together this very responsible piece of legislation that we have today. 
I'm hoping that we can move forward and I'm sure that we'll be able to have a bipartisan agreement after this is all said and done, as we need to do, and with that, Madam Chair, Chairwoman, I yield back. 
LOWEY: I would now like to recognize myself for opening remarks. First of all, thank you, Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for your work on this bill. I also want to thank, again, the incredible staff. We'll mention all the names another time, but our staff is incredible on the appropriations committee. The Fiscal Year 2021 T-HUD bill represents a forward-looking vision to rebuild our nation and strengthen our communities; together we can revitalize our infrastructure, modernize our transportation system, protect the traveling public, expand access to safe, affordable housing and support our most vulnerable neighbors. The emergency funding in this bill is pivotal to kick-start a strong and equitable recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing economic collapse. 
After an unprecedented year of challenges, the investments in this bill lay the foundations for sustained economic growth and expanded opportunity for every American in every corner of our nation. This bill would fund safety upgrades on our roads and rails as well as research to improve safety technologies. It would increase funding for Amtrak by $50 million which is $1.1 billion above the president's paltry request. Increased funding for the Northeast Corridor grants by $50 million. Important to the New Yorkers I represent, this bill provides significant funding through the Gateway Project, one of the most important transportation initiatives in our country. Gateway will improve safety for millions and bolster the economy for the entire nation. 
In addition, the bill provides $26 billion in emergency funding to strengthen our nations aging infrastructure. Housing is fundamental to every aspect of our lives but the cost of living, especially housing, continues to place significant strain on our constituents including seniors, low income families, individuals with disabilities and veterans. COVID-19 has only compounded this reality. This bill would make life-changing investments for Americans including $3.5 billion for community development block grants which the president's budget requests sought to eliminate. It also increases tenant-based rental assistance, homeless assistant grants while blocking the Trump Administrations cruel policies that target mixed immigration status families and transgender people. It also provides $49 billion in emergency funding to mitigate the looming COVID-related housing crisis and ensure our neighbors have a safe and decent place to call home. 
I urge support of this bill. It would make dramatic improvements to our nation's infrastructure and in the day-to-day lives of the people we represent. I now would like to recognize ranking member Granger for her opening remarks. 
GRANGER: Thank you, I want to start by thanking Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for their hard work on this Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill. The programs funded in this bill reach into all of our communities creating more economic opportunity and improving the quality of life for the American people. 
This bill continues key transportation infrastructure and safety programs including highway, transit and port funding. The funding provided for airport infrastructure and air traffic modernization will be critical for the aviation industry as it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
I want to thank Chairman Price for working with Ranking Member Diaz-Balart to include many of the priorities of members on our side of the--of the aisle. Unfortunately, there are some provisions in this bill that will prevent me from supporting it. The bill is not consistent with the two-year budget deal that was signed into law just one year ago. This bill includes an additional $1.6 billion above Fiscal Year 2020 because a portion of the Military Construction and Veterans Affair bill has been declared an emergency simply to make room for more spending in this and other bills. 
The budget agreement last summer was built on an understanding that there would not be controversial policy riders. This bill violates the spirit of that agreement. Language is included that prevents The Department of Transportation from reallocating funds from the failed California High Speed Rail Project as well as language that would strip regulatory authorities from The Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Finally, this bill includes $75 billion in new emergency spending including components of the infrastructure bill that was pushed through the House without Republican involvement. I did not support that bill because it was a departure from years of bipartisan work on transportation and infrastructure priorities and I can't support this additional spending until there's a serious discussion with members on our side of the aisle. 
The best way to advance housing and transportation opportunities for all of our constituents and get funds distributed in a timely manner, is to work together. The programs in this bill are too important to be delayed by partisan politics. I hope we can address these problems as the bill moves through the appropriation process. Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Thank you. Are there any other members wishing to make short general comments about the bill? Ms. Kaptur is recognized. 
KAPTUR: Thank you. Madam Chair, I wish to congratulate Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for their hard work on this bill and as our nation faces down COVID-19, public health and economic crises, this infrastructure bill is critically needed to stimulate the economy, make investments in the future and put Americans back to work. 
The chairman's mark would do just that. I'm especially pleased that the bill includes $25 million for a pilot program to restore industrial and distressed communities that have been left behind. We know that feeling well in the industrial Midwest. They've never fully recovered from NAFTA's devastating effects or the 2008 Great Recession. 
These funds are critically needed, and we must ensure a much more robust program is included in the COVID-19 recovery legislation down the road. Additionally, this bill makes critical investments in several transportation programs that are the lifeblood of our economy, both in the regulator appropriations, in the $26 billion emergency infrastructure title. This bill provides record funding for the Saint Lawrence Seaway Administration Port Infrastructure Improvement Program as well as Amtrak. 
The chairman's mark rejects Amtrak's misguided attempts to limit long-distance service routes or to implement furloughs and layoffs. Now is not the time to deconstruct our nation's transportation infrastructure. The bill also provides $10 million in new funds to provide support of housing for intergenerational families. I have seen firsthand the effects of economic dislocation the opioid epidemic causes leaving many grandparents raising their grandchildren. These funds would help them a great deal. 
Further, I'm grateful for the inclusion of robust funding for Section 4, capacity building, we must think creatively to employ these funds to inspire the next generation of community development leaders across our country building on the experience we've already had. And finally, we will never realize a zero fatality transportation vision without addressing drunk driving head on. This committee is funding the development of leading edge technologies such as the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety which has the most immediate chance of reducing drunk driving and the associated deaths. We must continue to invest in existing technologies to stop drunk drivers while also vetting emerging technologies. 
Again, I thank the chair and ranking member for these important investments and yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Womack is recommend--recognized. 
(LAUGHTER) 
WOMACK: Thank you, Madam Chair. Look, I take my time this morning, or this afternoon, to express some disappointment of something not in the bill that has been in previous bills and I'm talking specific--specifically about the livestock haulers electronic logging device exemption. It's common sense. It's been in the bill for three years. Been supported by both sides of the aisle. Anybody that has a connection to livestock haulers should surely understand that they have two issues going on simultaneously, looking out for the safety of the motoring public but also the care and wellbeing of a precious cargo. 
Current ELD regulations provide very little flexibility for those hauling live animals. It can result in sickness and death especially in the hot weather. Most of our country lacks the infrastructure to load and unload livestock along major roadways forcing livestock haulers to adhere to a one-size-fits-all ELD regulatory environment. 
And then let's think about the coronavirus. You don't have to sit in this room behind a mask to understand the hardship that COVID-19 has had; just ask a livestock hauler. The supply chain, the food supply chain, the protein supply chain in our country has been hardshipped by coronavirus and we're going to add to the misery by not giving an exemption for the hauling of livestock. 
Sometimes I just shake my head. What are we thinking? I'd be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee or the ranking member but, Madam Chair, I--I just can't believe that under these conditions, even under normal conditions, that we wouldn't have an exemption for the people hauling the protein that we're going to feed on. And I yield back my time. 
LOWEY: Ms. Roybal-Allard is recognized. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD: Thank you, Madam Chair. I--I'd like to begin by commending Chairman Price and the staff for putting together a great T-HUD appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2021. And I would like to thank him for including language in the report to address the issue of fuel dumping by commercial airlines. In January of this year, a low flying airline on emergency approach to LAX dumped 85,000 pounds of jet fuel over my district including over several elementary schools where children were playing outside as well as in neighboring communities. This event was extremely traumatic for the children and families it impacted. Because the jet fuel was dumped at low altitude, the fuel did not properly disperse into the atmosphere as is typical when airlines don't fuel to make an emergency landing. 
As a result, children in my district were doused with jet fuel and several individuals had to be medically evaluated. Responding to this emergency, I discovered that the FAA does not keep track of when and where fuel dumps happen. The report language in this bill will require FAA to report to Congress data on fuel dumps that happened between 2015 through 2020 and the process FAA uses to review fuel dumps. This will provide Congress with the information needed to evaluate current practices and, if necessary, make any adjustments to protect our neighborhoods. This language will also help my community and the surrounding neighborhoods and Americans throughout the country know that Congress takes these experiences seriously and that we are actively working to prevent this kind of traumatic event from happening again in any community. 
I, again, thank the chair and I yield back the balance of my time. 
LOWEY: Mr. Kilmer is recognized. 
KILMER: Thank you, Madam Chair, and let me thank the chair, ranking member and the staff for the work on this bill. Even before COVID-19, too many folks in my district and across the country have really struggled to keep up with the cost of housing. I'm grateful that this bill makes investments to help communities like Bremerton and Tacoma and countless others that I represent, make progress towards meeting the demand for affordable housing. This bill provides critical investments in the Public Housing Capital Fund which will help public housing agencies like those in Tacoma and Kitsap and Port Angeles that are working to develop finance and modernize public housing. 
It provides support for programs to help local non-profits and community organizations deliver direct financial assistance to help folks make the leap to homeownership. This bill will improve lives. The bill also invests in the diverse transportation needs of regions like mine from promoting transit oriented development to funding our nations ferry systems and providing an additional $10 million for low and no emission ferry grants which have helped electrify one of the most heavily used routes in Kitsap County. 
This bill makes smart investments that will create jobs, reduce the climate impacts of our nation's transportation system. That includes critical funding for capital investment grants to support mass transit agencies that are facing unprecedented financial challenges from COVID-19. Finally, I'm proud this bill recognizes the important role that regional airports play in serving the emergency preparedness needs of rural communities. 
As a representative of a region that is especially vulnerable to natural disasters, I know how critical regional airports are to our emergency preparedness and disaster response. I am grateful that this bill reflects my commitment to ensuring that airports like Fairchild in Port Angeles can continue to maintain the critical infrastructure they need to fulfill disaster preparedness needs. 
I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mrs. Watson Coleman is recognized. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for your work in bringing this excellent bill together. It takes critical steps toward finally addressing our nations crumbling infrastructure while we are currently battling the coronavirus pandemic. It is important that we look forward to how we can rebuild the economy and this bills investment in infrastructure are important to us doing that. 
In particular, I'm pleased to see a total of $5.7 billion for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor including funds that could be used for the Gateway Program where much work is needed to be done. This bill will go a long way in addressing those needs. Additionally, this bill represents a historic investment--in investing our nations homelessness crisis. By increasing homeless assistance grants to $3.4 billion, we can provide necessary help to state and local governments as they work to provide permanent housing shelter for these families. 
Additionally, the over $27 billion in total for the Public Housing Capital Fund will help ensure residents of public housing can live in safe and well maintained homes and by investing over $19 billion in the HOME Investment Partnership Program, communities can work to expand affordable housing opportunities for low income families. 
Before I close, I want to thank the chair for working with me to include language to assure that HUD acts quickly to reimburse public housing authorities the thousands of dollars in overdue reimbursements for having units that have converted under their Rental Assistance Demonstration Program. I thank you again, Mr. Price, and Mr. Diaz-Balart. I support this and I urge that all of my colleagues do, and I yield back. Thank you. 
LOWEY: And Ms. DeLauro is recognized. 
DELAURO: Thank you, Madam Chair, and let me thank a--a--Chairman David Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for their work on this bill and I want to just say to Chairman Price, we thank you for your unwavering commitment to our nation's infrastructure crisis; affordable housing, disaster recovery, continued support for these programs during the pandemic; and a dear friend, steadfast leader for the Fourth District of North Carolina and all Americans across the country who rely on these programs. 
I want to say thank you to the chair and ranking member for providing $78.7 billion for Surface Transportation Programs consistent with the INVEST Act; $750 million for the Northeast Corridor grants and the inclusion of funding for studies in two areas we have worked together on for many years. The first is a qualitative study of how publicly available data on rental property health and safety violations impact landlord and renter behavior. People should be able to know if the apartment they are thinking about renting has past issues that could put them and their families' health and safety at risk. 
The second is a feasibility study to explore how to collect different local policies related to evictions and a statistical effort relating to the creation of an evictions database including how information is collected, consistent with Civil Rights protections to understand eviction trends by classes protected under the Fair Housing Act. We have taken necessary steps in the CARES Act to freeze evictions for federally subsidized housing or in property backed by government loans. The HEROES Act passed in the House included a critical new 12-month moratorium on non-payment evictions from stan--substantially all rental housing given that we could be facing a wave of evictions across the country if the HEROES Act is not enacted. We have no way to track evictions which would provide critical data for policymaking like deciding where resources should be spent. 
Tracking evictions was an issue prior to the pandemic and the need is even more great as the result of COVID-19. These two critical studies at HUD will inform our policymaking to pursue how we can best track evictions and how publicly available rental property health and safety violation--violations information allows renters to make the right decisions for themselves and their families. I strongly support this T-HUD appropriations bill and, again, thank the chairman and the ranking member for their dedication to making transportation and housing safer and invest in our infrastructure and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mr. Cole is recognized. 
COLE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank both our chairman and our ranking member for working so well together no matter which one of them happens to be chairman and which one of them happens to be ranking member. It's been one of the most effective partnerships in the committee. And I--but I particularly want to thank our chairman for not retiring this year so these opening remarks can be a lot shorter. I yield back. 
(LAUGHTER) 
LOWEY: Mr.-- 
(LAUGHTER) 
Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Cuellar? 
CUELLAR: Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to thank Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for the bipartisan work that they've done on this particular bill. I want to mention just a couple of things; one, thank you so much for the Highway-Rail Grade Crossing to make sure that we don't block the streets and I want to thank you for that infrastructure money. I also want to say thank you for the money for housing, whether it's the homeless or the--the housing assistance and--and of course the monies that you provided to the airports also. 
Finally, I want to mention one particular item to close and that is the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel, the $345 million for the National Security Mult--Multi-Mission Vessel Program. Again, this is something that could be a sign so they can go ahead and train merchant Marine cadets and I want to say, thank you so much. And with that, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LOWEY: Mrs. Bustos is recognized. 
BUSTOS: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Bal--Balart for your hard work on this bill and I want to thank the staff as well. This bill makes critical investments in our nation's transportation and housing infrastructure. However, I'd like to specially thank the committee for including one particular program. The bill provides $55 million for the Federal Aviation Administration to replace air traffic control towers; more than doubling the enacted amount in Fiscal Year 2020. 
Air traffic control towers provide essential services to the U.S. National Airspace System by coordinating the movement of both passenger and freight flights safely and efficiently. However, despite the critical importance these towers serve, the average age of towers across our nation is 33 years; with the oldest towers reaching 65 years. 
In my district, we have two towers in desperate need of replacement. The Chicago Rockford International Airport operates one of the oldest air traffic control towers in the country; built in 1958 before the Federal Aviation Administration was even founded. The tower is too short to allow controllers to adequately see the end of the runway and they continue to face the issues that come with any aging structure such as losing heat during the Midwest winter. 
That's not the kind of environment we should be asking air traffic controllers to work in and at the Peoria International Airport in my district, the air traffic control tower is one of the worst buildings I have ever visited during my time in Congress. From a roof that leaks into asbestos-filled ceilings to a basement that floods significantly in almost any storm. This airport is long overdue for a new tower. 
This funding will help address the backlog of air traffic control tower needs; an important step in ensuring that our air traffic controllers are given the tools to provide for the safe movement of people and goods across our air space. I thank the committee for including it and I yield back. 
LOWEY: And, Ms. Clark, is recognized. 
CLARK: Thank you, Madam Chair. I am grateful for this great bill by a great chairman who has a great relationship with a great ranking member and great staff to back it up. These are much needed investments. I'm particularly grateful for the domestic violence piece that you included that will help survivors prevent homelessness and help prevent seniors back home in Massachusetts from being evicted in this pandemic and for all the climate resiliency pieces that you added. Thank you, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Mrs. Torres is recognized. 
TORRES: Thank you, Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart. I appreciate your leadership and your staff support throughout the process as we crafted this bill before us today. We are meeting to discuss transportation at a time when so many streets are empty and so many flights are grounded. We're discussing housing and urban development at a time when a global pandemic has upended decades of incremental progress in communities across the Inland Empire where I live and countless others across this country just like it. Everyone is struggling right now. 
Some will get through these times better than others which is why I am grateful for the much needed focus on homelessness in this bill. It includes a $250 million increase for programs to reduce unshel--unsheltered (PH) homelessness and nearly $25 billion to reduce the public housing maintenance backlog; enough to have the backlog for just one year. 
I'm also pleased that my colleagues incorporated so many of the provisions that I called for in this legislation; Transit-Oriented Development Policies and a pilot program that helps state and local governments make smart infrastructure investments to increase affordable housing near public transportation. 
Twelve million to fund a regional infrastructure accelerator which helps local governments develop strategic plans and maximize their limited resources; blocking the administrations callous public housing rule, change targeting undocumented immigrants that threatens the housing of 55,000 American children. This bill is a $76 billion investment in American progress at a time when so much in our society has grounded to a halt. 
These funds will help ensure people in my community don't have to face the perils of coronavirus without the security of a place to call home. This bill makes the infrastructure investments we need in order to one day un--unshutter (PH) our economy again. 
And I am proud to support it and I am proud to have worked on it under the superb leadership of our Chairwoman Lowey. And before I end, let me say, that I am truly grateful for the opportunity to serve under your leadership as appropriations committee chairwoman and the SFOSs (SP) chair, especially as we review such an important bill to my district. 
The committee will miss your leadership and your legislative legacy is an inspiration to all of us and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Well, thank you. It doesn't appear that there are any other members wishing to make--oh, Mrs. Lawrence, you are going to be the last member and we eagerly await your comments. 
LAWRENCE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm so excited. I wanted to just be on the public record as the co-chair of the Bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth I have fought tooth and nail to prioritize the mental health of children who are entering the foster care system and I'm so grateful that the chairman and the committee included language that acknowledges the mental anguish suffered by foster youth and strongly recommends that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provide enhanced funding for a collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services to identify and support programs that could promote mental health screening for foster youth. It goes further to note that they're understanding that mental health screening should occur within 30 days of a child entering the foster care system just as we do physical health screenings. We all know that if a child is in foster care, they have--they have experienced a trauma in their life. 
Thank you so much. This is what we should be doing, and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Are there any other members wishing to make general comments about the bill? Seeing no other member wishing to make opening remarks, I would be delighted to recognize Chairman Price to offer a manager's amendment. 
PRICE: Madam Chair, thank you, I do indeed have a manager's amendment at the desk. 
LOWEY: And the clerk will read the amendment. 
PRICE: And I ask for the reading to be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Mr. Price is recognized. 
PRICE: This amendment is--has--has technical corrections to--to the bill. Some non-controversial report language as well to clarify the intent of a few parts of the bill. We've worked with, my friend, Mr. Diaz-Balart and accommodated many requests for both sides of the aisle. So, we're confident in asking colleagues to support this amendment. I yield back. 
LOWEY: And Ranking Member Diaz-Balart is recognized. 
DIAZ-BALART: Madam Chairwoman, great amendment, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Are there any other members who wish to be heard on the amendment? I recognize, Mr. Price for one minute to close--Mr. Chairman Price, for one minute to close. 
PRICE: Thank you, Madam Chair, we ask our colleagues for support. 
LOWEY: And the question is on the amendment. All those in favor say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Those opposed say no. In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. Are there any further amendments? 
For what purpose does the member from Florida rise? 
RUTHERFORD: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
RUTHERFORD: I want to ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. And the member from Florida is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you, Madam Chair, this amendment strikes Section 193 which prevents the DOT from reallocating funds from the failed California highway Speed Rail Project. Last year the DOT cancelled this grant agreement for the simple reason that the California High-Speed Rail Authority failed to comply with the terms of the agreement and costs escalated from $33 billion to over $100 billion or almost $100 billion. An additional service--initial service was going to be delayed from 2022 to as late as 2029. 
Even Governor Newsom faced reality and threw in the towel on the project, scrapping the original 380 mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles because he said the project would cost too much and take too long and only committed to trying to complete a smaller segment from Bakersfield to Merced and after cancelling the grant agreement, DOT deobli-de-obligated $929 million in unused funds. This funding could, and I believe should, be made available for other rail infrastructure projects at any of our districts including other worthy projects in California. 
Instead they--the majority is forcing DOT to lock these funds away if there is any litigation whatsoever on the project and my amendment would simply free up these funds for worth infrastructure projects that are on time, on budget and that create jobs and opportunity and I would urge a yes vote and I yield back. 
LOWEY: Chairman Price is recognized. 
PRICE: Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. My colleague is addressing the merits of the California High-Speed Rail Project. That isn't the question before us today. What--what is before us is the question of whether the project should or shouldn't be built in the midst of this litigation and in the midst of an agreement to--to--to work it--work it out through the legal system. 
The--the question about whether it shouldn't or shouldn't be built isn't--isn't before us. The section of the bill that this amendment aims to strike simply upholds an agreement that the Department of Transportation and the State of California have already reached. In May 2019 both parties agreed to essentially freeze the Fiscal Year 2010 High-Speed Rail Funding for California until a decision is reached in federal court on DOT's decision to deobligate funding for the project. That amendment, that agreement, has been upheld by DOT for over a year and so Section 193 merely holds DOT to that agreement. 
Meanwhile, the question of DOT was right or wrong to terminate the grant agreement and deobligate the funding, we can debate that all we want but that isn't what we're deciding today. It will have its day in court. And the existing language ensure that it has its day in court; that we respect the legal process. So, I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Diaz-Balart? 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, my--I actually strongly support this amendment and I want to thank, Mr. Rutherford, for bringing it up. I don't think we should limit the ability of agencies to reallocate funds from projects that have proven to, frankly, just fail to deliver. They failed to deliver on their grant agreements and, again, as--as Mr. Rutherford said, this--this actual amendment would free-up nearly a billion dollars from a project that has not lived up to its expectations and has just not delivered on the original agreement. 
I think it's a common sense amendment. I thank the gentlemen for bringing it up and I would support it. With that, I yield back. 
LOWEY: Ms. Granger is recognized. 
GRANGER: Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. I also support the amendment. It's really unfortunate the majority included a rider that locks away funds The Department of Transportation recovered from the failed California High-Speed Rail Project. 
Those funds should be made available for other infrastructure projects that de--deserve our support by striking this rider, Mr. Rutherford's amendment pro--improves this bill by freeing up funds for other needs. I thank the gentlemen for offering the amendment and I urge a yes vote. 
LOWEY: If there is no-- 
CALVERT: Madam Chairman. Madam Chairman? Way over here? 
CLERK: Mr. Calvert seeks recognition. 
LOWEY: Mr. Calvert is recognized. 
(LAUGHTER) 
CALVERT: Thank you, Madam Chairman. And I--being from California I just couldn't help myself. Been--I obviously support this amendment. This rail project is the biggest boondoggle in the history of boondoggles. 
(LAUGHTER) 
And for God sakes, let's be merciful and put a fork in it and pass this amendment. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Thank you. 
LOWEY: Okay. If there is no further debate--the member from Florida-- Okay, is there any--the member from Florida is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
RUTHERFORD: Thank you, Madam Chair, and--and I'll be very quick and just say that, you know, I don't think we should reward failure and if programs are not executed as promised the agencies under our jurisdiction should recover those funds and allocate them where they are needed currently. 
This is common sense stewardship of our taxpayers hard earned dollars and I urge a yes vote and I yield back. 
LOWEY: The question is on the amendment offered by the member from Florida. All those in favor say, aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Those opposed say, no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
LOWEY: In the opinion of the chair, the no's have it and the amendment is not adopted. Ready? Okay. For what purpose does the member from North Carolina rise? 
PRICE: Madam Chair, I have an amendment to the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
PRICE: And I ask that the reading be dispensed with. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. The member from North Carolina is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
PRICE: Madam Chair, I--I would hope we would agree, this is a highly appropriate amendment given the conditions under which we've marked up these bills. It has to do with requiring passengers onboard airplanes, Amtrak trains and certain public transit vehicles to wear face masks for the duration of the presidentially declared COVID national emergency. 
The health risks of COVID-19 remain dire as cases skyrocket in many states. Scientists and public health experts agree that one of the simplest things we can do, and the most important thing to stop the virus is to wear a mask. In fact, over these months, the evidence and the advice have only become stronger as to how important the simple ask--the simple act of wearing a mask can be. 
My amendment mandates that until this pandemic is over, commercial airlines, Amtrak, the large transit agencies require passengers and employers, employees, to wea--wear a facemask while onboard a plane, train, subway or bus. Ensuring that we protect each other isn't just the right thing to do, it also provides confidence to the public when it comes to travel; whether it's a quick trip to the store across town or a longer journey across the country. 
Many of us have experienced what it's like to travel from our district to--to Washington by plane. We've experienced first-hand the uneven safety protocols of air travel in the time of COVID. Some airlines have blocked middle seats, others haven't. It's nearly impossible to social distance on an aircraft and many other modes of public transportation and while many airlines and many transit agencies and Amtrak have required passengers to wear masks, these policies are not universal, their enforcement is uneven and we're not just talking about members of Congress or business travelers, we're talking about everyone who travels; healthcare workers, caregivers, grocery store employees, retail workers, so many other essential people rely on trains and buses and transit to get to and from work each day. 
Telework isn't an option for these frontline heroes. So just as we're wearing masks in this hearing room, at the grocery store and in public, everyone can and should wear a mask while on a plane, train or a bus. It's a matter of common sense and it's a basic consideration of each other. My amendment adds a proven measure of safety to travel and provides a modicum of reassurance to the traveling public and the dedicated workers from flight attendants to bus operators who keep our transportation networks running. The language is familiar to us by virtue of its inclusion in the HEROES Act. So, I ask you to support my common sense amendment. 
LOWEY: Ms. Wasserman Schultz? 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you, Madam Chair. I rise in support of the Price amendment which would require something that should have already been required, the use of masks on maj--major forms of mass transit such as airlines and Amtrak. As our country, and my own home state of Florida face record breaking numbers of cases of COVID-19 day after day, we can no longer rely on good faith alone to see us through this pandemic. As a nation we all have to get more serious about a simple and proven tool that has helped flatten the curve in countries around the world. 
Masks must be required on mass transit. The future and wellbeing of our country depends on it. This is common sense during a pandemic. 
In a few weeks, we--we have communities across this country that are facing children returning to school. The--the more people that are circulating through our communities and our economy, the more critical it is that we are wearing masks that protect one another from one another. It is absolutely essential. 
But many Americans do not understand the scientific evidence behind masks. Or worse, they view the adoption of this basic safety measure as undermining their freedom somehow or as an affront to their political beliefs. My right and your right to live without fear of being exposed to a deadly virus by my neighbor is an important right that needs acknowledgment, the right to stay healthy, and to not have someone else infect you because of their impudence. 
In a time of unprecedented fear and confusion and upheaval to our daily lives, the adage knowledge is power has never been more relevant. That's why I'm introducing the How Awareness and Prevention Protects You Act of 2020, the HAPPY Act, a bill that would create a national evidence-based education campaign through the CDC to improve public understanding of the tools and methods to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. 
As communities proceed through the various phases of reopening, understanding how to protect ourselves and each other from the continuing spread of COVID-19 is critical. People are dying. People are becoming infected. And in--and in many cases, they're becoming infected because of other's refusal to wear a mask or sadly, their own refusal to wear a mask. 
The science is clear. The more of us that wear facemasks, the more lives that are saved. That's just simplicity, scientific simplicity. As members of a civilized society is it our--it is our shared responsibility to keep one another safe. We must think of our neighbors and our colleagues and wear a mask. We cannot meet this virus alone, unguarded. 
It is the right thing to do, and it also has the benefit of getting the economy back on track more quickly. I know that's something that we can all unite behind. And I strongly support the amendment. And I yield back. 
LOWEY: The hour is late, and I'm going to close this session, but I can't resist associating myself with the comments of the chairman and the gentlewoman from Florida as I see pictures of people attending mass events in many states around the country without masks, without social distancing, and they wonder why the numbers in the United States of America are going up and up and up. So, I thank the chairman for your comments, and I thank the chair--well, my friend from Florida for your comments. 
(LAUGHTER) 
And I do hope wisdom prevails. And I want to thank all the members who've been here today appropriate--someone else is saying? 
UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) Oh, I don't have my mask. 
LOWEY: Who? 
UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) Yeah, I just want to-- 
LOWEY: Okay, I'll finish my sentence, and then I gather Dr. Harris. I would just like to thank all the members for your cooperation. Wearing the masks, we're socially distant, and I think we've accomplished a great deal in these outstanding sessions. So, I want to thank all the chairs and all the members who are participating. 
And Dr. Harris, was it you who--I--I'm sorry I didn't see you. 
HARRIS: Yeah, I just seek recognition. 
LOWEY: Oh, recognition. You are recognized. 
HARRIS: Thank you very much. And I just want to ask the--make--offer the amendment a couple of questions, clarifying it. So, it--it says mask or protective face covering, and that's different from CDC guidance right now, which just says face masks. So, I'd just like to ask to offer the amendment, what is the other protective face covering? Is that a bandana? Is that a face shield? 
LOWEY: (OFF-MIC) Oh, come on. 
HARRIS: Why is it--the language different from the CDC language? 
PRICE: The language isn't deliberately different from the CDC language. As far as I'm concerned, a face covering is another name for a mask. This is a language that was in the HEROES Act and was worked out with a number of--with--with extensive consultations. As that got put together, I can't say that we--we paid particular attention to it. It doesn't seem there's anything objectionable, isn't it? We're talking about a face covering, and a--and--and--and--and a mask that--that inhibits-- 
HARRIS: Well-- 
PRICE: Inhibits--inhibits the spread of--of what everyone spreads when one coughs or sneezes or talks. 
HARRIS: Sure. And--and no, there's a reason I ask. Because, you know, the June 9th edition of the journal of the American Medical Association, there's an article that discusses, for instance, whether face shields are actually better than face masks. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Would the gentleman yield? 
HARRIS: So--I certainly will. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Just for the improvement of the discussion to inform the gentleman. I'm reading from CDC.gov. CDC recommends that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings and when around people who don't live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. It goes on to say cloth face coverings may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the vice--a virus to others. 
Cloth face coverings are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings. Cloth face coverings should not be worn by children under the age of two, so they repeatedly referred to it as cloth face coverings in their guidelines. 
I yield back. 
HARRIS: Right. Okay, and I--I reclaim my time. The specific CDC guidance on airplanes, though, just says facemasks. Now, there's a reason I--I ask this and--and where I'm getting to is that you--in other places in this amendment, you say or in accordance with CDC guidelines, but you don't say it in this part. And the reason I ask is because if this becomes--if this is part of the law, then we would--if the CDC, for instance, says that, you know, face shields are in fact as--as--as the evolution of protection using face coverings of some sort occurs, the CDC could say that, in fact, face shields are preferable to face masks, but we would be saying unless this language is permissive, that's why I ask. 
For instance, are face shields considered a protective face covering? So, I guess my question is, is that true? And secondly, why--why not say or CDC--or following CDC guidance sense CDC guidance changes over time with the evolution of scientific knowledge? It just sounds like we are--we're saying as Congress this is what it is for this emergency, even if the CDC figures out something else and changes guidance at some point in time. So-- 
PRICE: I think--I think-- 
HARRIS: (INAUDIBLE) off, to questions. Are face shields included? And secondly, why not say, according to CDC guidance or as a--as a--as recommended by the CDC? 
PRICE: I think it's pretty evident from the language that, yes, we intend to--to include face shields. That's--that's why the--the language is as covers--says what it does and--and is as expansive as it is. 
I also would--would hope and expect that just as it's become clear over the last three months, that probably the most important single thing we can do is wear masks. I don't think that was fully appreciated three months ago. Just--just as this evolves and as the CDC learns more and issues further guidance, I would hope that the people implementing the--the legislation would--would be responsive to that. 
I--I believe our language is generic and expansive enough to permit that. 
HARRIS: Thank you very much. And I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate, the member from North Carolina is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
PRICE: Thank you, Madam Chair. The amendment ensures uniformed standards for face coverings, worker protections, and basic sanitation procedures in accordance with CDC guidelines. And it will--it does, and it will mirror basic scientific understanding. This is about common decency. It's about protecting each other. 
It will help restore confidence for travelers. It will help as we get the economy moving. It will provide the industry with certainty about what their responsibilities are under the law. Everyone involved here, all the stakeholders here should value the specificity and the certainty of this so that nothing's left to--to chance and that we--we protect each other. So, I urge adoption of the amendment. 
LOWEY: The question is on the amendment offered by the member from North Carolina, all those in favor say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
LOWEY: Those opposed say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
LOWEY: In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the amendment is adopted. 
For what purpose does the member from New Jersey rise? 
WATSON COLEMAN: Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. 
LOWEY: The clerk will read the amendment. 
WATSON COLEMAN: And I ask unanimous consent that the clerk dispenses with the reading of the amendment. 
LOWEY: Without objection, the reading of the amendment is dispensed with. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. 
LOWEY: The member from New Jersey is recognized for five minutes on the amendment. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm offering this important amendment to fix technical issues with the CDBG Disaster Relief Funding for Survivors of Hurricane Sandy. Nearly eight years ago, Sandy caused billions of dollars in damage to New Jersey as it ravaged the East Coast. Unfortunately, for complex reasons, many people who were not eligible for disaster relief funds were mistakenly awarded money. Now, eight years later, many families are on the hook for large sums that they did not expect to repay. 
My amendment would allow the secretary of HUD to waive recoupment of disaster relief funds under certain conditions, one, if the recipient is now deceased, or two, if the recipient has been defrauded, filed for bankruptcy, or gone through foreclosure after receiving funds. It would also protect individuals from having to return funds when they received assistance from multiple programs. This duplication of benefits problems has been a major issue in many disasters, and this language is similar to what the House has endorsed for other disasters on a bipartisan basis. 
As the only member on this Committee from the great state of New Jersey, I am proud to offer this commonsense amendment to provide a pathway for relief to as many constituents from our state who have shared with our delegation heart-wrenching stories. Take, for example, John, who was a senior on a fixed income. He and his wife had to cash out retirement funds to compete--to complete their new home. Since his passing, he left behind recoupment to his wife and estate. 
It is well-intentioned folks like these who would benefit from this amendment. It makes no sense to recapture funds that were awarded to an individual who is now deceased. And further, it does not benefit the public interest for HUD to attempt to recapture funds from individuals experiencing extreme hardship like bank--bankruptcy or foreclosure. And that is why I encourage my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment. 
LOWEY: I recognize Mr.--Chairman price for one minute to close. 
PRICE: No, no, Madam Chair, I rise in support of Ms. Watson Colman's amendment, if I may. This is--this is an amendment that I--I'll take just a moment to explain. Ms. Watson Coleman has--has lined out the circumstances under which you would apply very, very well. 
I want--I want to appreciate--I appreciate very much her work on this, along with her colleagues from New Jersey, Mr. Kim, Mr. Pallone, others have--have cooperated in putting together what turned out to be a fairly complicated process, but in the end, we have a good solution here, and I'm confident in--in recommending it. It does appear technical and complex, but it really boils down to fairness for individuals hit by disasters. 
Many of us have had disasters in our own states, a flood, tornado, hurricane devastates a community. Many funding streams are and can be used, SBA, FEMA, HUD. They assist individuals harmed by disasters. Each program has its own rules and requirements. Sometimes people apply for and receive funding from multiple programs without realizing they might be breaking the rules. 
Sometimes there's a recapture, a so-called recapture where a grantee is--some of the money is--is taken back and used for other purposes, other recovery purposes. But sometimes pursuing a--recapture puts a disaster survivor in a completely untenable position. That's the point. 
Months or years after the disaster struck, they may face the prospect of losing their home or their business by virtue of having money clawed back. So, re-victimizing these individuals is not in anybody's interest. And that's what we're dealing with in this amendment with respect to particularly the--the Sandy disaster. 
This amendment would implement an approach where grantees, in consultation with HUD, can seek relief in cases where it makes sense. They still provide safeguards against fraud and abuse. It doesn't increase costs. These are funds that have already been appropriated. 
So, it's--it's, I think, a good solution, an equitable solution that will offer relief to--to people whom as I say, we--we don't want to re-victimize. And I should also stress that it's similar to a provision included in H.R. 3702, passed the House with bipartisan support under suspension of the rules last November. It simply applies this--that--that principle to additional beneficiaries. 
So, I want to thank Ms. Watson Coleman for her work on the issue and urge support of the amendment. 
LOWEY: Mr. Diaz-Balart. 
DIAZ-BALART: Thank you, Chairman-- Madam Chairwoman. I--I also want to thank the congresswoman, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, from bringing up this issue. You know, this is similar to issues that--that Congressman Frankel and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and I have worked on in the past, issues that--that come up after storms. And--and Chairman Price and I have been dealing with these--this kind of issue, for now, a number of years, and so the chairman mentioned the bill that passed the House, which is something that we have to continue to push because it's essential, and so I look forward to working with him and with Congresswoman Watson Coleman on those issues. But again, I think this is--a good amendment under the circumstances, and I would urge the adoption. I yield back. 
LOWEY: If there is no further debate. The member from New Jersey is recognized on the amendment for one minute to close. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to stress that this is commonsense ethics, and I hope that my colleagues will vote yes and help provide much-needed relief. Thank you. I yield back.

[*]LOFGREN: I have a gavel and the Committee on House Administration will come to order. I want to acknowledge the members who are with us today and welcome my colleagues here in California. And good afternoon for those of you out east. 
I want to remind our members and participants of a few things that will help us navigate this virtual hearing. We're holding this hearing in compliance with the regulations for remote committee proceedings pursuant to House Resolution 965. Generally the committee will keep microphones muted to limit background noise. Members will need to unmute themselves when seeking recognition for their five minutes. 
Witnesses will need to unmute themselves when recognized for their five minutes or when answering a question. Members and witnesses, please keep your camera on at all times even if you need to step away for a moment during the proceedings. Do not leave the meeting. 
As we begin, we should take a moment to honor an important anniversary in our nation's history. 57 years ago today, hundreds of thousands of Americans came to our nation's capital for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Our beloved colleague and hero, the late Representative John Lewis spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial that day. He fearlessly challenged our country's denial of freedom and civil rights to black Americans including the right to vote, a right that the Supreme Court more than 70 years earlier called preservative of all rights. 
Today many people are gathering at the Lincoln Memorial to commemorate the March and commit--and continue demands for voting rights, racial equality, police accountability, and criminal justice reform. Free and fair elections and unencumbered access to voting are the bedrock of our democracy. And yet today during a global pandemic the likes of which our country has not experienced in more than a century, voters are worried about how to safely vote and how to navigate potential disruptions this November. 
Nearly half of Americans expect difficulties voting this fall according to recent polling by the Pew Research Center. Doesn't have to be that way. No one should be forced to choose between their right to vote or their health. In June, Chairperson Fudge convened an important subcommittee hearing to examine the impact of COVID-19 on voting rights and election administration. Tragically, since that hearing an additional 3.6 million people have been--have become infected in the United States and another 59,000 Americans have lost their lives to the disease. 
This crisis has devastated many families and disrupted our way of life. The virus will continue to affect how we live for the foreseeable future, including how we vote. I look forward to hearing more today from our experts about how people can vote safely during this pandemic. Americans have cast ballots during great strife and national emergencies before. Civil War soldiers voted by mail from the battle fields. Millions of men and women in uniform have voted by mail since then, including after Congress passed the 1942 Soldier Voting Act and the Federal Voting Assistance Act in 1955. 
References to civilian mail voting date back to the late 1800s. This year many states have changed their election procedures to make voting safer from a public-health perspective. Although some voters in all 50 states can vote from home, the widest availability is for voters in 44 states and the District of Columbia who live in a no excuse vote-by-mail state or where fear of COVID counts as a valid excuse this fall. 
Other Americans can choose to vote early in-person in one of 42 states that provide it. Early in-person voting helps keep polling places less crowded. Or vot--voters can go to polling places on election day itself. Offering various methods of voting is consistent with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends quote ""alternative voting methods that minimize direct contact and regruc--and reduce crowd size at polling locations"". 
Voters should have the option to vote by mail or to vote in-person, and it should be safe and accessible. The House passed reforms to make this possible 105 days ago in the HEROES Act, including $3.6 billion in funding (INAUDIBLE) ease nationwide implementation. Unfortunately, Leader McConnell has refused to take up the legislation, choosing instead to delay and do nothing for months. 
The virus however has not delayed nor has it simply disappeared. And sadly, neither has the president's disinformation campaign against voting, especially absentee voting. The president's assault has now exten--expanded to include even the United States Postal Service, a venerated and popular institutions enshrined in our Constitution. 
Earlier this month, President Trump as he's prone to do said the quiet part out loud. He explicitly stated he opposes funding the Postal Service because the Postal Service facilitates voting by mail. Meanwhile the Trump-appointed Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, enacted disruptive operational policies that have caused days-long back logs in mail delivery across the country. Policies that impeded mail service to senior citizens, veterans, and the sick who depend on postal service to deliver medications and other essentials including ballots. 
I heard from thousands of my own constituents whose mail had been delayed. They were outraged. After much public outcry, Postmaster General DeJoy announced some of the policy changes would be paused until after the election. This reckless management of the Postal Service warrants close scrutiny and continued accountability. 
The House did its part on Saturday, passing the Delivering for America Act on a bipartisan basis to prohibit the Postal Service from implementing any further changes that will delay mail and reduce delivery standards. The bill would also require the Postal Service to treat all election mail as first class mail, as has been its practice for years. And it will provide the $25 billion in much needed funding that its Board of Governors--each Governor appointed by President Trump himself--has requested. 
Still, the president continues to spread disinformation and falsehoods about the safety and security of voting. They do not bear repeating at a congressional hearing. What does bear repeating is the best way voters can stand up to bullies at the ballot box. 
Make a plan to vote. Register to vote or confirm your registration and update it if necessary. Do that as soon as possible. Visit vote dot gov for more information. Decide if you plan to vote in-person or by mail.. Research your options, follow those instructions carefully, including if you need to request a ballot. And request and cast your ballot early if you can. And if you are healthy and able, consider signing up to work as a poll volunteer by going to help America vote dot gov. 
Many jurisdictions scrambled at the last minute to find poll workers this spring and summer. You can do your part by considering this public service. Now I look forward to the testimony today but I want to recognize first the ranking member, Mr. D--Davis for any opening statements he may wish to make. And I understand he wishes also to show a video of less than two minutes as part of his o--opening statement. 
So Mr. Davis, you are now recognized. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you Madam Chair and thank you for recognizing our colleague John Lewis and the--the difference he made to our nation not so long ago. I want to do something a little different today and start off my testimony as you mentioned by playing a video that was brought to my attention a couple days ago and that I was so haunted by the rhetoric that I can't unsee and I can't unhear it. 
Because it's this kind of unnecessary over the top rhetoric that lead to me and my Republican colleagues getting shot at on a baseball field just over three years ago. It's actually a video by a Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, whose chair is a witness today at this hearing. Here's the video. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
UNKNOWN: America is undergoing an awakening. Battling a killer that has haunted our nation since before its founding. But white supremacy does not endure on its own. It is propped up by suppressing black voices and votes, from the three-fifths compromise to Jim Crow to voter ID. 
White supremacy isn't just a toxic ideology, it's a strategy to hold power. Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever. 
(APPLAUSE) 
So it's no surprise that Donald Trump clings to that strategy so desperately in 2020. Very fine people on both sides. That's why Democratic Secretaries of State will fight to ensure every eligible American can vote safely and legally this November, expanding vote by mail so that no one has to choose between their vote and their health. White supremacy has no place in our elections and no place in our country. Together, we can demand an America that is truly equal. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Actually, white supremacy doesn't have any place in our nation. But it's over the top rhetoric like that that has lead to many, many situations that I'm afraid I don't want to see happen to anyone in this country. 
Recent analysis by NPR found that nearly half a million mail-in ballots were rejected in the 2020 primaries. The same analysis noted studies also show that voters of color and young voters are more likely than others to have their ballots not count. In California alone, 102,000 ballots were rejected. 84,000 in New York. 23,000 in Wisconsin. These are Democrat states. In the last four elections more than 28 million mail-in ballots went missing according to the EAC. Yet Democrats on this committee, in this House, and across the country continue to push implementing universal vote by mail before the November election just over 60 days away. 
Additionally, during the 2020 primaries we saw the closure of polling places across the country force people to wait hours in line to vote. Washington, D.C. closed more than 120 polling places. In Atlanta, voters waited upwards of five hours to vote because of consolidated polling locations. Milwaukee went from 180 to five polling places. In Philadelphia, 77 percent of the polling locations were closed. In Houston voters reported waiting close to six hours to vote. 
All of these cities are run by Democrats. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 fought against discrimination to ensure every American could cast their vote. I'm afraid the vote-by-mail policies being pushed by Democrats are unintentionally taking us backwards. I've sent oversight letters to localities where we see these issues during their recent primaries because I'm concerned that unless changes are made, voters will be disenfranchised again this fall. 
Again, most of these are Democrat-controlled areas. I'm very concerned about fraud when a live ballot is mailed to every registered voter in states where their voter roles are not up to date. I want integrity in our election process. Not because I want to suppress votes, but because I want every vote--every vote to count. I want the American people to have the confidence that we all have in our election process. 
This doesn't make Republicans or anyone else who shares these concerns racists or white supremacists. And I'm incredibly disappointed that the ad I played earlier insinuates that. As I said at the beginning of my testimony, this is the kind of rhetoric that has lead to violence that I personally witnesses and even violence last night in Washington, D.C.. No one--no one should stand for that. 
Instead, let's discuss our differences and find common ground to empower states and localities to help everyone safely and securely vote this fall. With that, Madam Chair, I'll yield back the balance of my time. 
LOFGREN: (INAUDIBLE) this is--we have a distinguished group of witnesses. And I will introduce them in turn. First we have Secretary Alex Padilla who is the California Secretary of State. He is focused on modernizing the office, increasing voter registration and participation, and strengthening voting rights. In 2018 he launched the California Motor Voter program which automatically registers eligible Californians to vote when they obtain or renew their state ID or drivers license. 
The program registered one million new voters in its first year alone. In March 2019 California reached a record high 20 million registered voters. He also oversaw the 2018 election in which 64.5 percent of registered voters cast a ballot, the highest turnout for a gubernatorial election since 1992. He sponsored legislation in 2015 to establish vote centers, expand early voting, and implement same day conditional voter registration through the Voters Choice Act. 
Previously he served two terms in the California State Senate and represented the east--east San Fernando Valley on the Los Angeles City Council. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley, attended local schools, graduated from the Massutes--Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in mechanical engineering. And I remember when he was elected head of LULAC he said he only did--had time for two things betrum--besides being in the State Senate and being a husband and a father and that was being chair of the MIT Alumni Association. So welcome to you. 
We also have Julie Wise who is the Director of Elections for King County Washington since November of 2015. King County is the thirteenth largest county in the nation and has approximately 1.3 million registered voters. She has served King County for more than 15 years including prior to her election as the Deputy Director of Elections, managing day to day operations of elections. A Washington State certified election administrator and nationally certified election registration administrator, Ms. Wise has been recognized at both the state and national level for her contributions to moving elections forward. 
Ms. Wise has pursued significant reforms and innovative solutions to remove barriers and increase access--access while ensuring accuracy, security, and transparency. She has added two languages, allowing voters to access election services in five overall: English, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese. In 2018 she worked with the King County Council on Executive to prevail in providing pre-paid postage for all registered votees--voters in the county. And we welcome you. 
We also have Ms. Amber McReynolds. She is the CEO for the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition, the co-author of When Women Vote, and the former Director of Elections for the city and county of Denver, Colorado. She is an experienced election professional and is nationally recognized as an innovator and has proven that designing pro-voter policies, voter centric processes, and implementing technical innovations will improve the voting experience. 
With her leadership, Denver elections earned national and international recognition from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Election Center, and National Association of Counties and the International Center for Parliamentary Studies. For Ballot Trace, a first in the nation ballot tracking reporting and communication engine and eSign, a digital petition circulation application that makes ballot access process more efficient. 
She was recognized in 2018 as the top public official of the year by governing magazine for her transformational work to improve the voting experience in Denver and across Colorado, and recently she was recognized as one of the top 25 most powerful women in business in Colorado. She serves on the advisory board for the MIT Election Data and Science Lab and on other boards and organizations. She has a Masters of Science from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. 
We also like to rec--recognize--Amber thank you so much for being here. Ms. Vanita Gupta who is president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. She's been working to advance civil rights her entire career. Before joining the Leadership Conference in June of 2017, Ms. Gupta served as Acting Assistant Attorney General and Head of the U--U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division. 
Appointed in October 2014 by President Barack Obama as a chief civil rights prosecutor for the United States, she oversaw a wide range of criminal and civil enforcement efforts to ensure equal justice and protect equal opportunity for all during one of the most consequential periods for the division. Under her leadership, the division did critical work in a number of areas including advancing constitutional policing and criminal justice reform, prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking, promoting disability rights, protecting the rights of LGBTQ individuals, ensuring voting rights for all, and combatting discrimination in education, housing, employment, lending, and religious exercise. 
Prior to joining the Justice Department Ms. Gupta served as Deputy Legal Director and Director of the Center for Justice at the American Civil Liberties Union. She joined the ACLU in 2006 as a staff attorney. She began her legal career at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. She graduated Magna Cum Laude from Yale University and received her law degree from the New York University School of Law where she later taught civil rights litigation at their clinic for seven years. And we welcome you. 
And finally but not least, Commissioner Don--Donald Palmer was confirmed to the EAC in 2019. He is a former Bipartisan Policy Center Fellow where he provided testimony to state legislatures on election administration and voting reforms concerning election modernization. Commissioner Palmer was appointed Secretary of the Virginia Board of Elections by former Virginia Governor Bob McDonald in 2011 and served as the Commonwealth's chief election officer until 2014. 
He formerly served as the Florida Department of State's Director of Elections. Prior to his work in election administration, he served as a trial attorney with the voting rights section of the Department of Justice's civil rights division. He was a U.S. Navy intelligence officer and Judge Advocate General, and he was awarded the Navy Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Joint Service Commendation Medal. And we welcome you Commissioner and all of the witnesses. 
And I would remind the witnesses that your full statements will be submitted to the record and we would like you to address us for about five minutes, summarizing your testimony and then we will go to members for questioning. 
So first we will turn to you, Secretary Padilla. Thank you so much for being here with us. 
PADILLA: Sure. Well thank you, Chairman Lofgren, Ranking Member Davis, and members of the committee for the opportunity to address you today. 
I want to talk about the two greatest threats to a free, fair, and safe election this November: the COVID-19 pandemic and election disinformation. California held its primary on March third of this year and our first COVID-19 emergency declaration was issued the very next day. We soon began to hear from local officials that many of the polling places and poll workers that we were depending on for the November election were backing out. 
And as we listened to federal and state health officials, it quickly became clear that we would need to modify how we administer the general election if we were to keep the election accessible, secure, and safe. But California voters will not have to choose between exercising their right to vote and protecting their health. So we are expanding vote by mail while working to maintain safe in-person voting options for voters who need it. 
California's well positioned. Vote by mail has grown from 25 percent of ballots cast about 20 years ago to 72 percent in this year's primary. So my office convened stakeholders to identify potential challenges and to develop solutions. Our recommended plan, adopted by the Governor and our state legislature includes the following. 
County elections officials will send every active registered voter a vote-by-mail ballot. We're expanding our ballot tracking tools statewide, where voters can sign up to receive notifications by email, by test message, or phone call on the status of their ballot through the postal service both on its way to the voter and on its way back to the county. Including a final alert when their ballot has been received and when the ballot has been counted. 
More than 600,000 California voters have already signed up. We're extending our postmark plus three policy to postmark plus 17 and we set alternative minimum in-person voting requirements for counties that are struggling to maintain the pre-pandemic number of in-person voting locations. So counties may consolidate polling places to one location for every 10,000 registered voters but these--but they must be open for a minimum of four days leading up to and including election day. 
These counties must also provide a minimum of one ballot drop off location for every 15,000 registered voters starting 28 days before election day. And of course we're working with public health officials to craft the health and safety guidelines for in-person voting locations. 
Now these measures require resources. Thanks to the recent HAVA and CARES Act appropriations and significant state appropriations, California's in okay position. But other states can't say the same. Many states have not received state funding and many states that have held their primary elections during this pandemic have expended most if not all of their CARES Act's funds. So I respectfully urge you to appropriate more funding for elections as soon as possible. 
The other threat I mentioned is election disinformation. Baseless attacks on the integrity of our elections pose a serious danger to the health of our citizens and our democracy. Disinformation amplified and often initiated by President Trump about vote by mail, ballot drop boxes, and more undermine public confidence. 
Numerous reports and court decisions have found that voter fraud is rare and isolated. To quote U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson of Kansas, ""The rare known cases of voter fraud were not the tip of the iceberg. There is no iceberg, only an icicle largely created by confusion and administrative error."" And earlier this week the FBI said they have no information or intelligence that any nation state threat actor is engaging in activity to undermine any part of the mail-in vote or ballots. 
I also have to say I'm deeply concerned about the Postal Service. The ability of the USPS to effectively handle the surge of vote by mail would rely on a close collaboration with state and local election officials, the approval of overtime and expansion of their workforce, and expanding mail sorting capacity and the number of mailboxes. California's prepared, but we do not control the Postal Service. We need your help to ensure a healthy USPS. 
Together, these threats pose unprecedented dangers to elections officials and to voters. To protect our democracy, state and local elections officials must act now. California provides a template but we need Congress to provide the resources to ensure an accessible, secure, and safe election. Thank you. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much Mr.--Secretary Padilla. And now I'd like to ask Ms. Wise if you would (INAUDIBLE) your testimony for five minutes. 
WISE: Good morning, Chairwoman Lofgren, Ranking Member Davis, and members of the committee. Thank you for the invitation to testify before you today. My name is Julie Wise and I'm the Director of Elections for King County, Washington. King County is made up of 39 cities, ranging from Seattle to suburbs, small towns, and rural communities like where I live on a farm at the base of Mount Rainier. 
We are home to the most diverse zip code in the country as well as multi-billion dollar tech companies, farmers, artists, and small businesses. Most importantly from my perspective, we are home to 1.4 million registered voters who care deeply about their community. I've been working elections for 20 years. I've overseen polling places, the transition to all mail, and now manage elections for the one of the largest vote-by-mail counties in the country. 
I'd like to start this morning by addressing some misinformation about vote by mail that's been circulating of late. First, voting by mail is secure. Before we moved to vote by mail, we managed 8,000 poll workers across as many as 700 polling locations. Now we process every single ballot at one location, our secure headquarters. Not only does this limit risk, it means I can directly oversee the entire operation. 
It means we can track and reconcile every ballot and it means the public and observers have complete transparency. All of our election staff are highly trained paid employees who swear to uphold the sanctity of the election. 
Second, voter fraud is almost non-existent. While we've seen lots of claims often fueled by speculation and little evidence, the reality is that we have many safeguards to prevent fraud. We ensure accurate voter rolls by working with other states at the Department of Licensing, USPS, and the Social Security Administration. 
In King County and Washington State, cases of suspected fraud are incredibly low. In 2016 King County elections referred 17 cases of potential voter fraud to our prosecuting attorney. And that's out of a million ballots cast compared across 30 states. For a rate of just 100,000th of a percent. 
Third, the United States Postal Service is essential to democracy. And I've found recent reports of removing mailboxes and lagging delivery times incredibly troubling. What I can tell you about our experience in Washington is that we benefit from a decade old relationship with our Postal Service partners whom we meet with regularly, and daily during an election. 
The good news is that in our August primary election we saw normal delivery times for both our outgoing and inbound ballots. However, let me be clear. I view any threat to the Postal Service as an attack on our community's right to vote. I will be closely monitoring changes and continuing to meet with USPS to make sure we stay in front of any issues ahead of November. 
I also know there's been speculation that ballot drop boxes aren't secure. Constructed of half-inch thick steel and weighing in over a thousand pounds I can assure you that our 70 plus boxes are safe. We even had one hit by a school bus, and I can attest that the box and its contents were just fine. The school bus, not so much. 
Over half of our voters use a drop box to refern--return their ballot. They are emptied daily during the voting period by trained staff in teams of two complete with a comprehensive set of security procedures. 
Finally, vote by mail removes barriers. I believe that my job is not only to conduct accurate elections but also to remove barriers to voting. From creating a first in the nation partnership to provide training and grants for voter education to adding service in new languages to partnering with the Seattle Seahawks, we've found new ways to engage voters and we've seen the results. 
King County reached 76 percent turnout in the 2018 midterm election and nearly 60 this print--this year for our primaries. In fact, this fall we're projecting a 90 percent turnout. Of course we live in a different world now than we did just six months ago, and I'm doing a number of things to make sure we are ready for the upcoming presidential election in light of COVID-19. I want to underscore how critical the grant dollars were that we received through the CARES Act. 
While King County may be well positioned to handle an election during the pandemic, there has been a lot to do to make sure that our voters and staff are safe. We have set up drive through vote centers, installed partitions and plexiglass, and implemented temperature checks. CARES dollars have ensured that our voters can make their voice heard safely and our staff don't have to risk their lives to help make democracy happen. 
Over the last several months my office has gotten inquiries from across the country about how to do vote by mail. The reality is that every jurisdiction already does some form of vote by mail. That's what absentee voting is. The challenge for these dist--jurisdictions is how to expand their ability to handle a whole lot more mail ballots. First they need resources to expand their existing operations and to communicate with their voters. 
Beyond that my main piece of advice is that we all need to reste--start resetting expectations about results on election night. We're not gonna know final results and that's okay. To process ballots accurately takes time. We need to make sure jurisdictions have the time and space without having the election's validity questioned. Thank you again for inviting me here today. 
LOFGREN: Thank you ve--very, very much. We now will hear from Ms. McReynolds for about five minutes. You need to unmute. 
MCREYNOLDS: Good morning, Chairwoman Lofgren and Ranking Member Davis and the--the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. First I--I want to say congratulations to my dad really quickly. He was just sworn into a higher court in Illinois a few days ago and we couldn't be there. So if he's watching, congrats dad. 
As mentioned, my experience not only is now currently running an organization that is supporting election officials across the country but formerly I was an elections (INAUDIBLE) and oversaw election processes for 13 years. And I'm also an unaffiliated elector which I will always like to highlight in terms of--of my political affiliation. 
The pandemic has upended all aspects of our lives and the voting process is no different. Simply put, our democracy is essential and we must do everything we can to be sure that our election system is ready, resilient, and secure. Election officials are working each and every day to make this happen even in extremely challenging circumstances and often with one hand tied behind their backs to do outdated laws and a lack of funding resources. 
What is clear to me during this pandemic and all the challenges we have faced as a nation is that Americans are resilient and they deserve a voting process that is also resilient not only from a pandemic or--but from unfairness, barriers, burdens, from foreign adversaries, and from administrative deficiencies due to outdate policies that create long lines. 
Voting by mail is proven to be resilient dur--both during natural disasters and also now during the pandemic. Expanding vote at home options is non-partisan and supported by leaders on both sides of the aisle. 
I want to address a few key concerns that have come up recently. As noted in a CISA report released on July thirty-first and I quote, ""Disinformation risk to mail-in voting infrastructure processes is similar to that of in-person voting while utilizing different content. Threat actors may leverage limited understanding regarding mail-in voting to mislead and confuse the public."" 
Now this report is critical at highlighting not only about--an issue within the security of our elections but particularly as it relates to vote by mail. And this includes casting doubt without evidence about the mail ballot process. Thus combatting disinformation and misinformation is a critical aspect of election officials work right now. 
The Postal Service operations are critical for our election processes regardless of voting method. Mail ballots are actually just one piece of how the Postal Service supports the election infrastructure. Federal and state laws have legal mandates with regards to sending voter registration information, ballot issue notices, election information, poll worker appointment letters, polling place notification cards, and other required mailings. 
All of these are legally required and are at risk if the Postal Service is unable to process mail effectively or experiences delays. And this is especially--when it--when during the critical time period around election day. Some states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Maryland, and Minnesota have also not updated certain election laws and processes to ensure adequate time to process mail ballots. Which has caused recent delays with election results. 
Local election officials and state officials have repeatedly highlighted this gap and some state policy makers have refused to make the necessary adjustments even though they are simply operational, not partisan. States still have time to close those gaps and support election officials with their work. 
Let me be clear. Election results have never been final on election night. There are specific post-election processes including receiving and counting military ballots, processing provisional ballots, auditing the voting system, and canvassing the election results that happen and then certification occurs. Additionally many western voters are still casting ballots when the media starts to call winners in eastern states. This has been a problem for decades and it is not new this year. 
As with every part of our election system we must be able to deter, detect, and hold bad actors accountable that try to interfere with the voting process. While voter fraud is exceedingly rare in elections regardless of method, it is still critical for election officials to detect malicious activity and for voters to report suspicious activity to appropriate authorities. 
Our democracy functions when every eligible voter is able to exercise their right to vote. No system is perfect and this is why it is critical to continually review and improve systems by enhancing security access and transparency. An example of a necessary improvement is ballot tracking systems, or risk limiting audits. Democracy is the shared DNA of our communities and throughout our history. 
Election administration and policy must be about who votes and not who wins. And we must put voters first. Just like the Postal Service, election administration is a service and must be far from partisan politics. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much. We'll now turn to Ms. Gupta. And you are recognized for about five minutes. 
GUPTA: Thank you Chairwoman Lofgren, Ranking Member Davis, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today for safe, fair, and accessible elections during the COVID-19 crisis. The first for American democracy requires a new urgency as the nation grapples with a confluence of crises, from a global pandemic to a looming economic recession that's hitting communities of color hardest to widespread outrage about state violence against black people. 
Taken together these crises really expose how deeply racial inequality continues to permeate American life. We need strong democratic institutions and voting options free from unnecessary encumbrances now more than ever. The leadership conference has been profoundly troubled by the recent operational changes within the U.S. Postal Service. Americans depend on the U.S. Postal Service for timely, affordable access to medication and daily necessities. 
It's also an essential service for voting amid a pandemic. Voters should not be forced to choose between their health and their fundamental right to vote. And sabotaging the U.S. Postal Service could do just that. Our nation has a long and troubling history of denying people of color the right to vote. Even as we commemorate the lar--March on Washington and celebrate the hundredth anniversary of women's suffrage, we remember that African American women and women of color were not able to exercise the franchise for decades after the ratification of the nineteenth amendment. 
And while the Voting Rights Act of 1965 offered new tools to fight blatant forms of discrimination, people of color have continued to face barriers to voting. Especially after five justices on the Supreme Court invalidated the VRA's key enforcement provision in 2013. Despite the best efforts of the leadership conference coalition to protect voting rights for vulnerable communities, voter suppression continues today to take its toll. 
What we have seen in this year's primary elections alone providers a dire warning of what we could expect in November without congressional action. From undelivered absentee ballots to unreasonably long lines to polling place closures to undertrained staff to disinformation campaigns that are specifically targeting voters of color. 
That's why lawmakers must act now to ensure that the general election is fair, safe, and accessible and support state and local election officials that are trying to do just this. First it means taking immediate action to preserve the integrity of the Postal Service. The USPS is legally required to deliver mail to all postal addresses no matter how far it may have to travel or how profitable the work. The accessibility and affordability the USPS provides is crucial to seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and rural and tribal communities. 
In response to the alarming problems at the USPS and disinformation efforts to undermine voters' confidence in voting by mail from officials in the highest offices of the land, a bipartisan House majority passed Delivery for America Act last weekend. This bill needs to be made into law. It would provide the USPS with a $25 billion in emergency funding and restore services. And we are really encouraged by this important step to protect the U.S. Postal Service. 
However, our concerns on the upcoming election go well beyond the U.S. Postal Service. We are just over two months away from the general--2020 general election and states need funding to prevent a repeat of the disasters during the primaries this spring and summer. Congress must allocate the $3.6 billion that was in the HEROES Act now for states to fully prepare for November and provide voters with a range of options to safely cast their ballot. 
The leadership conference is pushing in states as well to expand online and same day voter registration, to ensure access to no excuse absentee ballots with pre-paid postage, prohibit the requiring of notarization of witness signatures to cast an absentee ballot, automatically mail absentee ballots to all registered voters no later than two weeks before election day, require the counting of ballots postmarked on or before election day, and have widely available secure drop boxes. 
They must expand ear--in-person early voting and ensure that voters residing on Indian lands can vote by maintaining safe in-person voting option and provide secure ballot return drop boxes. And lastly, there's a huge urge--urgency to provide funds to states to be able to educate voters about all of the rules changes and combat disinformation. We are also encouraging voters to make sure they understand how to take direct action themselves by making sure they're registered, making a plan to vote early, and to sign up to be a poll worker. 
For the past 70 years the leadership conference coalition has fought to open the doors to our democracy. And for the next 70 days we're gonna do everything that we can in our power to push Congress to safeguard the right to vote in the critical November election. Thank you. 
LOFGREN: Thank you so very much for your testimony. And now we will turn to Commissioner Palmer. You are recognized for about five minutes. 
PALMER: Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairperson Lofgren, Ranking Member Davis, and members of the community. I appreciate the testimony--the opportunity to testify today on the election assistance commission's ongoing work to support election officials and the voters they serve. 
Election officials are working tirelessly to ensure that elections are safe, accessible, secure, and accurate. I would like to thank Congress for funding to the states in response to the pandemic and to assist in the security of elections. The agency has distributed almost $1.2 billion in grant funding since 2018 including $400 million in recent CARES Act funds. These revenue sources have proven vital in preparing for November. 
While funding of the commission and its mission remains below its historic budget levels, we were able to pivot and prioritize our response to COVID by bolstering existing programs and developing new services. The EAC held a series of virtual forums of lessons learned, discussing ways to improve election procedures for the benefit of voters. We hosted 20--over 25 forums with officials and experts to hear what went right and what went wrong. 
We (INAUDIBLE) absentee mail voting adjustments, in-person polling place safety, and assistance for voters with disabilities. Americans should feel confident that in-person voting locations will be safe for voting. We worked closely with the Centers for Disease Control to revise guidelines to ensure in-person voting is a safe option for voters. And of course CARES Act funds have been used to purchase PPE for election workers and sanitize polling places. 
As we sit here today about 60 days prior to election day, the train is preparing to leave the station. The 45 day deadline for the sending of overseas and military ballots is September nineteenth, only three weeks from now. The men and women who serve as election administrators across the country are engaged in a Herculean effort overcating--overcoming the challenges of our dem--pandemic in addressing the concerns and needs of the American people. 
They deserve much credit and respect (INAUDIBLE) they are processing millions of voter registrations, recruiting and training poll workers, preparing ballots, testing the voting equipment, and focused singularly on making this election a success for Americans. 
The EAC appropriately stays prepared for the anticipated increase in the use of absentee or mail ballots. States are using CARES Act grants to fund additional materials, postage, and personnel associated with this shift. Some are using this funding to implement online portals to request absentee ballots and make the process for requesting mail ballots a more efficient and secure process. 
During the primary season there were a number of ballots rejected due to a lack of signatures or that arrived past deadlines. In a recent EAC roundtable, a Postal Service representative recommended that voters requested their absentee ballots no later than 15 days prior to election day and return no later than seven days prior to election day. 
In my opinion voters should start the process even earlier: 20 to 30 days prior to election or ballot return deadlines. Voter education at the state and local level is essential to reduce the chances of error, omission or delay, and return or counting of the ballot. One critical item for in-person voting is to ensure-- 
(AUDIO GAP) 
LOFGREN: I think we have a glitch with Commissioner Palmer's Wi-Fi perhaps. Is there-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --Madam Chair, while we're waiting for him to come back and finish his statement, can I raise a point of personal privilege real quick and get it--get an answer? 
LOFGREN: Sure. 
RODNEY DAVIS: We had one of our members have to back out today late notice. (INAUDIBLE) Will I get a chance to do a second round for the (INAUDIBLE)-- 
LOFGREN: --Yes, I'm planning to do a second round of--of questions. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Commissioner's back. 
LOFGREN: Ope--Mr. Palmer I think your Wi-Fi is going on and off. 
PALMER: (INAUDIBLE) deadlines issues have arisen in jurisdictions that use post marks to ensure ballots received after election day were mailed on time. As more states have begun providing prepaid envelopes to voters there have been problems with the uniform application of post marks for this type of mail. In New York and Wisconsin local officials took the time to reach out to postal officials to ensure ballots would be postmarked, but thousands of ballots slipped through. 
The Postal Service has stated its policy is to postmark domestic election mail even when prepaid. A clear directive from the Postal Service that ensure every ballot sent as election mail receives a clear, legible postmark would support uniformity and help avoid any confusion or controversy. I would encourage city and county governing bodies to give election administrators whatever emergency support may be necessary to meet all deadlines and ensure administrators that they have the support necessary to secure polling places and poll workers. 
The (INAUDIBLE) administrators on behalf of voters not only here in the U.S. but for our overseas and military voters are crucial to our democracy. We look forward to our continued work together to support election officials and the voters they represent. Thank you. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much Commissioner. And now we have a time when each member of the committee may question the witnesses for five minutes. And I'd like to turn to the ranking member first to begin with the questions. Mr. Davis, you are recognized for five minutes. You need to unmute. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Yep. Not like we haven't been on this rodeo before. I apologize. I do have some questions for Ms. Wise. If you could, Ms. Wise just--I--first off thanks for being here. I--I appreciated your opening statement. And Ms. McReynolds, go Illini. Tell your dad I hope never to see him in the court room in Henry County but congratulations. But I--I want to ask Ms. Wise. Many are pushing for your counterparts in other states to jump head first into all mail elections even at this late date. 
I'm really concerned any sort of switch at this point on the calendar's gonna cause some election administration issues. So I'm gonna give you a series of questions. Can I just get a yes or no answer? Cause I don't have a lot of time and I'm the only one on our side. 
Was the reason King County delayed its move to all mail elections because it needed time to procure the necessary equipment, adequate personnel, and working space? Yes or no. 
WISE: I don't know what delay you're speaking of. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Okay. It--yes or no, it took King County four or five years to transition to all mail voting right? 
WISE: No. 
RODNEY DAVIS: How long did it take? 
WISE: When we tran--we went a decade ago to vote by mail. And I'm not sure of, like, the actual process. It did--I mean--we had I think nine--I think 86 percent of our voters were already permanent absentee voters at that point. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Okay. I understand the procurement process for high speed sorting machines can take some time, not to mention staff training. If a state started today it would be impossible for them to come up with the equipment, personnel, spacing needed by November. Yes or no. 
WISE: It depends on how many absentee voters they have. So we're already processing mail ballots right now right? I mean every jurisdiction has some amount of absentee voters so it just depends on how big. 
RODNEY DAVIS: I don't have a lot of time and I don't want to be like some of my colleagues on other committees and have to reclaim my time. I understand Washington state like my home state of Illinois is a member of the ERIC system which helps 30 states and D.C. keep their voter rolls up to date by comparing information across states. 
(INAUDIBLE) ERIC has benefitted King County by ensuring you were able to send ballots to voters at the correct address. Right? 
WISE: Correct. Yes. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you. The Postal Service's operational issues are new and recently 538 found that more than 30 states (INAUDIBLE) over the Postal Service deadlines. Can I ask (INAUDIBLE). Thank you. 
More than 30 states have mail ballot requests and return deadline incompatible with longstanding Postal Service deadlines. With more Americans expected to vote by mail this fall, I'm concerned these dual issues are pushing us toward major election administration issues in November. So I appreciate your time, Ms. Wise, and I agree. We--we've got to be better at our election administration. 
While I have a little more time, Mr.--I would like to turn to you Secretary Padilla. 
PADILLA: Yes sir. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thanks for being here today. As you know, my office has sent you numerous letters requesting to meet with you and your staff but we've heard nothing back. So it's good we're finally able to discuss the serious election administration issues that I see occurring in California. But--you know--unfortunately we haven't been able to get this done beforehand. 
That is a little disappointing to me. I'm absolutely disgusted by the advertisement I showed earlier which was released by your association of Secretaries of State. You lead that group. The greatest theat--threat to the integrity of our elections is partisanship. I've seen no better example of destructive partisanship than that ad. 
So I think it's important to focus on the current and serious election administration issues in your home state of California. Rejected ballots, bungled registration lists, and rampant ballot harvesting. NPR says that over 100,000 California mail ballots were rejected this year alone. Studies tell us young voters and people of color usually pay the price. No well managed system should have so many ballots rejected. 
In case you're not aware, the National Voter Registration Act requires you to maintain accurate voter registration lists. I say this because considering how many times you've been sued or threatened to be sued for noncompliance with the NVRA I'm not sure this is getting through. You even entered into a legal settlement recently that forces you to comply with the law. 
But apparently that wasn't enough because just this past April you received a letter that indicated that California is still not in compliance with the NVRA, particularly those sections requiring deceased or ineligible registrants to be removed. Are you aware of how many California registra--registrants on your voter rolls are likely deceased or have moved out of state? 
PADILLA: So with the multiple questions there so if you afford me a few minutes I'll--I'll respond to each one of them. First of all, I agree we haven't been able to set up a call or a meeting. But I do believe my office has been responsive to every question and request for information that your office has made of mine, number one. 
Number two, I couldn't agree more that the fundamental right to vote--to making it easier for eligible citizens to register to vote and to stay registered and to cast their ballot should not be a partisan issue. But when you see different policies that are being implemented in different states that have the net affect of making it harder and specifically make it--making it harder disproportionately on young people or communities of color, et cetera, low--lower income families to register, stay registered, and to vote then it does have a discriminatory effect and we absolutely stand up against that. 
To your question about vote-by-mail ballots that were rejected in our primary, I will tell you that the lion's share of those were ballots that were either postmarked after the primary election or arrived very late beyond our postmark plus three law in California. All the more reason to extend our postmark plus three to postmark plus 17 for the November general election so more ballots can and will be counted. 
You know if we're worried about some of the--the effects of-- 
LOFGREN: --The gentleman's time has expired so if you could very quickly wrap up for the remaining question Mr. Secretary-- 
PADILLA: --Sure. Sure. So if we're really concerned about--you know--the--the unfortunate disenfranchisement of so many eligible citizens then we should fully fund the U.Stal--U.S. Postal Service and we should fully fund elections. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much. Mr. Raskin, the gentleman from Maryland is now recognized for five minutes. 
RASKIN: Madam Chair, thank you very much. And I'm actually greatly reassured by the testimony from our Secretaries of State and these election officials that we're ready to go and we should stop spreading anxiety and disinformation about the elections. 
I--I confess that I'm a little bit baffled by my friend the ranking member's indignant complaint about the Democratic Secretary of State's completely unexceptionable TV advertisement about white supremity--white supremacy being both a political ideology and a strategy for maintaining power. 
One would think that the whole history of disenfranchisement in our country with poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, white primaries, and so on would vindicate the accuracy and the passion of that ad. And indeed when the gentleman repeatedly invokes over the top rhetoric, I don't know what he's referring to. 
But I--it strikes me as over the top rhetoric to link this ad presumably made over the last several months--I don't know--maybe they could--the Secretary from California could tell us. But linking that ad to the violent assault on our colleagues on June fourth, 2017--something that took place three years ago--that strikes me as true over the top rhetoric. 
In any event, we face two key obstacles today as Secretary Padilla puts it. One is COVID-19. The other is the continuing disinformation about voting which is scaring people and confusing people. And there is this incessant stream of propaganda from the highest levels of government trying to scare people about different forms of voting. 
Now I want to focus on ballot drop boxes, because they are one of the ways that the states are working to address all of the problems caused by COVID-19 which of course has afflicted more than five million of our people and killed more than 180,000 of them. At least 34 states and the District of Columbia have used or plan to use ballot drop boxes this year including my home state of Maryland. 
The president recently attacked ballot drop boxes via twitter claiming that ballot boxes are a voter security disaster that will facilitate fraud. So, I wanted to come to Secretary of State Wise if I could--or, I'm sorry. You're not a Secretary of State. You're an election official. Ms. Wise, you say that in King County you've been using ballot drop boxes for years without any problems. Is that right? Can you explain how secure they are? What are the benefits of drop boxes? 
And then also how did a school bus hit a drop box and how did the drop box survive and the school bus did not make it. 
WISE: We've had drop boxes since we moved to vote by mail 10 years ago. So we went from--I was first elected we had 10. We now have 70. That means 96 percent of our voters in King County have a drop box within just a three mile radius of their home. And we've seen studies out of the University of Washington that proximity to a drop box increases turnout. So drop boxes are incredibly important. 
They served a really im--important service especially when we didn't have prepaid postage. But now that I've secured prepaid postage voters really have both options. These are secure drop boxes. These drop boxes are in fact manufactured by a company called Vote Armor. And more than half of our voters use our drop boxes and they come in really handy for our voters that maybe want to wait til election day but a little bit more of our procrastinators. And so election day and the day before in fact we see 50 percent of voters turnout to those drop boxes. 
They are securely designed thousand pound boxes. We had the opportunity to host students at our facility. We have 99,000 square feet where we process our ballots and so we hosted about 700 students. Not at the same time, but that--that's why the school bus was on site was to bring the students and the driver just mistook the turn, crashed into the drop box. The drop box was completely fine and--and the--the bus didn't look so great. 
RASKIN: Well--but I hope all the kids were okay. But that's a great advertisement for drop boxes and their sturdiness and their reliability. You also testify, Ms. Wise, that Washington is one of the five states I think it is that have conducted universal vote-by-mail elections which is another target of the president who says that vote--vote by mail promotes fraud, it's not trustworthy, et cetera, et cetera. 
Has your state seen any significant increase in incidents of voter fraud because you're doing universal vote by mail? And what do you think of the president's continuing attacks on states like yours? 
WISE: There hasn't been cases of fraud. I--in my testimony as I said, the percentage rate of--of fraud happening--and this is when King County compared our data in ERIC to 30 other states in which those voters were registered. There's no fraud happening-- 
RASKIN: --And you said it was one hundred thousandth of one percent fraud-- 
WISE: --That's correct. That--that's accurate. 
RASKIN: So--so wh--what do you make of this attack on universal vote by mail? 
LOFGREN: The--the gentleman's time is expired so if you could have an answer promptly that would be wonderful. 
WISE: In Washington state we're all permanent absentee voters. If you want to call it universal mail-in or whatever you want to call it, it is the same thing as permanent absentee voters. When a voter signs up in Washington state they're signing up to be a pernent--permanent absentee voter. 
RASKIN: Thank you very much. I yield back, Madam Chair. 
LOFGREN: Thank you so much. The gentlelady from California Ms. Davis is recognized for five minutes. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and thank you to all of our witnesses here today. I appreciate your--your joining us. You know, one of the best but least known components of a good absentee ballot system is ballot tracking. Which lets voters be able to tell online whether their ballots have been sent out, whether they've been received back, and whether their votes have counted. And I put language into the defense bill some years ago to require ballot tracking for the military and overseas voters and my hope is that elections officials would open up to that for all voters as many of them have. 
But I'm concerned that most voters are unaware that they can track their ballots. Many registrars don't seem to do enough to let voters know about it and it's buried on some of their websites. And so a lot of voters truly don't--don't know about this service. Mr. Padilla--Mr.--Mr. Secretary, I know that you've been working on this. Can you tell us how you promote where is my ballot and have you had secretaries of states look to you to--to--to help them to be able to do this as well? 
Is it too late for them to do that about--you know--what is--what is the pr--not--not in detail the procedure but what--what--how--how can they afford themselves again providing this service to voters? 
PADILLA: Right. No, appreciate the question. And so I--I should say we I don't believe are the first state to expand statewide. Colorado might be the first state to have done it statewide. We've had ballot tracking prior in California. We had about 28 counties participate in the primary election. Voters in this counties had a great experience. But for purposes of November we are expanding and mandating it statewide. 
So (INAUDIBLE) soon be launched (INAUDIBLE) voter education campaign about (INAUDIBLE). So I think we're off to a great start to get as many (INAUDIBLE) as possible. (INAUDIBLE) country (INAUDIBLE) organized with the national association of secretaries of state where we exchange these best practices and good ideas. I know many others are looking at it some with (INAUDIBLE) county by county. We chose to invest some of our--the funding that we rec--from the CARES Act and HAVA to underwrite the ballot tracking expansion statewide per county. So it would--it didn't become a fiscal burden for individual counties. 
And last I just want to say it's not just a great tool for voters. Right? The transparency of your ballot moving its way through the mail delivery process, confirmation when it's been received and counted. Great for transparency for the voters but it provides a great diagnostic tool--a dashboard for us to identify any bottlenecks or delays in the postal delivery. And so we can then work with regional or local postal officials to make sure those ballots are delivered on a timely basis. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you. I wonder if Ms. Wise, Ms. McReynolds if you'd like to comment as well particularly on that. And really at--making it--if more prevalent and again giving voters the confidence that they can check this information. 
MCREYNOLDS: Yeah, I'm happy to weigh in for a second. Actually in Denver--Denver was the first pioneering office for ballot tracking now back in 2009, so 11 years ago that we created that. And then there's a commercial provider and there's also a non-profit provider. And then some states have built tools in house. So over 30 states actually offer tracking on their websites. And there's actually still states right now that I've been working with to expand and implement ballot tracking like what California has done statewide for this election. 
So there is--the window is closing but there is absolutely time to do that. I've been working with various states to try to get that implemented and set up now. And--you know--there's a--a lot of states are in the process of--of trying to do that now. And certainly voters knowing about it is critical and there's lots of ways to do that through voter education campaign or even in a lot of states when you register to vote you can actually select the option to get electronic information about voting from the election officials. 
And so you can basically opt in at that point in the registration process in various states as well. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Yeah. Thank you. I--I appreciate that. And--and yet it--it feels as if there're a lot more people who could be doing it than are. So we--we have to do a better job of--of that. I appreciate it. 
Secretary Padilla, I want to just give you an opportunity very quickly to--to respond a little bit. Because the fact that you're sending ballots to every voter in California somehow seems suspect. And I--I wonder if you could just re--respond to that that--you know--it--it opens the door to more fraud. If you'd like to do that. 
PADILLA: Sure. No. Appreciate it and I'll try to be concise. You know--vote by mail is nothing new in California and for many other states across the country. California's not the only one. No excuse vote by mail specifically has been in place in California for a couple of decades. So vote by mail is absolutely convenient for voters. It has proven to be secure as well. You know--among the security measures that we have in place--you know--starting with the ballots themselves. 
You know--it's not quite like currency but think specific paper types, watermarks, other distinguishing features of ballots that would be pretty darn hard to introduce fake ballots into the system. Right? Alarm bells would go off almost immediately. 
Second, vote-by-mail ballots must be returned in the official envelope provided to each voter. Each with a unique barcode for tracking purposes not just through the mail but for maintaining the voter's record of when somebody's voted to help guard against double voting. The all important signature verification, right? When a voter returns their ballot they must sign the back of the return envelope. And the first thing county officials do is check that signature against the signature on file as part of that voter's record to help confirm the identity of the voter. 
If the voter forgot to sign the envelope or the signatures do not match, California law requires counties to attempt to contact the voter to rectify any signature issues. Because we want to make sure a legitimate vote is counted. And if the voter says hey that wasn't me well then obviously we have something to look into. So-- 
SUSAN DAVIS: --If I can interrupt. Sometimes people are afraid that--that--the--the voter has--is deceased. And--and somehow or other someone's gonna get that vote-- 
PADILLA: --So on list maintenance, no. County officials work constantly to maintain the accuracy of their rolls. They cross reference coroner's data for example to identify deceased individuals to remove them from the rolls. In California they also check-- 
LOFGREN: --The (INAUDIBLE) time's expired. But I'm gonna go back to you when it's my turn Secretary Padilla to finish this. 
PADILLA: Okay. 
LOFGREN: So I'd like to recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Butterfield at this point for five minutes. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for convening this very important hearing this afternoon. I--it's Friday afternoon here on the east coast and I did not want to put on a necktie but I did it and I'm reporting for duty. Thank you so very much. 
To my friend the ranking member, thank you for playing that video a few minutes ago. I--I want to associate myself totally not with your comments but I want to associate my--myself with the content of the video. You touted the benefit of the Voting Rights Act in your remarks but you must understand that the Voting Rights Act is--is not fully enforceable now. It has been wounded and--and your party refuses to fix it. But I just wanted to set the record straight that I for one associate myself with the video. 
Thank you Madam Chair for taking a moment to recognize this important day in American history. I--I recall this day 57 years ago. Oh, do I recall it so very well. I was 16 years of age and my dad rounded up my best friend and me and put us in the car and--and drove us to Washington, D.C. through the night. I remember it so well. And thank you for making reference to that. 
Like many Americans I have been watching the--the political conventions over the last two weeks. The Democratic Convention last week and the Republican Convention this week. And during each one of these conventions many of the speakers said that this was the most consequential election of our lifetime. And they are so right. This election will determine--it will determine whether we will have a democracy and it will determine quite frankly whether we have a president that follows the rule of law. 
I was very, very disappointed last evening to see President Trump use the precious real estate of the White House as a political backdrop for his reelection. Not only was it inappropriate to have this event at the White House, but it violated the Hatch Act and it violated CDC guidelines for protecting the public health. And you know, I was reading this morning it--it was reported that some of the delegates at the Charlotte convention now have COVID. And let's pray that those attending last night will not find themselves or their neighbors affected by the virus. 
But this hearing is important. It's incredibly important. As Ms. Gupta said early on in--in her opening remarks, we must have a safe, fair, and accessible election. So let me--let me just ask one or two questions of Ms. Gupta and then I will--I will yield back. But Ms. Gupta, I--I remember when you were at the Department of Justice and thank you for your years of service. And wish you were back at the Department of Justice and--and I'll just leave it there. Thank you so very much. 
Ms. Gupta, at the recent Senate and House hearings on operational changes at the Postal Service, the Postmaster noted several times that the sorting machines that were removed from the post offices were not needed. And he refused to agree to their reinstatement. He also refused to make the commitment that election mail will be treated as first-class mail. Although this is an accepted practice. 
Ms. Gupta, what is the potential impact of the Postal Service removing sorting and mailbox equipment and not treating election mail as first class mail for voters during the upcoming election. 
GUPTA: Thank you, sir for the question. This 671 mail sorting machines were removed from 49 states in the last few months under Postmaster General DeJoy's leadership. And every sorting machine actually has the ability to process about 30,000 pieces of mail per hour. And--and so the refusal to restore them really gets to some of the functionality of a system that Americans rely on and are gonna rely on now more than ever amid a pandemic where surges of Americans will be voting by mail to protect their public health. 
And so there's a lot of concern that if the--the decommissioned machines and mailboxes are not restored that it could really undermine or slow down the system by--for voting by mail. It's also potent--got the potential to confuse voters, to add to disinformation. And so this is why there's been such an urgency to--to get these post office--post mailboxes restored. 
You know--the pe--voters need to have confidence in--in the vote. There's--there's also--there's the policy changes and then there's the vot--the confidence that voters need. And amidst so much disinformation voters need to feel like the U.S. Postal Service is gonna be a reliable service to vote by mail. On the first class mail piece of this, it is really critical that vote-by-mail ballots are treated as first class mail and have expedited priority. First class mail moves significantly faster than marketing mail and in past years it's been a courtesy that the USPS has often treated election mail as first class mail. 
And so it's critical that Postmaster General DeJoy issue a formal policy. He gave some verbal commitment to treating some vote-by-mail ballots as this way but there's a need to formalize this policy which is why the bill that the House passed this past weekend really needs to become law. So that again, voters can have the confidence that this will be the case nationwide. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you. Thank you very much. I yield back. 
LOFGREN: Thank you so much. The gentleman yields back. I might--now like to recognize the gentlelady from Ohio, the chairperson of our Election Subcommittee, Congresswoman Fudge. 
FUDGE: Thank you very much Madam Chair. I appreciate it. I really don't have any questions. But I just tell you, I--I listened to the ranking member who is so typically misleading. The bill that we put in the HEROES Act does not require, does not request universal vote by mail. And he knows it. What it does is give people options so that they can be safe when they decide to go out and vote. He knows that. 
I don't know why he continues to say it. We have a president that votes by mail. And then tells the American people that they should not. It is no wonder to me that we have destroyed the confidence in every single institution in this country. People have lost faith in government. They don't believe in the president, the Senate, the House, nothing. Now we can't even believe in the Postal Service, a place where my uncle worked for 42 years. 
I have two Postmasters in my family. And they are appalled by what they are seeing today. The post office was a place where when we came out of school back when my uncle was coming out of college you couldn't get a job anyplace else. So they carried mail. He carried mail for 42 years. And it takes DeJoy and this group to destroy it. 
You know--it is just amazing to me that we talk about wanting to believe in the Constitution. That everybody has a right to vote. But day after day they put roadblock after roadblock. It's just lip service. They really don't want everybody to vote. Because if they did, they would try to make it easier and not harder. 
He asked someone about their purging of their voter rolls. The last purge we had--and to the credit of my Republican Secretary of State. He reached out to places like the NAACP, the Urban League, churches, et cetera. He found 50,000 people in one week that should never have been purged. In one week. So we know that what they do is not perfect. 
And today--and I--and I hope Mr. Davis reads this today. Our Secretary of State published a list of 116,000 people who are going to be purged after November's election to make sure that they have an opportunity to save their registration. That's what we ought to be doing instead of trying to tear down everything that is good in this country. Which is what they want to do because they figure if we make it difficult and we just let people stay at home they won't vote and we will win. 
You know--he keeps talking about bipartisanship. There is no bipartisanship with these people. You know--it just gets to be--you know--always talking about things like fraud. The only fraud is that they want people to believe that they care about our vote. They don't. It is just disheartening to me that at this time when people are dealing with so much--when they've lost their jobs, when they can't get their unemployment insurance, when their kids are hungry and they don't know if they can go to school--that we are playing these games instead of making it easy for people to go to the polls. 
And now people are wondering if they go to the polls--if they vote by mail if their vote will even count. I mean--I don't know any handwriting experts that work at these Boards of Elections. My signature is different now than it was at 18 when I first registered to vote. It's not going to be an exact match. And so they play all of these games. 
So Madam Chair, I--I really don't have any questions. I--I just want to say that let's stop the charade. Just admit you don't want people to vote. Just admit that you don't care. And it'll be better because at least people will know how honest you are. I yield back. 
LOFGREN: Gentlelady yields back. The gentleman from California Mr. Aguilar is now recognized for five minutes. 
AGUILAR: Thank you, Chair Lofgren. And I--I share the frustration that--that my colleague Chair Fudge had with some of the statements that we've heard. 
Secretary Padilla, on election night Americans are used to hearing about projected winners. Especially on the night of the election. But what some voters may not know are that those projections are based off of unofficial results that often take time to line up with the eventual certified results. And certifying results takes time. And each jurisdiction and each state sets requirements for that. 
Can you discuss the process for canvassing and certifying an election in California and why in some cases it takes more time to ensure that the official results are accurate? 
PADILLA: Certainly. And I appreciate the question cause it is important for us to set the expectations now both with the press and with the public of what election night may be like. You know--I think that California has developed a reputation for taking a little while to finish counting ballots and certifying results but it's all for good reason. 
You know--in California we're--we're unique just the size of our electorate. You know--we're approaching 21 million voters on the roll so the sheer volume takes longer than in many other states with much smaller populations. But some of the policies that we have in place starting with vote by mail. You know--I mentioned in my testimony that we have extended now the postmark plus three policy to postmark plus 17 for purposes of this November. So come election day, we won't even have all the ballots in hand to--to finish counting. 
It's gonna take days if not weeks depending on the health of the Postal Service for ballots to arrive in county elections offices. When the polls close at eight o'clock in California we start hearing some numbers. Those are votes that came in early enough to county elections offices so they can be prepared and processed and ready to be counted and we start providing preliminary results. 
You know--the overall experience is that we have a decent sense of the outcome of most contests on election night. But for close contests and for final results it does take weeks. Because in that canvas period that you reference, congressman, we have the signature verification process that is happening. California's one of the states that offers same-day registration opportunity where we have to process the registration before we count the ballots. 
If there's a need for a voter to cast a provisional ballot because of some issue when they tried to vote in-person--you know--that's a--a manual process that also takes a few minutes. But--you know--we go through these lengths to preserve both the integrity of the election and the right to vote for every eligible citizen. And let's not forget the required post-election audits that are required of every county after every election. So--you know--in California counties have a month after the election to certify their results and then my office takes another week to certify statewide results. 
The issue for this November is that so many other states ramping up vote by mail significantly possibly for the first time. You know--think Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio, Arizona, and others if the--the presidential contest is too close to call on election night in enough key states we may not know the final outcome for at least a few days. And our worry going back to the disinformation that I spoke of during my testimony is that we're going to be hearing--you know--a lot of conspiracy theories and lies during that timeframe that threaten to undermine confidence in our elections. 
The public and the press need to understand this is simply the process at work. It's maintaining the integrity of the process. And it's better to be patient. We want to get the vote count right, not to rush to get it fast. 
AGUILAR: Yeah and it's--it's important to set those expectations now and I appreciate it. I just--I--for the life of me I just can't understand why the ranking member spends so much time devoted to California elections laws and--and spreading his own misinformation about our processes. Maybe he wants to--to move to California. You know--that's something that is--that is available to him as a--as a private citizen in--in future lives. 
On August twentieth--and this'll go to Secretary of State Padilla and--and Director Wise. The president mentioned that he might send sheriffs, law enforcement and attorneys general to in-person voting locations. Days letter--later the Acting Secretary of Homeland Chad Wolf stated that his department lacks the authority to police polling stations. Can you explain how the use of law enforcement in in-person voting locations could affect turnout as well as other issues and concerns you see with this possible course of action. Secretary of State Padilla then Director Wise. 
PADILLA: Sure. And I'll--and I'll try to be brief. Look, even before I get to the law enforcement question, President Trump has been publicly honest about why he's trying to undermine the Postal Service and--and vote by mail. He's trying to stop vote by mail. More recently he's threatening to send law enforcement officials to--to monitor polling locations. By the way, both of those actions violate California law. So I want to make that absolutely clear. 
But if you look at attacks on vote by mail, he's trying to make vote by mail harder forcing people to vote in-person. Now the presence of law enforcement, which is against the law, would only serve to intimidate people trying to vote in-person. Put those two together, it's nothing but a recipe to try to suppress the vote. Plain and simple. 
LOFGREN: The gentleman's time is expired but, Ms. Wise, if you could very briefly respond, and then I will go to my five minutes. 
WISE: You know, we have political party observers for both parties at our drop boxes as well as as we're processing ballots on hand. There's no need to have additional observation if that's what's needed. We don't need any more people there at the drop boxes and vote centers as we really try to service our voters. 
Our voters in Washington state can also register all the way up to an election day. So we have the security that we need on site and we're prepared to handle our--our--our voters. And anything else to that would really cause intimidation, concern for election administrators as a civil servant and to our voters. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much. I-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --Madam Chair, I didn't want to interrupt the witnesses but I got a couple points of order to raise. 
LOFGREN: I'm sorry. 
RODNEY DAVIS: I--I didn't want to interrupt the witnesses but I have a couple points of order to raise. First off, I notice that some of our colleagues are not following the rules you laid out to stay on video and keep their video open. So I'd appreciate that be--that reminder going out again-- 
LOFGREN: --Yes-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --These are the video conferencing rules that were passed and put into place. The second point of order I would go back to the--the partisan performance of my colleague, Ms. Fudge, who mentioned that I want to--to allow people not to--clearly my opening statement stated I want to stop disenfranchisement. To unfairly attack (INAUDIBLE) people of color-- 
LOFGREN: --Mr. Davis, that's not the--that's not a point of order. But you and I-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --(INAUDIBLE) the partisanship is coming from (INAUDIBLE)-- 
LOFGREN: --You will have an opportunity to make an additional statement when it's your turn. It is not. The chair now recognized myself for my five minutes of question and you will be heard after that Mr. Davis. 
I--I promised Mr. Padilla to go back to you to let you finish the explanation of how sending ballots to every registered voter is secure. If you could briefly finish addressing that issue I would appreciate it. 
PADILLA: Sure. I think what I was in the middle of talking about some of the list maintenance that every county elections office does to maintain the accuracy of the rolls as best as possible. You know--cross referencing with coroner's records for example to remove deceased individuals from the voter rolls in California, individuals in state prison who are on parole for a felony conviction lose the ability to vote until their time served is done. And so they cross reference with our Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to search for names as well. 
You know--here's a bright spot in automatic voter registration in California. Since the launch of the program, yes more than two previously eligible but unregistered Californians are now added to the rolls. Another roughly five million individuals that have--that previously registered were able to update their registration, again leading to more accurate rolls. 
And maybe close to five million individuals that were afforded the opportunity to update confirmed their record is accurate. And that's just the transactions through the DMV. So a great chunk of our current electorate that has recently either updated or confirmed the accuracy of their information. 
We talked about the ballot tracking tool earlier. We have another pu--tool online for voters to verify their registration status. That's also a core element of our voter outreach campaign between now and election day encouraging people to vo--go online and verify their registration including their address so that before county elections officials mail those ballots out we know we're sending them to the current address. And in the interest of time I'll just acknowledge prior in the conversation I--I mentioned some of the very safeguards to confirm the integrity of those vote-by-mail ballots when they come in, signature verification, et cetera. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much. Ms. Wise, would you address how Washington makes sure that there's security in these mailed in ballots. 
WISE: Washington state also--it does signature verification of each of our voters. I can attest myself I have been challenged twice for my signature changing over the years. And so if a signature starts to change we are proactive in reaching out to those voters. 
But in vote by mail that is how you ensure that the voter voted their ballot and no one else did. But as the Secretary Patilla--Padilla already said, we do a lot of list maintenance here in Washington state. Between doing felony checks with courts of Social Security Administration or public health, we're constantly scrubbing those voter rolls to make sure that they're up to date and that they're accurate. We're mailing ballots out in Washington state to all of our voters at least twice a year, which also keeps our voter rolls up to date and accurate. 
And this--these are secure elections that we've been doing, again, for over a decade in Washington state. 
LOFGREN: Thank you very much. I'd just like to--to talk again about how long it takes. Last--in 2018 Speaker Ryan--and--was complaining about how long it took for the vote to be counted in California. Now obviously if we're accepting ballots that were postmarked on election day or prior for 17 days after the election we're not even gonna have all the ballots in hand by the time--you know--on election day. 
What percentage do we think Secretary Padilla will be votes by mail? And I've got a--you know--note that both parties have observers at all of the Secretary of States--I mean of the Registrar of Voters offices and not a single complaint was filed in 2018. No--no complaint was filed cause there was no problem even though people were complaining here in Washington. 
Can you address that issue? How--what percentage of the votes will not even be in hand on election day? 
PADILLA: So--I mean--that's a--it's a--tough to really ballpark but it wouldn't be surprising if half the ballots or half the votes weren't in hand when the polls close on election night because of the volume that comes in by mail so close to election day. To--you know--I mentioned one marker during my testimony that for the March primary 72 percent of ballots cast were vote-by-mail ballots. 
Now the majority of those coming in by mail. Significant chunks also coming in through drop boxes. And a growing number of people who choose to receive their ballot by mail filling it out at home at their leisure and then dropping them off in-person. 
So I wouldn't be surprised if that 72 percent markup goes up to--to 80 percent or closer to 90 percent. 
LOFGREN: Okay. My time is expired and so I will turn now to the ranking member for his five minutes on the second round. You are recognized Mr. Davis. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I--I'm glad the witnesses and the people watching on CSPAN get to see why I always say at almost every hearing the biggest threat to our election process and election security is partisanship. It's very disappointing that a couple of colleagues actually--actually talk about being more partisan. 
I'm the thirteenth most bipartisan member of Congress according to the Lugar Center. I'll compare--well--with almost all of my colleagues about how to work together. It's disappointing though that we also see a ta--a lot of talk about accuracy when it comes to the election process and inaccuracy on this--on this hearing from some of my colleagues. 
The HEROES Act clearly states that if there is an emergency declaration in order that all voters on every registration roll would get a ballot mailed to them. That's the bill that was passed. That's what it says. I--I'm not making things up. I'm very disappointed that some of my colleagues today have decided to actually be encouraged by the hateful rhetoric that we see in our--our political environment today. That's the partisanship that I'm talking about. 
There is--that's the type of rhetoric that allowed my friends to get shot on a baseball field. It's wrong. By somebody who was screaming healthcare while they were firing. And you talk about no fraud. We didn't seat an elected member of Congress because of ballot harvesting fraud in North Carolina's ninth district. I--I just--it--it--it's like Groundhog Day and--every single hearing it is the same thing. And it's--it's--it gets frustrating. 
I'm sorry to the witnesses but Mr.--Mr. Palmer, I got a question for you. You know--we want to make sure that every lawful vote is counted this November and people can vote safely and securely. You know--the EAC's put out on a bipartisan basis a suggested timeline for when states can move to vote by mail. Can you briefly explain why it takes a long time to move to vote by mail? And very briefly please because I've got some more questions. 
PALMER: Sure. I--I mean, in our discussions it's a significant transition that most of the leaders (INAUDIBLE) state (INAUDIBLE) significant absentee or permanent absentee category of individuals who are voting that way. Most of the states in the country--a majority at least have less than 10 percent absentee vote--voters that vote by absentee. It takes time for voters to get used to voting by mail and being accustomed to the Postal Service transmission. 
That's why often the lock boxes become important. But I think that we found that after COVID discussions that we needed to prepare for increased absentee and mail voting, not necessarily wholesale transitions to all vote-by-mail systems. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you. I--I gotta ru--I gotta move on Don. I apologize. I--I want to get back to the question that I asked Secretary Padilla. You know--the--the election integrity project found over 450,000 California registrants on your voter rolls are likely deceased or have moved out of state. Since you received this letter last April can you tell us approximately how many of these 450,000 plus registans--registrants you have removed that would get a ballot mailed to them if the provisions in the HEROES Act were implemented because we are in a national emergency. 
PADILLA: So, again I don't have precise numbers for you. But rest assured we are working with each and every county to perform the ongoing list maintenance. Several counties including Los Angeles which was a big focus of that effort has recently for example sent mailers to every active registered voter in a--in an attempt to identify those that may no longer be at their address and to verify the address of those who are. 
And ultimately even if a ballot goes to somebody who might have moved it doesn't mean that ballot is being cast. We have the security measures that I've articulated already that would prevent a fraudulent ballot from being cast by mail. Voter fraud is exceedingly, exceedingly rare. So the current safeguards are working. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Mr. Secretary, it--it was a--not rare enough to not seat a member of Congress in--in one of our congressional districts-- 
PADILLA: --That was North Carolina, sir. Not California. 
RODNEY DAVIS: I agree but it's the same harvesting process. And we have to make sure there-- 
PADILLA: --So--so--so let me address that cause you've brought it up a few times-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --I gotta-- 
PADILLA: --So here is the law in California-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --And--and we just mentioned earlier unfortunately that the nation--the NVRA's not being followed. That's the law too, sir. That's why I question California so much. Because there're too many questions about what laws you want to follow and what laws you actually do. It's--that's a process that we can--I--I certainly would have liked to have met with you during the (INAUDIBLE) conferences we requested. We did not get a response from your team. 
I--I offer again I'd love to sit down with you on an extended basis to have a--a meeting and talk about these issues. Because 10 minutes in a partisan hearing clearly is not enough to get the answers and for you to actually get the answers out of me that you'd like. So thank you sir. I appreciate everybody's time today. Disappointed in the rhetoric once again. But I look forward to working with our witnesses in the future. 
LOFGREN: Gentleman's time is expired. The gentleman from Maryland Mr. Raskin is now recognized for five minutes. 
RASKIN: Chair, thank you very much. Well I suppose then the disappointment is mutual on our two sides about the rhetoric. My friend, Mr. Davis, says the biggest threat to elections in partisanship but he--I--you know--I started to think about that because of course partisanship is reflection of a free society. Under the First Amendment people can form political parties and then we have partisan competition. The alternative to that is a one party state, a dictatorship. An authoritarian state--you know--some kind of strong man Putin in Russian, Orban in Hungary, or any of the other friends of Donald Trump around the world. 
I guess a one-party state would get rid of the problem of partisanship. The problem is partisanship invading the electoral system. So that's--like--you know--Katherine Harris in Florida in 2000 when she was both the chair of the Bush campaign and also the head of the elections. That's certainly something we've got to deal with through the system of federalism where the states have moved away from partisan brawlers running elections and instead trying to move towards independent non-partisan administration of our elections. 
But of course, the leading partisan in this electoral process in 2020 is Donald Trump who calls ballot drop boxes a voter security disaster. Who said he wants to get rid of all the ballot harvest in a tweet and then we learned that he gave his ballot to a third party to go and mail. And then his incessant attack on the post office where he opposed what we passed in the HEROES Act and he said quote on national tv, ""They want $25 billion for the post office. Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots."" 
It could not be clearer that that is partisan sabotage of our ability to have a free and fair election in the United States of America in 2020. I would like to ask some of our guests who've come from around the country. I--the--the partisanship is obvious coming from Donald Trump and his sycophants. But isn't this also an attack on federalism? When he attacks what Washington state is doing in terms of its drop--drop-off boxes or its direct mail-in voting. When they attack California or North Carolina or any state where they think the people are going to vote against Donald Trump they attack the electoral system. 
Isn't that a serious threat to federalism? And I'd like to ask Ms. Wise and Secretary Padilla about that. 
WISE: I'm a non-partisan election official that has appreciated running these elections in a non-partisan way for our voters in Washington state and for King County. And I think that what I do know is that voters deeply appreciate the opportunity to vote by mail. One of the things that worries me is if we talk about rejection rates, how--how do you account for how many people stopped waiting in line after six hours? 
I believe it is peoples fundamental right to have their ballot wherever they want it. If that's by mail or if that's at--at a vote center we need to provide the opportunity for our voters. So as a non-partisan election official who's dedicated half of my entire life to running elections I'm saddened to see a politicized administrative attacks on my postal worker. My grandmother was also a postal worker. And election administration. And to demonize election workers. 
We are civil servants, a lot of us non-partisan just trying to do the good work to--so that our voters can have their voice heard. We fundamentally believe that democracy is at its finest when all voices are heard. And how you do that is you remove barriers therefore increasing access. But I question how many people do we lose when we make them stand in line? When they have to go to the right place out of 700 places. 
RASKIN: Yeah I appreciate that very much. And there are those who clearly want to blame the messenger if the election officials bring back a result that's untoward to them. For the first time in American history we've got a president who's saying I'm not gonna necessarily follow the result and people are questioning whether he's actually gonna leave office. 
I mean this is a deranged situation that we're in. Secretary Padilla, what--what about you? Do you interpret this as an offense against federalism to be questioning all the state election officials and secretaries of state about balloting processes that have evolved over the decades towards greater inclusion? 
PADILLA: Look, it's--I think it's both offensive and insulting not just to state elections officials but to local elections officials across the country like Ms. Wise. And the untold number of volunteers, people who sign up to work as poll workers to help administer our elections in--in-person. Look, in--in California we believe in both election security and accessibility. It is not an either or. And now we have to be worried about accessibility, security, and safety because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Voter enfranchisement is not voter fraud. In Cali--you know--it's--it's come up a couple times so I want to talk about the options for how these ballots come back in. In California-- 
LOFGREN: --The gentleman's time is expired so I'll give you an opportunity to talk about it when it's my turn. And the gentlelady from California is recognized for five minutes. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. And Madam Chair, before I ask a question I just wanted to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the Science Advances study dated August twenty-sixth, 2020 by Michael Barber and John Holbein-- 
LOFGREN: --Without objection-- 
SUSAN DAVIS: --Okay. And ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the article for Politico dated October twe--August twenty-sixth. Intel officials contradict Trump on voting by mail. 
LOFGREN: Without objection (INAUDIBLE) included-- 
SUSAN DAVIS: --Thank you very much. I--I wanted to ask Ms. McReynolds. Ms. McReynolds, several excuse states--those who require any number of excuses as--as we know from people including whether or not you're pregnant by the way--have changed their rules to allow a one time exemption so the concern about COVID counts as an allowable reason to request an absentee ballot. And this of course is--is better than nothing. But certainly no substitute for eliminating excuses entirely. 
Do you think those voters in those states are aware that they can now vote by mail by virtue of the fact that COVID is a concern and a fear that they might have? Do you think that they're aware and how can we best educate them and make sure that excuse situations run smoothly? Have you actually seen whether there's a--a big attempt to do that in these ex--ex--excuse communities and excuse states and counties. 
MCREYNOLDS: Yeah, I appreciate the question and I actually do--we have significant concerns about voter confusion in some of these states because of these changes. And frankly because the states lack money to communicate and do voter outreach efforts to actually let voters know about that. 
Also in--for instance a state like Missouri they have absentee voting and there's one process for that and that requires an excuse, then some extra steps. And then they created new--a new process for what's called mail-in voting. And for mail-in voting you cannot drop off your ballot in-person but if you apply for an absentee ballot you can. And so the Secretary of State yesterday announced that they're actually not gonna roll out the boxes that they've actually purchased. 
So they literally have ballot boxes in storage that Missouri's not gonna roll out. So yes, I do--I'm very concerned about confusion especially in the states with excuses and age limitations like Texas. If you're over 65 it's one process if you're under 65 it's another. And I think that that is extremely confusing to voters. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Okay. And maybe I'll--I'll ask all the participants on--on the panel here whether--whether they think that no excuse is--is the better way to go or if they think that those states that continue to have people actually being (INAUDIBLE) in many cases and maybe even choose not to vote as a result that that's (INAUDIBLE) implemented as well. I just wonder if everybody would weigh in on that really quickly. 
PADILLA: I--I do. There--there's no reason for no excuse vote by mail to not be in effect nationally. The security measures show that it works. We maintain the integrity of the election and we make it convenient and safe for voters. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you. 
GUPTA: I would say, congresswoman, that especially amid the global pandemic it is more imperative now than ever that no excuse absentee voting be made available in every state. And states that continue to erect barriers to these--it's hard to understand the rationale for it given the--the experience without glitch in many other states that have been using the system for quite some time. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you. 
MCREYNOLDS: And I would add yes at the very least no excuse should be available in every state. I for one came from a state where we had no excuse and then we transitioned because of voters choosing this method of voting. I think that's a really important point here is that this isn't politicians or people pushing this down peoples throats. Voters themselves are opting in to vote this way across the country and it's their choice. It's not anybody else's choice, it's the voter's choice. 
So I would take it a step further based on my experience that I think the polls--for instance I was a part of creating in Colorado and that have happened elsewhere can take it to the next level. But at least for right now no excuse is absolutely critical. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you. 
WISE: I agree. No excuse across the country. 
SUSAN DAVIS: And Mr. Palmer. 
LOFGREN: It looks like Mr. Palmer--has your Wi-Fi gone out? There you are. 
PALMER: Congresswoman Da--Congresswoman Davis. Can you hear me? 
SUSAN DAVIS: Yes. Uh-huh, I can. 
LOFGREN: Thank you. 
PALMER: I--it looked like I got frozen. I think--I mean--the majority of states are taking the no excuse or excuse with COVID as the primary way to request a ballot. They see that as a secure (INAUDIBLE) that they're comfortable with. And so I see a lot of that in November. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Would you like to see no excuse voting be more universal in our country? 
PALMER: I think I'm very comfortable with no excuse absentee or no excuse mail. I think the--the primary reason that at least any fears I had was that--that ability to request from the voter to an election official confirms the identity and the address of the individual. And it gives a comfort level that a lot of legislatures and election officials are comfortable with across the country. 
SUSAN DAVIS: Thank you. 
LOFGREN: The gentlelady's time is expired. I'd like to recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Butterfield for five minutes at this point. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you again to the chair for convening this hearing today. This is a very healthy discussion. I hope we have a lot of listeners and viewers because this is a conversation that we must have. 
The ranking member was--was very vocal a few moments ago in talking about North Carolina, talking about the 2018 election in--in North Carolina nine and--and I'm somewhat of an expert on--on that--that subject. The record should be clear, Madam Chair. The record should be absolutely clear that--that Congress didn't seat the so-called winner in that election. Why? Because the Board of Elections didn't certify the election. 
The Board found substantial election fraud by Republican operatives. Republican operatives not only harvested ballots in that election but they destroyed the ballots. I remember it so very well. Investigators found that the Republican operatives had overseen a network of people who collected absentee ballots, which is a violation of our law, and then completed those ballots while they were working for Mark Harris who was the Republican nominee in that district. 
And so I just want the record to be perfectly clear. To Secretary Padilla, thank you for your testimony today and thank you for your patience with us. Nearly half of all registered uniform and overseas voters hold their legal voting residence in California, Florida, and the state of Washington. Uniformed service members continue to rely primarily on postal mail for their ballots and the most common reason for ballot rejection in 2018 was that the completed ballot was received after the state's receipt deadline. 
The goal should be that every eligible voter has access to the ballot. That's what I think it should be. Every voter should have access to the ballot. How are you working to ensure uniformed and overseas voters have access to their ballots during the pandemic? What are your recommendations to uniformed and overseas voters on how best to vote in this election. 
PADILLA: So, appreciate the question. As you know federal law requires ballots for military overseas voters to go out well in advance than the rest of individuals who vote by mail domestically. So we're coming up on that deadline of what we call E45--45 days prior to the election to provide ample time for the ballots to get to the voter who is overseas. 
I mentioned earlier that we are extending the postmark plus three policy in California to postmark plus 17-- 
BUTTERFIELD: --17-- 
PADILLA: --Probably the most generous policy in the nation ow--allowing ample time for the ballots to be returned. That may be something else to consider for a improved national standard because members of our military come from every state in the nation. 
BUTTERFIELD: Sure. Let--let me ask you this. If--if uniformed voters rely heavily on the postal mail to return their ballots what impact did a delayed Postal Service have on the ability of men and women in uniform and their family members to return their ballots on time. 
PADILLA: Yeah. So--you know--we're certainly hoping to properly support and fund the U.S. Postal Service so that members of the military who are serving to defend our democracy and willing to pay the ultimate price for our democracy can participate in our democracy and not be disenfranchised. 
And added tool--I've talked about our ballot tracking system. Where's my ballot in California. Of course every member of the military registered to vote in California can and should subscribe to that to receive those alerts and the confirmation messages when their ballot has been received and counted. 
BUTTERFIELD: Thank you very much. Madam Chair, I yield back. 
LOFGREN: The gentleman yields back. At this point I would recognize for five minutes the gentlelady from Ohio, the chair of the Election Subcommittee, Ms. Fudge. 
FUDGE: Thank you very much again, Madam Chair. Let me just say that I think it's important that people vote the way that they are comfortable voting. If they feel comfortable voting from home they should be allowed to do it. And they should be allowed to do it without having to have a notary or two adult witnesses or some other foolishness that we have in these states. 
Voting is sacred. You talked about John Lewis when we first started. It is sacred. It is Constitutional. And I think that we need to treat it that way and so those who wish to vote from home should be able to. Those who want to vote in-person should be able to. What we have done in our legislation is to say that if things are so dangerous and you cannot vote in-person we want to give you this alternative and we don't want to make it difficult for you. 
We don't want to put any more impediments in your way than we need to. Let me just ask each of you since you all have fortunately have dealt with this for some time. And people like my Secretary of State are hoping for more resources because they're saying well, we can make this easier if we can put postage paid envelopes because people will send them back. But we don't have the money to do that. 
Some of the smaller states are saying we need resources for new equipment because we cannot physically put all of these pieces of paper into a machine at--in--at the kind of speed we need to do it. So tell me do you think--what do you think that it would take to really get all of our states up to speed resource wise? You may not have an exact number but for those who have not been doing this for a long time what do you think it is they will need to be able to do this well? And anyone that wants to answer please feel free to. 
PADILLA: Well I'll--I'll go first if that's okay-- 
FUDGE: --That's fine-- 
PADILLA: --First of all the House of Representatives has already taken a significant step in passing the Heroes Act. Right? It was about $3.6 billion for election modernization and administration. I referenced in my testimony the recent modest appropriations through the CARES Act and the remaining HAVA funds but tho--those are helpful but nowhere near enough. And to really put it in context the last significant federal investments in the election modernization and security was in--after the Florida 2000 election debacle. 
Congress did more in response to butterfly ballots and hanging chads than we've done in funding or policy in response to documented Russian interference in the 2016 election or in preparation for the November 2020 election in the era of COVID. So additional funding and consistent support for elections. 
FUDGE: Thank you. Anyone else? Ms. McReynolds. 
MCREYNOLDS: I--yes, I would add a couple of things. And our organization is working with states on this very topic. We've got for instance operational tools that helps them figure out what quantity of mail ballots they're going to have and then how many staff they need. So there is still a limited window implement things like ballot tracking and also for instance drive up ballot drop off and things like that. And then certainly to plan adequate staffing. So--you know--we want folks to utilize the tools that have been created by non-profit organization like my--like mine to help support election officers. 
And there are other experts in this field that are also working on this very topic. So those things are all happening. Those are gonna continue to happen. And at this point it's really late to order significant equipment because there's just not a way to get that in. But what we do want to make sure is that the applications get processed, the ballots get processed, and that states can--can process things and have timely results. 
The one flag I would finally say is that in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, they--Maryland--they all have policy problems on the books in their state laws that prevent election officials from processing ballots prior to election day. And that is what creates delays. And so those state legislative bodies need to act--and they can still do so now--to enable election officials the ability and the time they need to actually process ballots. 
FUDGE: Thank you. That is something we can do before this election even if we can't get the equipment-- 
GUPTA: --Congresswoman if I could. Oh, if I could also add to that. Can you hear me? Okay. Just--there still is time for states to spend on prepaid postage to your point that you were making earlier. And there's also a necessity as folks have recognized to increase and having young poll workers. Poll workers typically are retirees. We need to make sure that there are enough poll workers and we're doing a lot of poll worker recruitment at the moment. But they need training, they need PPE, and all of that costs money. 
That is--those are resources that if Congress can support we can make sure that there are--and the NGO community and others are working to do this--that there are adequate number of poll workers that will reduce the need to shut down polling places so that we can avoid the kinds of images that we saw in Wisconsin. But all of this costs money. But this is still--there still is very much a window to get this done with additional (INAUDIBLE) around the country. 
LOFGREN: Thank you. The gentlelady's time is expired and unfortunately Mr. Aguilar had to leave so I will recognize myself for my five minutes of questions. I'm gonna return to you Mr. Padilla because I cut you off. The five minutes was up and you were going to explain the California procedures where voters get to decide who to give their ballot to if they--if they don't want to put it in the mail. Can you talk about that. 
PADILLA: Right. So I think the more appropriate term here is--you know--what the policy may or may not be on ballot collection. And so let's put this in context. So California voters were rec--every active registered voter will receive a ballot in the mail by the California schedule early October. You know--29 days prior to the election. That's the last day for counties to send ballots out. 
Voters then have options for how to return the ballot. The easiest is by mail. California's one of the states that covers the return postage so voters don't have to look for stamps in their drawer in the kitchen. If people don't feel comfortable with the Postal Service because of what's been in the news they can deliver their ballot to any secure ballot drop box in--that's convenient to them in the several weeks leading up to the election. 
Voters also have the option of dropping the ballot off in-person if that's their choice at any voting location in their county over the course of several days that in-person voting is being offered. And after all that if--you know--life happens. If you have a sick child or some sort of emergency and you can't get your ballot back personally California law empowers voters to decide for themself who they trust to return their ballot for them. 
It used to be limited to immediate family members in the same household. You know--but--I don't know about you but I trust my neighbor. You know--if we were tied up I'd confidently hand my ballot to my neighbor to return for me if that's what I felt comfortable doing. So that's really what the California law is. Multiple options and voters decide how they choose to return their ballot or who they trust to return their ballot for them if that's their choice. 
LOFGREN: So I--I think it's important--all of us who are watching the North Carolina debacle. And that was--North Carolina does not permit voters to decide who to--you know--that they want their neighbor to take the ballot in. But there was a conspiracy really for political operatives who violated the law. They--they put in false applications for absentee ballots. They destroyed ballots. I mean--and they committed crimes and they were prosecuted and convicted of those crimes. 
I would like to ask this. In California have there been any convictions or arrests for misconduct relative to ballots being handed to somebody other than the Postman? 
PADILLA: The--well--no documented cases from our March 2020 primary but also suggest it is one of the tremendous value added of our ballot tracking system. Voters will have those alerts including confirmation of when their ballot is received and counted. So more transparency and more spotlight on the process is good for election integrity and public confidence. 
LOFGREN: So again, I'd like to say that in the 2018 election we had--you know--both parties had observers. And they were there election day and they were there after election day looking at everything. And there were no complaints filed. You know--there were complaints in North Carolina cause a crime was committed. But not a single election was subject to the very partisan people who are there--you know--cheering on their side. There were--there were no--there was no misconduct. 
So I just think it's important to clear the record on that point. I'd just like to ask this of the election officials here. It is possible to have your vote disqualified. And if your--if your signature's off or you don't sign. What steps and what education efforts should we make so that all the voters who are using a vote-by-mail system have a better chance of their vote actually being counted. Mr. Padilla you want to start. 
PADILLA: Sure. Sure. A little--for purposes of--you know--this upcoming election California voters should know that--you know--if they're voting by mail that signature on the envelope is required. California laws requires counties to contact the voter if there's any issue with that signature, if there's a missing signature or there's a signature mismatch affording that voter an opportunity to correct whatever the issue may be so that their ballot can be counted and their voice heard in the process. 
Of course if it wasn't that voter returning that ballot then there's another issue maybe to look into. In preparation for November to try to avoid these issues, a public information campaign reminding people to sign the back of the envelope. Public information campaign to sign up for the ballot tracking tools. Public education campaign to verify the status of their voter registration. 
And by the way, when a California voter checks their voter registration status--you know--part of the information on that record is the--the determination of their votes in prior election. If they voted provisionally or they voted by mail confirmation that those ballots were received and counted and if not why not. So that would be a flag if their signature issue from a prior election. So a lot of--you know--wrap around assurances that the ballot will be counted. But opportunities for voters to address any issues that they have. 
LOFGREN: My time is expired and I'm gonna call time for me to be fair. I--and really we have al--each had a chance to ask two sets of questions. 
So I would like to ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and that written statements be made part of the record. And also that additional questions may be sent to each of the witnesses and if that occurs we would ask if possible for you to promptly answer those questions. 
I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the following materials. Considering for modifying the scale of in-person voting by the election infrastructure government coordinating council as provided on the election assistance commission's website. Considerations for election polling locations and voters by the Centers for Disease Control. Guidelines for healthy in-person voting by the Brennan Center and ballot drop-box guidance created by the cyber security and infrastructure security agency. And without objection those items are made part of the record. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Madam Chair-- 
LOFGREN: --Yes-- 
RODNEY DAVIS: --I forgot to ask. May I ask unanimous consent to submit a letter from Louisiana Secretary of State, Kyle Ardoin, for the record. 
LOFGREN: Of course. Without u--without objection that is part of the record. 
RODNEY DAVIS: Thank you, ma'am. 
LOFGREN: Seeing no further business be--before us let me thank all--each of the witnesses for taking the time to be with us today. Your testimony was enlightening and it is very much appreciated. And if there's nothing further we will adjourn this hearing with many thanks to all of you and all of the members. "

In recent years, Islamist terrorism has been the main security threat in the world. And, as such, it has received all the attention of governments and the media. In recent years, however, violence has been growing with othersurnames and it is lighting some almost forgotten alarms in security departments: far-right terrorism.
In early October, when the FBI arrested a group of men linked to far-right militias planning to kidnap Michigan State Senator Gretchen Whitmer, many in the U.S., wondered if the threat from these groups had not been underestimated.
Just a few days later, doubts about its importance were resolved in a report by the country's Department of Homeland Security: ""As Secretary, I am concerned about any form of violent extremism ..., however, I am particularly concerned about the violent extremists of white supremacy who have been exceptionally lethal in their abhorrent attacks,"" said Chad Wolf, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security of the United States.
The data presented in the document are blunt: almost 70% of the attacks and plots that the country has suffered in the first eight months of the year are framed in ""white supremacism"", a category framed in the far right. In these attacks, 39 people were killed.
And the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning: this ""white supremacist"" terrorism will remain ""the most persistent and lethal threat in the country"" from now on.

One more rung was German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, whose government has even had to dissolve an elite army unit because of its ties to neo-Nazi groups amid collusions to create a terrorist group within its armed forces. ""It's the biggest threat to us,"" he said.
And the UN Counterterrorism Committee itself has recently been forced to issue an alert against the ""growing transnational threat of far-right terrorism.""
Thus, the different alerts mark a trend: in the last five years, terrorist attacks labelled as far-right have grown by 320%worldwide, according to the Global Terrorism Index, one of the benchmarks in this area and developed by the Institute of Economy and Peace (IEP).
What is fascism and how is it different from the far right?
A threat that is particularly concentrated in the US, Europe and Oceania.
If in 2010 this type of terrorism seemed sleepy, with only five attacks recorded by the agency, almost a decade later that figure climbed to 58 attacks in the year, with 77 people being killed. 
At the end of the decade, there were even more terrorist attacks in the West inspired by the far right than jihadist terrorism (17.2% vs. 6.8%, respectively), according to the report.
""We have a problem and its trend is growing,""warns Cristina Ariza, coordinator on the subject of the International Observatory for Terrorism Studies (IAEA) and an analyst at the Tony Blair Institute of Global Change.
 Nearly 70% of the attacks and plots the US has suffered in the first eight months of the year are framed by ""white supremacism,"" framed in the far right. Rainer Opolka's sculptures were temporarily placed in protest at the rise of far-right aggressions in the German town of Chemnitz. Until the attack by Norwegian Anders Breivik in 2011, the average number of far-right attacks was only 6.5 incidents per year. From that moment on, something awoke in far-right terrorism. A group of Italian far-right supporters pay homage to one of their leaders. However, most far-right members who perform acts of violence do not belong to any established group. Some of the groups in thefar right spread conspiracy messages on the internet, spreading messages that say they are sent to their coronavirus-infected immigrant countries to wipe out Western targets.

The economic crisis or jihadist attacks are some of the reasons that have made the ideas of the far right flourish, which is a suitable breeding ground for violent recruiting to the terrorist cause, experts say.

Getty Images Until the 2011 Norwegian Anders Breivik bombing, the average number of far-right attacks was just 6.5 incidents per year. From that moment on, something awoke in far-right terrorism. Why it's rebounding 
In recent history, politically-based terrorism peaked in the 1970s (nearly 1,700 attacks in the period), abruptly declining and remaining almost gone over the next 30 years, according to the IEP Institute, which catalogues separatist and religious terrorism aside.
He practically only returned to the media front pages with two specific and particularly bloody exceptions: the bombings linked to the far right in the Italian city of Bologna (85 killed) in 1980 and in the US city of Ocklahoma in 1995 (168 deaths).
In the 16 years that followed the latter, the institute estimates that the far right starred in only 6.5 annual incidents on average.
But something changed on 22 July 2011, when Norwegian far-rightist Anders Breivik blew up a bomb in front of an official building in Oslo and then entered a Labour Party youth camp to provoke a massacre. Breivik killed 77 people.
Wolverine's vigilantes, the coronavirus skeptical militia that planned to kidnap a U.S. governor. 
Attacks linked to far-right ideology have intensified since then: Christchurch (New Zealand, 2019), 51 killed; El Paso (USA, 2020), 22 dead; Hanau (Germany, 2020), 9 dead; Pittsburgh (USA, 2018), 11 dead.
The trend is clear to experts and the question arises: why now?

""There is no single answer,"" Ariza explains to BBC Mundo, but in the very variety of motivations and locations of these attacks the keys are hidden.
""The years of economic crisis [after the great recession of 2008] and the resulting political processes themselves that drove radical right-wing political formations, a reaction to the virulence of jihadist terrorism of these years, the feeling of some sectors against migration waves... his reasons are varied,"" he reflects.
""It must be understood that so-called far-right terrorism and the movements themselves close to their ideology, whether violent or not, are very heterogeneous and, therefore, so are the reasons for their exaltation even if they share a common trunk. It is not a perfectly organized and hierarchical terrorism, they act alone on many occasions,"" he says.
In particular, 60% of attacks of this type of terrorism are perpetrated by individuals who do not belong to any group,according to data from the Institute of Economics and Peace.
""It must be understood that far-right groups are no longer limited only to neo-Nazi classics, which admire Hitler and defend white supremacy or anti-Semitism, but new aspects have appeared that are in line with the new populism,"" the researcher warns.

The covid-19 and the far right 
The UN Counter-Terrorism Committee issued an alert recently warning of the massive spread of far-right conspiracy messages that are even serving them to plan and carry out violent actions.
There is a significant number: in just three months, a group of 34 conspiracy portals on covid-19 achieved 80 million interactions on Facebook, the UN alert report notes. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization, seeking to provide truthful information, only got 6.2 million.
Your messages are varied. They want to sow the idea that covid-19 is a tool to get the ""big replacement"",that is, eliminate the white population; they warn of 5G infrastructure as a transmission vehicle, that it is a plan to sink the economy, that infected immigrants are being sent to spread the virus, and even relate it to powers linked to the health sector.
The conspiracy theories about 5G and covid-19 that led to the burning of cell phone masts in the UK
And those messages are being tracked specifically, the UN warns.
Some of these groups are following a tactic they call ""accelerationist,"" which seeks to take advantage of the present crisis to sow chaosand overthrow the system.
For example, the U.S. ""boogaloo"" movement, whose label was mentioned more than 100,000 times on Twitter, according to the international body.
The report warns that these strategies are being successful and increasing the likelihood that more ""individuals will commit to taking the step of violence.""
In fact, concrete plans have already been located, such as ""a far-right terrorist plot"" that sought to blow up a covid-19 patient hospital in Missouri, USA, and which was able to dismantle the FBI.

When on the night of June 17, 2015, Dylann Roof (21-year-old white man) opened fire with an assault rifle and murdered nine faithful from an African Methodist Church congregation in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, many did not understand it as a crime of hatred and not terrorism.
Samuel Sinyangwe, a well-known African-American activist, wrote that night on his Twitter account: ""The terrorist who fired was wearing an Apartheid flag on his jacket. If a Muslim man were to carry an ISIS flag, it would not even pass the security check of a shopping mall.""
Nate Snyder himself, one of barack Obama's administration's anti-terrorism advisers, regretted the decision: ""If there was ever an opportunity to define white extremists as domestic terrorists, that was Dylan Roof's,"" he told The New York Times.
And this decentralized character,the lack of hierarchiesand being solitaryperpetrators makes it difficult to fight it, several experts warn.

Terrorism in this trend has accounted for 746 attacks and 688 killed since 1970,according to the IEP, but numerous experts warn that the numbers of violent acts and victims can be much higher.
The far-right ""is a unique form of political violence with liquid boundaries between hate crime and organized terrorism,""says Daniel Koehler, director of the German Institute for Radicalization and Deradicization.
This causes dysfunctions when legally prosecuting them for these crimes and appearing in statistics as such.
""In many Western countries, [extreme] right violence has been analyzed under the heading of hate crimes"" and perpetrators ""are often prosecuted for various crimes (hatred, murder, possession of weapons) and not terrorism"" simply because it is ""harder, and requires more resources, to prove in court the accusation of forming a terrorist organization, or to engage in an attempted terrorist , compared to the requirements"" sued for the other crimes, established Koehler in an investigation for the International Counterterrorism Centre in The Hague.
Thus, Koehler explains, in Germany alone the number of victims could be double: only 83 official victims of far-right terrorism have appeared since 1990, when the count that could fit for this type of activity is 169, according to various academic analyses.
And according to his estimates of German court reports, there could be more than a thousand violent crimes a year related to the far right.
""It is necessary to end the double standards when dealing with right-wing violence and terrorism compared to other forms of political violence,"" he saysKoehler.
He concludes: ""Not only do victims of far-right violence point to it as hypocrisy, but perpetrators see it as a form of victory if they can get away with it, that is, commit crimes of a terrorist nature without being persecuted for terrorism or labeled as such.""

[*]BARR: Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us at this remote press conference. Over the Constitution Avenue entrance to this building is a Latin inscription that translates, everything is created by law and order. That ancient principle still holds true. Our free society depends on the rule of law, the assurance that ordinary citizens can go about their lives without being subject to arbitrary violence or fear. When then rule of law breaks down, the promise of America does also. Our nation is now confronting two serious challenges to the rule of law. The first is a longstanding one, but was recently crystalized and driven home by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
The video of the police conduct in this episode, as I said before, is harrowing. When you watch it, and imagine that one of your own loved ones was being treated this way, and begging for their lives, it is impossible for any normal human being not to be struck to the heart with horror. This matter is being pursued by both the state and the federal government. The state has filed, already, second degree murder charges against one of the officers, and aiding in abetting charges against the other three officers. As we typically do in cases such as this, the Department of Justice and the FDI is conducting a parallel and independent investigation into possible violations of federal civil rights laws. The president has directed me to spare no effort. We are coordinating our work with the attorney general of Minnesota, and, as a matter of comedy, the Department of Justice typically lets the state go forward with its proceedings first. 
This afternoon, our United States Attorney in Minnesota, and the FBI special agent in charge of our Minneapolis field office, the FBI's field office, will attend a memorial service for Mr. Floyd. Today is a day of mourning, and the day is coming soon, I am confident, when justice will be served. George Floyd's death was not the first of its kind, and it exposes concerns that reach far beyond this particular case. 
While the vast majority of police officers do their job bravely and righteously, it is undeniable that many African Americans lacked confidence in our American criminal justice system. This must change. Our constitution mandates equal protection of the laws and nothing less is acceptable. As the nation's leading federal law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice will do its part. I believe that police chiefs, and law enforcement officials, and leaders around the country are committed to ensuring that racism plays no part in law enforcement, and that everyone receives equal protection of the laws. 
In October 2019, the president established the first Commission on Law Enforcement since the 1960s. And I am meeting with them later this month, and I am talking to law enforcement leaders around the country. And in the weeks and months ahead, we will be working with community leaders to find constructive solutions that Mr. Floyd's death will not have been in vain. We will work hard to bring good out of bad. 
Unfortunately, the aftermath of George Floyd's death has produced a second challenge to the rule of law. While many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have hijacked protests to engage in lawlessness, violent rioting, arson, looting of businesses and public property, assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people, and even the murder of a federal agent. Such senseless acts of anarchy are not exercises of First Amendment rights. They are crimes designed to terrify fellow citizens, and intimidate communities. 
As I told the governors on Monday, we understand the distinction between three different sets of actors here. The large preponderance of those who are protesting are peaceful demonstrators, who are exercising their First Amendment rights. At some demonstrations, however, there are groups that exploit the opportunity to engage in such crimes such as looting. And finally, at some demonstrations, there are extremist agitators who are hijacking the protests to pursue their own separate and violent agenda. We have evidence that Antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a variety of different political persuasions, have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity. And we are also seeing foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence. 
The Department of Justice is working to restore order in the District of Columbia and around the nation. Here in Washington, we are working with the local police, the citizen soldiers of the National Guard, and other federal agencies to provide safety and justice. We have deployed all the major law enforcement components of the department on this mission, including the FBI, the ATF, the DEA, the Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. Marshall Service. Their leaders are with me today, and will be talking shortly. 
I thank all of these leaders and their components for working bravely and professionally to protect the district. I'm pleased to say that especially over the last two nights, the demonstrations, while large, have been peaceful. The justice department is also working closely with our state and local partners to address violent riots around the country. Our federal law enforcement efforts are focused on the violent instigators. Through the FBI, U.S. Attorneys' offices, component field offices, and state and local enforcement. We are receiving real-time intelligence, and we have deployed resources to quell outbreaks of violence in several places. I urge governors and mayors, and other state and local leaders to work closely with the National Guard, and with us. The federal government has thus far made 51 arrests for federal crimes in connection with violent rioting. We will continue to investigate, to make arrests, and to prosecute where warranted. 
When I was Attorney General in 1995--1992, riots broke out in Los Angeles following the acquittal by the state of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Ultimately, the Department of Justice, at my direction, filed federal civil rights charges against those officers. As President Bush assured the nation at that time, quote, ""The violence will end, justice will be served, hope will return."" The same is true today; the rule of law will prevail. Thank you. Now I'd like to introduce my colleague Chris Wray, the Director of the FBI. 
And I have to say, this is the FBI that I've had the pleasure of working with over the last few days, the FBI that I know and love, that have really stood up here and performed magnificently, not only here in DC, but around the country and in all their field offices. And their enforcement functions, their intelligent functions are now in full gear. And I'm confident that with the FBI's leadership, we are going to deal effectively with the criminals who were involved in extremist violence. Chris? 
WRAY: Thank you, General, for your leadership. Good morning. This is, needless to say, an incredibly challenging time for our country, and for all the citizens we serve. I want to begin by expressing by deepest sympathies for George Floyd and his family. Like most of you, I was appalled and profoundly troubled by the video images of the incident that ended with Mr. Floyd's tragic death. Within hours of his death on May 25th, the FBI had opened a criminal investigation to determine whether the actions by the former Minneapolis Police Department officers involved violated federal law. We're moving quickly in that investigation, and we're going to follow the facts wherever they may lead, in our pursuit of justice. 
Mr. Floyd's family, like a lot of families who have lost loved ones in recent weeks, are suffering right now and trying to find a way forward. In fact, our entire country is trying to find a way forward. That's because this is not just about George Floyd, this is about all of those over the years who have been unjustifiably killed, or had their rights violated by people entrusted with their protection. When law enforcement fails to fulfill its most basic duty, to protect and serve its citizens, particularly members of a minority community, it not only tarnishes the badge we all wear, but erodes the trust that so many of us in law enforcement have worked so hard to build. And when people feel that we haven't lived up to the trust that they place in us, it is understandable that they want to speak out in protest. And the FBI holds sacred the rights of individuals to peacefully exercise their First Amendment freedoms. 
Non-violent protests are signs of a healthy democracy, not an ailing one. The FBI's mission is to protect the American people, and uphold that constitution. That mission is both dual and simultaneous, it is not contradictory. In engaging with our communities during these protests, we in law enforcement must balance the safety and security of our communities with our citizens' constitutional rights and civil liberties. One need not and must not come at the expense of the other. 
In recent days, the violence, threat to life, and destruction of property that we've seen in some parts of the country jeopardizes the rights and safety of all citizens, including peaceful demonstrators, and it has to stop. We're seeing people who are exploiting this situation to pursue violent, extremist agendas, anarchists like Antifa, and other agitators. These individuals have set out to sow discord and upheaval rather than join in the righteous pursuit of equality and justice. And by driving us apart, they're undermining the urgent work and constructive engagement of all those who are trying to bring us together; our community and religious leaders, our elected officials, law enforcement and citizens alike. 
Many have suffered from the violence instigated through these radicals and extremists, including members of our own law enforcement family, officers killed or gravely injured while just doing their jobs, fulfilling their duty to the public by trying to keep everyone safe. To be clear, we are not in any way trying to discourage peaceful protestors. And to those citizens who are out there making your voices heard through peaceful, lawful protest, let me say this, we in law enforcement hear you. We have to make sure that our policing and our investigations are conducted with the professionalism and commitment to equal justice that you all deserve. But we are also committed to identifying, investigating, and stopping individuals who are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity. 
So at the FBI, we're focusing our efforts on supporting our law enforcement partners with maintaining public safety in the communities we're all sworn to protect. We're making sure that we're tightly lashed up with our state, local, and federal law enforcement partners across the country by standing up 24-hour command posts in all of our 56 field offices. We've directed our 200 joint terrorism task forces around the country to assist law enforcement with apprehending and charging violent agitators who are hijacking peaceful protests. 
On a national level, we're soliciting tips, leads, and video evidence of criminal activities through our National Threat Operation Center, NTOC. And over the past few days, like the Attorney General, I've been speaking with law enforcement leaders in various parts of the country to ensure that we're providing the support they need, and to let them know that in every community, the FBI stands ready to assist wherever we can. The relationships that we've built with our law enforcement and community partners are more important now than ever. Because the reality is, we can't do our jobs without the trust of the American people. 
I want to close by reiterating that the FBI will remain steadfast in its mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. Protecting civil liberties and civil rights has been part of our mission since the days of the Civil Rights movement. Those investigations are at the heart of what we do for the simple reason that civil liberties and civil rights are at the very heart of who we are as Americans. Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal government largely left protection of civil rights to state and local governments. And it took the Mississippi Burning case and the Civil Rights Act for the federal government and the FBI to get off the sidelines and to begin to fully protect civil rights for all people of color. Since then, we've been working hard to identify and prevent hate crimes, and to investigate abuses of power and authority. Our civil rights cases are among the most important work we do, and that will never change. 
Now, I will repeat today what I've long believed about the men and women of law enforcement. It takes an incredibly special person to willingly put his or her life on the line for a complete stranger. And to get up day, after day, after day and do that is extraordinary. And in these turbulent times, we won't forget the bravery of our law enforcement members who have risked life and safety to protect the public and keep the peace. But the difficulty of that job doesn't diminish the role we play in society, which is to protect and serve all citizens, no matter their race, creed, orientation, or station in life. And when we lose sight of those solemn obligations to the citizens we serve, the protectors can quickly become the oppressors, particularly for communities of color. As law enforcement, we're bound by an oath to serve all member of our community with equal compassion, professionalism, dignity, and respect. The American people should expect nothing less from us. Thank you. 
WASHINGTON: Good morning. I am Donald Washington, Director of the United States Marshals Service. First of all, thank you, Attorney General Barr. Let me begin by specially noting that today marks the first of three days in which the family, the friends, and the loved ones will host memorials to honor the life of George Floyd in Minnesota, North Carolina, and in Texas. On behalf of the men and women of the United States Marshals Service and personally, I extend my deepest sympathy and my heartfelt condolences to the family of George Floyd. 
What started as peaceful protest in Minnesota after the death of Mr. Floyd has morphed into a national emergency, resulting in many injuries to many people, thousands of arrests, along with arson, theft, and vandalism to property in many cities. As of last night, U.S. Marshals report damage and vandalism to 21 federal courthouses, located in 15 states and the District of Columbia. There has been damage and vandalism to many other federal properties. 
The U.S. Marshals Service is assisting other agencies in efforts to address violent disturbances that have occurred in the District of Columbia, and in other cities around the United States. Peaceful protests are good for our country. This right should be respected by all persons, and this right absolutely deserves the full protection of officers of the law. Among our basic functions is the absolute duty to protect people who are exercising constitutional rights. However, rioters, arsonists, thieves, looters, and their protagonists are criminals. They have undermined peaceful and lawful demonstrations and protests. These criminals threaten our basic constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and they must be brough to justice. 
Since the earliest days just after our nation's birth, U.S. Marshals have worked to ensure the rule by making sure that the federal judiciary and the federal judicial process operate unfettered and unintimidated. We have also worked tirelessly over the years to bring thousands and thousands of fugitives to justice and today one of our primary missions is to find and protect endangered children. 
In the last week, U.S. Marshals have coordinated with U.S. attorneys and state, local, and federal partners to protect protestors and to address the criminal acts of others. Deputy U.S. Marshals are assisting with and conducting criminal investigations required by the criminal acts of persons who are instigating and causing violence against persons and property where such acts violate federal laws. 
Working with our local law enforcement partners, we are also securing federal properties threatened by criminal acts and protecting persons from the violent acts of others. I believe strongly that this special mission is important to our democracy. We will protect those who are engaged in lawful prot--protests, but we will arrest those who commit felonies in our presence. 
We are working violent crime warrants and investigating gang activities that incite riots or terrorism. We are assisting and partnering with federal, state, and local authorities consistent with our broad federal jurisdiction. To our local governments and private sector leaders, we know that we are stronger--much stronger when we work together. We will achieve our collective goals of protecting lawful protestors and lawful protests while also enforcing the law. 
I do not pretend even for a moment to speak for the other leaders here, but I am certain that we are--that we all want local leaders to have the confidence and the conviction to request and utilize all available resources to fight violence and to protect our communities. The U.S. Marshall Service is your partner too. 
In summary, the U.S. Marshal Service will continue to perform our many day to day missions and we will also assist our federal, stake, and local--federal, state, and local partners during this emergency. We will work urgently to keep citizens and law enforcers safe. I thank our concerned citizens for their patience and for their continuing support, and I look forward to any questions you might have. Thank you. 
LOMBARDO: Good afternoon. My name is Regina Lombardo, the Acting Director of ATF. For many special agents, one of the proudest moments is when you raise your right hand to take the oath of office to support and defend the United States Constitution. And we take that oath seriously. However, in the moment we don't know exactly what we will be faced with, what challenges we will have to overcome in order to uphold that oath that we took. 
In this moment today, we express our warmest sympathies to the family of George Floyd and acknowledge the pain and suffering for his family. We also have sympathy for those that are suffering across the country. Unfortunately, where our constitutionally protected right to peacefully assemble has sometimes turned to riots and criminal acts, the resulting violence involves crimes of ATF's core mission. Shootings--responding to shootings, burglaries, arsons, bombings, especially destructive devices such as a Molotov cocktail. 
At the request of the Attorney General, ATF has provided every available resource. We have deployed a large number of special agents--our special response team--here in our nation's capital. We have supported the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the United States Secret Service, and the United States Park Police to protect the public, property, and the national landmarks that belong to each and every one of you. 
Our national response teams are here in Washington, D.C. in order to quickly respond the emerging arson incidents. We are working with the D.C. Fire to assess--investigate the seven incendiary fires in the D.C. area caused by criminals including the arson at St. John's Church, the AFL-CIO, the National Park Service Building, and the D.C. Fire district four police department. 
The individual we believe responsible for that fire at the Metro P.D.'s fourth district has been arrested and charged. Our certified fire investigators, chemist, fire engineers, and explosive specialists are working around the clock to support the ongoing safety of operations. Across the country, ATF special agents, industry operations investigators from all 25 of our field divisions are responding to shootings, arsons, bombings, and thefts of federal firearms licensed dealers. 
We are providing investigative support and assistance to all of our local and state partners. ATF has responded to numerous shooting scenes at the disturbances of cities that is actively working with law--local law enforcement. And we are entering those shell casings into our national integrated ballistic information network, NIBIN. 
Our national tracing center is running traces on the recovered firearms, and we are collecting DNA from shell casings and ballistic evidence. Our crime and intelligence centers are collecting valuable intelligence and sharing all of that information in a joint environment. ATF's JTTF representatives are working with the FBI in multiple cities as well as our Department of Justice partners, the U.S. Marshall Service, the DEA, and the--and the Bureau of Prisons. All state and local federal--all law enforcement working in partnership. 
Our special agents and certified fire investigators are tracking and assisting more than 847 arsons, over 76 explosive incidents, and providing valuable technical expertise and intelligence support. Two of our national response teams--our NRT--have been activated and responding to Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. We have developed efficient and effective strategies to triage and quickly assess the scenes even in a unstable environment. 
ATF has also responded to 73 federal firearms license dealers. We have identified many suspects and made arrests and recovered many firearms already. We have responded to assaults and murders of our law enforcement partners. Our team of ATF professionals at our national correlation center and our laboratories and our tracing center are all working day and night to make those arrests. We are on the streets making cases and protecting the American public from violent criminals. 
You do not have to be in law enforcement to know that this is dangerous work. ATF has answered the call. As the Attorney General stated, the most basic function of government is to provide security for the people who live their lives and exercise their rights. And we will meet that responsibility. This is our mission, and we deeply are committed to that mission to protect and serve. Thank you. 
CARVAJAL: Good morning. My name is Michael Carvajal, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Bureau of Prisons staff are federal law enforcement officers who are arf--often called upon to assist during crisis situations within our communities. The Attorney General asked the BOP to request and assist other law enforcement agencies in maintaining order and peace in the District of Columbia. 
BOP crisis management teams are highly trained to deal with various types of emergency situations, including cow--crowd control and civil disturbances. They are experienced in confrontational avoidance and conflict resolution. In the aftermath of the tragic death of George Floyd, it is unfortunate that these services are necessary. On behalf of the BOP and its 36,000 staff, I extend our greatest sympathies to the family for his loss. 
We also respect the rights of the public to express their frustration and grief. We appreciate those who seek to ensure the events surrounding Mr. Floyd's death are never repeated again. It's shameful those voices are being drowned out by those seeking to incite violence and destroy property. I'm proud of the work our staff do every day to keep our institutions safe, and I'm honored that they were called upon to assist our communities. Thank you. 
SHEA: My name is Tim Shea. I'm the acting ddministrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. And I'm honored to represent the brave men and women of the DEA and to share with you the important work our special agents have been performing these last few days. 
But first, I'd like to join the Attorney General and--and take a moment to express my sincere condolences on behalf of myself and--and the men and women of the DEA to the family and friends of George Floyd, as well as to all those who mourns his passing. It was a tragedy for us too in law enforcement. 
The DEA's mission, like all law enforcement partners, is to protect the American people. Before they receive their badge or credentials, every one of our special agents takes an oath to uphold the constitution and the rule of law. And that's exactly what they're doing this week. As is the case with other significant events, our agents have been authorized to respond as needed to violations of federal law. 
And I'm proud of what our agency has done to assist our state and local partners. To ensure that those who wish to peacefully protest may do so in safety and without fear of violence. While these events have been largely peaceful, agitators continue to attempt to sew chaos. We've recovered weapons, we've had rocks thrown at our vehicles. And our agents, along with other law enforcement partners have enduring the continue verbal assaults. 
And during that time, our agents have acted professionally and admirably under these very difficult conditions. DEA special agents are providing security, conducting threat assessments, sharing that information on potential violations of--of federal law in real time. In addition, DEA continues to investigate drug related crimes including the theft of controlled substances from looted pharmacies, which is happening here in the District of Columbia and across the country. 
In the national capital region, approximately our over 150 DEA special agents have partnered with the Metropolitan Police Department at their request and the National Guard to enforce security posts and maintain a sear--a secure perimeter in designated areas. DEA has also provided over 11 mobile response teams--SRT teams--who are prepared to respond to high risk situations and other requests for assistance, including medical services. 
DEA owes much of its success in enforcing our nation's drug laws to the assistance provided by the very federal, state, and local partners that need our help now. Every DEA agent out on the street helps free up one of our local law enforcement counterparts in this--in the case of Washington, the MPD--to carry out their policing functions and protect the public. DEA is committed to providing that support as long as it's needed, requested, and authorized. 
Our country was founded upon basic principles and rights and among--and chief among them is the right of free speech and the right to assemble peacily [sic]. We're supporting those rights, and the peaceful demonstrators, by enduring the--by ensuring their voices can be heard and that those seeking to exploit this situation are held to account. 
BARR: Thank you. And--and with that I'll--I'll open it up to--to questions. 
UNKNOWN: Thank you. To ask a question you may press star with one. One again, ladies and gentlemen, that's star with one to ask a question. 
And today's first question comes from Pete Williams with NBC News. Please go ahead. 
QUESTION: Thank you. Mr. Attorney General, Washington, D.C. has a lot of experience in dealing with large, complex events that include protests like the inauguration or meetings of the world bank. Why did you think it was necessary for you to take command of this, and where does that authority come from? 
BARR: Well, I--I think the--the rioting got going I think on Friday, May 29th. And got worse and worse over the weekend. It culminated or came to a crescendo over the weekend on--on Sunday evening right around the White House on--on H Street on the northern side of Lafayette Park. 
And it was very serious rioting. The Treasury Annex--Treasury Department Annex there was broken into. A historical building on--on Lafayette Park, which is federal property, was burned down. There was a fire set at the historical St. John's Church right there across from the White House. And an old church that goes back to the eighteenth century and is referred to as the Church of Presidents. 
The rioters used crow bars to dig out the pavers at Lafayette Park and use them as projectiles thrown at Secret Service and other federal agents. There were numerous head injuries among the federal personnel whose repon--responsibility is to protect the White House. 
Just to give you an indication--but--from Saturday until today and virtually the--the lion's share of these injuries came over the weekend. There were 114 injuries to law enforcement. Most of those to federal agents and most of those inflicted right around the White House. There were 22 hospitalizations and most of those were serious head injuries or concussions that required monitoring and treatment. 
On Monday, the president asked me to coordinate the various federal law enforcement agencies--not only the multiple department of justice agencies, but also other agencies such as those in--in the Department of Homeland Security. So, we had a coordinated response and worked with the National Guard and also with the D.C. police. 
That morning, we decided that we needed more of a buffer to protect the White House and--and to protect our agents and Secret Service personnel who could be reached by projectiles from H street. I made the decision that we would try to move our perimeter northward by a block to provide this additional protection. 
And later at 2:00 on Monday, I met with all the various law enforcement agencies and we set our tactical plan. And that plan involved moving our--our perimeter a block north to I Street. It was our hope to be able to do that relatively quickly before many demonstrators appeared that day. Unfortunately because of the difficulty in getting appropriate forces--units into place by the time they were able to move our perimeter up to I Street there had been a number--a large number of protestors had assembled on H Street. 
There were projectiles being thrown and the group was becoming increasingly unruly. And the operation to--they were asked three times if they would move back one block. They refused. And we--we proceeded to--to move our perimeter out to I Street. The--it is true that the Metropolitan Police have a lot of experience in dealing with demonstrations. 
But we have a lot of federal pro--this is the federal city. It's the seat of the federal government. Many of the buildings as you know and facilities here and the monuments are the responsibility of the federal government. And the proceedings and process of the federal government take place here. 
And so when you have a large scale civil disturbance that is damaging federal property, threaten--threatening federal property, threatening federal law enforcement officers, threatening the officials in government and their offices and our great monuments, it is the responsibility of the federal government to render that protection. 
QUESTION: Good afternoon, Attorney General Barr. A couple of questions for you if I may. Yesterday the department charged three members of the group or associated with the group Boogaloo, a far-right extremist group known as far-right extremist group. Is it important in your remarks and thought to point out all of the different groups that are involved in this type of violent activity? And then the second question is, do you have any concerns that law enforcement could have perhaps been more surgical in how they operated on Monday? And many of the people who were moved forcibly were peaceful protesters, sir. 
BARR: Well I--I do think it is important to point out the witch's brew that we have of extremist individuals and groups that are involved and that is why in my prepared statement I specifically said in addition to Antifa and other extremist groups like Antifa there were a variety of--of groups and people, a variety of ideological persuasions, so I did make that point. 
The--I am not going to get to specific, but the intelligence being collected by our U.S. attorney's office is particularly integrated by the FBI from multiple different sources is building up. There are some specific cases against individuals, some Antifa-related. A lot of the extremists are involved in egging on violence and participating in violence, providing the means of violence and you know we are pursuing those cases. 
At the same time, there is a lot of--I would also there is a lot of disinformation out there of people posing as different--as members of the different groups so you sometimes have to dig a little deeper to determine exactly what is going on and there are some groups that don't have a particular ideology other than anarchy. There are some groups that want to bring about a civil war, the Boogaloo group that has been on the margin of this as well trying to exacerbate the violence, so we are dealing with as I say a witch's brew of a lot of different extremist organizations. Maybe Chris would have something to--to add to that. 
WRAY: Sure. I mean let me say first as I have said for quite some time and including even my first few months in the job we, the FBI have quite a number of ongoing investigations of violent anarchist extremist including those motivated by an Antifa or Antifa-like ideology and we categorize and treat those as domestic terrorism investigations and are actively pursuing them through our joint terrorism task forces. 
In the course of the current unrest while the majority of the protesters are peaceful there are certainly instigators, agitators and opportunist seeking to exploit these demonstrations to commit violence or rioting and exactly who these people are, who is driving them, what is driving them, what tactics they use varies widely sometimes from city to city, sometimes even from night to night, and we are working with all of our law enforcement partners to gather as much information as we can about that topic and to bring federal charges where appropriate and possible. So we are about the violence, we are not about the ideology, and it doesn't matter what your ideology are--is if you commit violence or rioting or ask that we would consider terrorism we are going to pursue it. 
BARR: The second--the second part of your question Pierre one of the difficulties is that while there are peaceful demonstrators and participants in these protests, it is the--the instigators, those committed to violence basically shield themselves by going among them and carrying out acts of violence, those project--I saw the projectiles on Monday when I was--I went to Lafayette Park to look at the situation and as one of the officials said he pointed out the various knots of people where the projectiles were coming from, and we could see, and it was a lot of demonstrators, and it's--it's--it's hard to know exactly where they are coming from. Frequently these things are thrown from the rear of the--of the demonstration, but we could not continue to protect the federal property involved and protect the safety of our agents with such a tight perimeter, and so our object was to move it out by one block. The next question, please. 
UNKNOWN: Our next question comes from David Spunt with Fox News. Please go ahead. 
QUESTION: Hello, Mr. Attorney General. Yesterday your colleague over at the department of Defense Secretary Esper expressed some regret in the way that things were handled at Lafayette Park, Lafayette Square posing in a picture with President Trump said he wants to stay apolitical, stay out of things. As you mentioned you had this job in 1992, you saw this during the Rodney King riots. 
What--what do you think about politics, and do you believe that you are being too political in this by--by standing in the picture with the President in front of the church? What is your take on this compared to what you know Secretary Esper said? 
BARR: Yeah, I--I don't know what he was conveying there. Obviously, my interest was to carry out these law enforcement functions of the federal government and to protect federal facilities and federal personnel and also to address the rioting that was interfering with the government's function, and that was what we were doing. 
I think the president is head of the executive branch and the chief executive of the nation and should be able to walk outside the White House and walk across the street to the Church of Presidents. I don't necessarily view that as a political act. I think it was entirely appropriate for him to do. 
I did not know that he was going to do that until later in the day after our plans were well underway to--to move the perimeter, so there was no correlation between our--our tactical plan of moving the perimeter out by one block and the president's going over to the church. The president asked members of his cabinet to go over there with him, the two that were present, and I think it was appropriate for us to go over with him. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Mike Balsamo, with the Associated Press. Please go. 
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Attorney General. Can you expand a little bit on your comments that foreign actors are responsible or working to exploit all sides here and do you believe that the organized information effort from a foreign government as you identified you know which countries are responsible for that? And then I have a separate question for Director Carvajal if I could right--right after that. 
BARR: Okay. I might ask Chris if--if he cares to provide a little more detail. I am not sure how much detail we want to get into, but people shouldn't think that countries that are hostile to the United States that their efforts to influence the U.S. or weaken the U.S. or sow discord in the U.S. is something that goes--comes and goes with the election cycle. It is constant. And they are constantly trying to sow discord among our people, and there is a lot of disinformation that circulates that way, and I believe that we have evidence that some of the foreign hackers and--and groups that are associated with foreign governments are focusing in on this particular situation we have here and trying to exacerbate in every way that they can. Unless Chris has something to add, I can turn it over to--yeah. 
WRAY: Not--not a whole lot that I can say here other than to say that it is unfortunately not unusual for foreign actors to choose to try to amplify events in this country to sow divisiveness and discord and in particular through the use of state-associated media from some of those countries but also social media provides a bullhorn or an amplifier to (INAUDIBLE) up more controversy where controversy may already exist and to try to generate upheaval in that regard and those foreign actors should know that we are watching it extremely closely and are prepared to act if necessary. 
BARR: And what is your question for Mr. Carvajal? 
QUESTION: Director can you address some concerns that have been raised the last few days about the BOP specifically that some officers stationed around DC have said that they have been specifically told not to tell people that they work for the federal government and last night we learned an inmate at the MDC in Brooklyn had died after officers used pepper spray on him after he barricaded himself. Do you have concerns there that--that nonlethal force resulted in someone's death? 
CARVAJAL: Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mike, for the question. Let me clarify this. First of all, I not aware of any specific Bureau of Prisons personnel being taught not to identify themselves. What I attribute that to is probably the fact that we normally operate within the confines of our institution, and we don't need to identify ourselves. Most of our identification is institution-specific and probably what it made a whole lot to people in DC. I probably should have done a better job of marking them nationally as the agency. Point is well taken, but I assure you that no one was specifically told in my knowledge not to identify themselves. 
As for your question regarding the incident at MDC Brooklyn, what I can tell you we did do a press release with the information in there. It was as you stated an incident involving a disruptive individual down in a cell. The officers did utilize pepper spray as you say OC, and afterwards the individual unfortunately died. 
What I will tell you is that we immediately referred the--referred the case to the FBI and the Office of Inspector General. I was actually told, notified this morning that the Officer Inspector General is going to take that case, and that is about all I can comment on because the matter is under investigation. 
BARR: Let me just add that the Bureau of Prisons sort(PH) teams are--are used frequently for emergency response in emergency situations and either civil disturbances or hurricanes or other things like that. They are highly trained--they are highly trained units, and in fact, in the Department of Justice we do not really have large numbers of units that are trained to deal with civil disturbances. 
I know a lot of people may be looking back on history think we can call on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of U.S. marshals, and that is simply not the case. Our marshals response force is approximately 100 U.S. marshals, and so historically, when there have been emergencies where we have to respond with people who do have experience in these kinds of emergencies, they are highly trained people. We use what are called sort teams, response teams from the Bureau of Prisons and I could see a number of--now in the federal system we don't wear badges with our name--I mean the agents don't wear badges and their names and stuff like that which many civilian police agents I mean nonfederal police agencies do, and I could--and I could understand why some of these individuals simply wouldn't want to talk to people about who they are if that were--if that, in fact, was the case. I will take the next question. 
UNKNOWN: Our next question comes from Sadie Gurman with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Sadie, your line is open now. 
QUESTION: Can you hear me? 
BARR: Yeah. 
QUESTION: Hi there. Hoping you can explain how exactly you coordinate the National Guard deployment and movement in and around Washington with those various federal law enforcement agencies. Is it you who communicates the orders to them and how does that work? 
BARR: Well, it largely depends who they are supporting at that time. Some of the National Guard were supporting the Metropolitan Police Department, and some of them would be out beyond the White House perimeter working the streets with MPD so they would be tactically attached there. Others we--we asked the National Guard to protect federal monuments, and so a number of the units maybe even I won't speculate a majority but a lot of the units were dispersed around the city to protect federal monuments or particular federal facilities. 
Those that were within the White House area and were part of protecting the White House and Lafayette Park area were--were under the direction of the tactical commanders in that area but in terms of requesting the resources and asking for their assistance that was ultimately my responsibility of ensuring that the National Guard that we needed to support law enforcement and support the district were brought to bear. Next question. 
UNKNOWN: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Katie Benner with New York Times. Please go ahead. 
QUESTION: Hi Mr. Attorney General. Thank you so much for doing this press conference. I have two questions, but the most important this probably I would like to ask you about your thoughts on police abuse of power. Last year at the law enforcement conference you said that such abuse reflected bad apples more than systemic breakdowns, but today you said George Floyd's death is not the first of its kind while the vast majority of officers do their jobs bravely and righteously it is undeniable that many African Americans lack confidence in the criminal justice system. So has your thinking whether we are looking at a systemic issue or not shifted over time? 
BARR: No, my views haven't shifted recently and what I--what you quoted I think is--is consistent, and you were addressing you know the use of excess of force, is that right, Katie? Is that what you were addressing or were you-- 
QUESTION: Yes, excessive force and (INAUDIBLE) abuse, yes. 
BARR: Yeah. I--I do think that--that those who engage in excessive force that involves you know remember federal civil rights laws address willful use of excessive force and those that engage in that kind of activity I think are a distinct minority, and I think the overwhelming number of police officers try conscientiously to--to use appropriate and reasonable force. 
QUESTION: And then my second question was just it seems that we are ratcheting up in the district the tools and the power of the federal response getting DEA, BOP (INAUDIBLE) for example, the power to make arrests. I am wondering why that is happening now because it seems that the streets have been relatively quiet, and there is no curfew tonight, and I think that decision was made by the mayor because she has confidence that we have sort of returned to order. 
BARR: Well, actually after assessing the situation last night toward the end of the evening that is late in--or maybe early in the morning I felt that we--we could afford to collapse our perimeter and eliminate some of the checkpoints and so forth and take a little bit of a more low-profile footprint for a couple of reasons. 
Number one, I think that we have seen a sharp reduction in violent episodes and peaceful demonstrations, and our hope and expectation is that those will continue. And also because we now have on hand sufficient resources, we feel to deal with--with that contingency if violence increases so I--I do think that over the weekend and certainly at the beginning of this week we had a phenomenon around the country with a number of cities getting extremely violent, a lot of officers have been hurt around the country, a lot of victims, a lot of property damage. And as I said on Sunday it was probably the peak of violence in DC and on Monday we were still facing very large demonstrations that were belligerent, and throwing projectiles all of the evening ultimately ended more peaceably. 
So I do as I told the governors on Monday it's very important to use sufficient forces of law enforcement to establish law and order in a city when you have riots running. If you use insufficient resources, it is dangerous for everybody. It is dangerous for the officers, it is dangerous for the protesters, it is dangerous for the population because things can easily get out of control and you lose control of events. That is what riots are, and the way to address it is to make sure that resources are there and that people understand the resources are there to deal with that kind of violence, and I think once that occurred it provided an environment where things could quiet down, and they did quiet down, and hopefully, they will stay quieted down. 
Next? Okay. I think that was it. I appreciate--I appreciate everyone's attendance, and I again want to appreciate the hard work done by all of the men and women in the Department of Justice and the Justice Department components and their leaders. Thank you. "

[*]GRAHAM: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming. We'll get started with our hearing. I want to thank Mr. Comey, James Comey, the former director of the FBI for appearing today before the committee to talk with us about Crossfire Hurricane and anything else the committee would like to speak with him about. 
So give a little brief introduction of why we're here and what we're trying to accomplish. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is a tool that's been around for a very long time for our intelligence community, the FBI, to make sure that when foreign agents, terrorists or agents of a foreign government are in our country, they can be surveilled if they're doing things that are threatening to our national security. 
I think this legislation goes all the way back to the 70s and it's been used a lot. It's been used in terrorist cases when we suspect someone of being a terrorist. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, we have the legal authority to surveil those people. And you can get a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to actually follow an individual around. 
And I would say at least on our side, the FISA system is very much in jeopardy. The Carter Page warrant application is very unnerving. The Crossfire Hurricane, Crossfire Razor investigation I think have really shaken confidence in the system. And my goal as chairman, and this will go into the next Congress no matter who's in charge, Senator Feinstein is that FISA needs to be reauthorized. But right now, without substantial reform, I don't think we could get it reauthorized. And my goal is to understand how the system failed, how it got off the rails and to be able to assure the American people and ourselves that what happened here will not happen again. 
So the Horowitz Report is sort of the basis of what I've been trying to do. Mr. Horowitz is the inspector general at the Department of Justice and he did a deep dive into the FISA warrant applications of Carter Page and he found 17 significant errors and admissions and their committee and his work has found some other things that were pretty disturbing. So we've tried to use the foundational document, the Horowitz Report and I want to thank Mr. Horowitz and his team for their thorough examination of the FISA Carter Page warrant application. 
They found evidence that the primary Russian sub source was a single individual. They found interviews in January and March of the sub source where he basically said the dossier, which was central to getting the warrant against Carter Page was bar talk, hearsay, and quite frankly much worse. We found that the primary sub source, a gentleman named Igor was actually suspected by the FBI of being a Russian agent all the way back to 2009. 
And what happened here is, as a result of this information, the FISA court issued a order rebuking the FBI and Department of Justice conduct. And where is that final paragraph there? This is what the FISA court. ""The FBI is handling of the Carter Page applications as portrayed in the OIG report was antithetical to the heightened duty of candor described above. The FISC expects the government to provide complete and accurate information every filing of the court. Without it, the FISC, the FISA court, cannot properly ensure that the government conducts electronic surveillance, for foreign intelligence purposes only when there is a sufficient factual basis."" 
So we're trying to find out as the committee of oversight at the Department of Justice and the FBI how this happened and to make sure it never happens again. So the basis of our inquiry started with the Horowitz Report an independent agency within the Department of Justice and we're going to look at the FISA rebuke and see if we can find a way to convince the court in the future that this problem has been solved quite--very quickly. 
Carter Page was a--on the Trump campaign team. He was one on the national security team, and here's what we learned. If you had a photo with President Trump, you probably spent more time with President Trump than Carter Page. Carter Page is an interesting character, but the FBI sought a FISA warrant against Carter Page for suspected ties to Russian intelligence operatives. They were unable to get the warrant approved internally just based on contact with Russian operatives. 
Mr. Page denied knowing half the people and there's yet to be any indication that he was lying. And the other group that he was associated with were foreign intelligence operatives of Russia, but he told the FBI early on I was working with the CIA. That's why I knew these people. And the CIA confirmed to the FBI that was true but later on, Mr. Clinesmith doctored the information coming over from the CIA to say that it--Mr. Page was not working with the CIA. 
Why is that important? If the court had known that these contacts had a legitimate purpose, there would have been no basis for the warrant. How would you like in your case for the government to alter a document that was exculpatory to you? And that's what happened and that's their criminal act that's going to continue to be prosecuted, I hope. But during the course between October and June of 26--of October 2016 and June of 2017, the dossier that was central and essential to getting the warrant had so many holes shot through it that it became almost a joke. 
The point is, without the Russian Steele dossier, there would have been no warrant because they tried just based on Russian context. It wasn't until the dossier appears on the scene that they were able to go and get a warrant. The dossier was prepared by a man named Christopher Steele who was hired by Fusion GPS that was being paid by the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign to do opposition research against candidate Trump. 
He had a sub source. We didn't know until now it was a single individual that he hired named Igor and we now know that he or was suspected by the FBI back to 2009 as being a Russian agent/spy, a national security threat to the United States. That's the man that gave all the material to Mr. Steele. 
I will go in pretty deep detail about how the dossier overtime not only became unreliable, it just lost all credibility and the court was never told of the information that was obtained between October and June. The FBI ignored exculpatory evidence, altered documents from the CIA, had interviews where the sub source disavowed the accuracy of the document, and never submitted any of that information to the court. This to me is a stunning failure of the system to work. 
And I will end with this. Warrant applications are non-adversarial. If they are trying to get a warrant against you or your family, there is no lawyer there to protect you. The court has to reply rely on the agents, the department to be honest and forthright when it comes to obtaining a warrant against an American system--citizen criminally or even in the FISA arena. 
So here's the question. What do we do when we find that the warrant application relied upon a document that was fundamentally unsound, that the FBI ignored all of the warning signs about this document, misled the court about the author and the reliability of the document and over and over and over again it was used to keep an investigation of American citizen alive that we now know had 17 irregularities? What do we do? Would you say well that was bad, that's the way it goes? Does anybody get fired? Does anybody go to jail? 
And I'm saying this to my Democratic friends, if it happened to us, it could happen to you. Every American should be worried about this. This is not just an abuse of power against Mr. Page and the Trump campaign, this is a system failure and you could be next. So the joint effort of this committee, in my view, it should be to make sure this never happens again, starting with finding out who did it, who's responsible. 
Apparently, everybody is responsible but nobody is to blame is not the right answer. So my goal is that we can have a deep dive and understand how this happened and working together to assure the American people it never happens again to any political campaign of any party and that the FISA system can survive this very said chapter. We're turning the page on a very dangerous chapter in the history of the FISA program. We're trying to start anew and the only way we can start anew is to find out what happened and hold people accountable. 
We are not prosecutors here. There are people out there who do have prosecute--prosecutorial authority. We'll let them decide what to do independent of us. But it is a responsibility of this committee to try to restore trust in the program that we are we all need and we won't start that endeavor seriously today and continue until we get to the bottom of it. 
I have two documents I'd like to introduce for the record. I have an office of intelligence attorney statement. This is the DOJ lawyer that signed off on the FISA application and the letter says the attorney advises that had he/she been aware of the significant errors and omissions identified by the OIG Inspector General at end of the errors in that Woods process, he/she would not have signed the Carter Page FISA applications. 
The OI attorney further advises that he/she is not aware of any additional errors or omissions in the page by the applications or under Crossfire Hurricane investigation more generally then were--that were not identified in the OIG report. 
This is yet another person saying if I know then what I know now, I wouldn't have signed this report. Horowitz did a really good job. Rosenstein and Sally Yates said to this committee who signed the warrant application. If I knew then what I know now, I would not have signed this application. This is the lawyer that prepared it saying the same thing. Thank you. Senator Feinstein. 
BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Chairman? 
GRAHAM: Yes, sir? 
BLUMENTHAL: May we have copies of that document, please? 
GRAHAM: Yes. We'll submit it to everybody. 
BLUMENTHAL: Yeah thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We are here again today as part of that chairman's examination of Crossfire Hurricane. The FBI's Russia investigation. The president has long that the investigation of his campaign was a witch hunt and a hoax. 
Contrary to the president's claim of a witch hunt, the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz confirmed in a detailed report that the FBI was justified when it opened the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The FBI learned in July of 2016 that the Trump campaign appeared to have advanced knowledge of Russia's plans to release ""thousands of emails"" to harm Hillary Clinton and help Trump. 
The FBI learned this one week after Wikileaks published 20,000 emails that Russia had stolen from the Democratic National Committee's hacked computers. The DNC hack and the possibility that the Trump campaign knew of Russia's plans to interfere in the 2016 election by releasing stolen emails created a significant counterintelligence concern. 
Mr. Comey has said that the FBI ""would have been derelict not to investigate,"" and I agree. Special Counsel Robert Mueller assumed control of Crossfire Hurricane after Mr. Comey was fired by President Trump. Mueller's findings confirmed that the FBI was correct to investigate. Mueller found that the Russian government ""perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and work worked to secure that outcome,"" and that the Trump campaign knew about, welcomed, and ""expected it would benefit electorally from Russia's interference."" 
Mueller also uncovered numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and individuals linked to Russia. For example, Mueller found that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort gave internal polling data and campaign strategy to Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian intelligence officer. The Senate Intelligence Committee, of which I'm a member, recently issued the bipartisan finding that Manafort was ""a grave counterintelligence threat,"" because of his ties to Russian intelligence. 
So think about that for a moment. The president's campaign manager had ties to Russian intelligence and could have used them to share confidential campaign information. Mr. Chairman, of course the FBI should have investigated. Unfortunately, the president and his allies have been trying to rewrite the Russia investigation since the day had concluded. They have seized on errors in the FBI's applications for advisor's surveillance on Carter Page to assert that the entire Russian investigation was corrupt. 
Those errors were serious, but the errors and the so-called Steele dossier, and this is important, played no part in that broader Russia investigation. This was confirmed by Inspector General Horowitz and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who told the committee that none of the Mueller report's findings of criminal charges rely on the Steele dossier. None of them. 
President Trump and his allies also claimed that the Russia investigation was a political witch hunt overseen by investigators who hated the president. But Inspector General Horowitz found no evidence that political bias impacted Crossfire Hurricane and none of the 10 witnesses the committee has interviewed during the chairman's investigation provided such evidence either. We should not ignore or excuse what happened in 2016. 
FBI Director Wray and the intelligence community have warned that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election with the aim of denigrating vice president Biden. We should condemn Russia's current and past interference, not downplay it, and we should insist that the president reject Russia's interference as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Is Mr. Comey--our technology working today? Mr. Comey? Are we going to put him up on the screen? Mr. Comey, could you speak, please? That would actually-- 
COMEY: --Yes, senator. I can hear you. 
GRAHAM: Okay, great. Thank you. Will he be on the screen? 
UNKNOWN: When he talks, he'll come up on the screen. 
GRAHAM: Okay, can you count to 10 for us, please? 
COMEY: Sure. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
GRAHAM: Well, you did your part. I don't--there we go. 11 must have been the magic number. Thank you very much for being with us. Could you raise your right hand, please? Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give this committee is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
COMEY: I do. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. If you'd like to make an opening statement, you may, if you'd like. 
COMEY: I have no opening statement. I'm ready for your questions. 
GRAHAM: Well one, thank you very much and I'll take a little more than five minutes here, but will try to--try to plow through it. Mr. Comey, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the top of the line rate, how would you rank--rate that Crossfire Hurricane investigation in terms of being done thoroughly by the book, and investigation, the FBI should be proud of? 
COMEY: I'm not sure I could apply a number scale, but I would say in the main, it was done by the book, it was appropriate, and it was essential that it be done. 
GRAHAM: Okay. So you're proud of it? 
COMEY: Overall, I'm proud of the work. There are parts of it that are concerning, which I'm sure we'll talk about. But overall, I'm proud of the work. 
GRAHAM: Okay, sounds good. Okay, when did you first learn of the existence of the Steele dossier? 
COMEY: Sometime towards the end of September in 2016. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Do you agree with Mr. Horowitz that the dossier was central and essential to the Carter Page FISA warrant application being approved? 
COMEY: I agree that it was important. I can't tell you whether it was essential. And by that, I mean that it wouldn't have been granted without the Steele information. 
GRAHAM: Well, let's go through the application. There are two parts to the application. Was there an effort to get a warrant approved without using the dossier? 
COMEY: Yes. It my understanding is in that summer, they asked DOJ whether they would support moving forward on a warrant application. 
GRAHAM: And they said no, right? 
COMEY: Correct. That's my understanding from that Horowitz Report. 
GRAHAM: Then you add the dossier. All of a sudden, they say yes to the warrant application. Is that a fair statement? 
COMEY: I think it's fair to say the DOJ decided to move forward after the Steele information was part of it. 
GRAHAM: Yes. So I would say that it was central and essential based on that. So now, here's what I'd like to ask. The contacts between Mr. Page and alleged Russian operatives are one part of the application. Is that correct? 
COMEY: That's my recollection. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Did Mr. Page deny knowing people that you accused him of having contact with? 
COMEY: I don't remember. I think the Horowitz Report says that in the fall of 2016 speaking to an FBI source, he denied knowing certain people, but that's about all I recall. 
GRAHAM: Well, here's the facts. He denied knowing these people and the FBI has yet to find any evidence that he was lying. The people that he did have contact with, did he tell the FBI that he was working for the CIA and that's why he had contacts with these people? 
COMEY: I don't remember that. 
GRAHAM: Do you--do you now agree that the CIA confirmed that Mr. Page was in fact helping them? 
COMEY: I know from the Horowitz Report that the CIA confirmed he was what they call a contact. 
GRAHAM: So the FBI in August of 2016 had information from the CIA informing the FBI that in fact Mr. Page was at resource. Did you not know that? 
COMEY: I did not know of his--the nature of his relationship with the CIA. What I'm telling you, which is what I read in the Horowitz Report. 
GRAHAM: Do you think it would have been fair for the FBI to tell the court that Mr. Page had a reason to be talking to these people because he was working with the CIA? Would that have been a fair thing to tell the court? 
COMEY: I don't agree with your characterization of what Mr. Horowitz found, so-- 
GRAHAM: --No, I'm talking about you as a director. The--the FBI has in its possession in August 2016 information from the CIA confirming what Mr. Page said, that he in fact was assisting the CIA, which explained that contacts. That was never given to the court. Should they have been informed of that? Because that's exculpatory to Mr. Page. 
COMEY: I believe Mr. Horowitz found that they should have at least considered informing the court-- 
GRAHAM: --Should you? You're the director of the FBI. Would you wish that had been done if you had known about it? 
COMEY: I'm sorry, senator, that what had been done? 
GRAHAM: That you had informed the court that Mr. Page was in fact working with the CIA and that explains these contacts. Do you think out of a sense of fairness the court should have been informed of that fact? 
COMEY: Again, I don't agree with your preamble. I don't think that record established that he was working with the CIA. I think Horowitz found he was a contact, which means-- 
GRAHAM: --We've got the--we've got the email from the CIA confirming that he was a source for the CIA. Are you aware of the fact that that email later on was doctored? 
COMEY: Again, I don't accept what you said. I don't think the record establishes he was a source for the CIA. I am aware from the Horowitz Report-- 
GRAHAM: Why--why is Mr. Clinesmith facing criminal indictment? 
COMEY: I only know what I've read in the public record, that he was accused of changing-- 
GRAHAM: --You're the director of the FBI. You didn't know that your own agency had information from the CIA verifying what Mr. Page told you, that these contacts had a basis in fact because he was working with the CIA. Did you know that Mr. Clinesmith doctored the email for it to read that there was no Association between Page and the CIA, that he changed ""there was"" to ""there was not?"" How do you feel about that? 
COMEY: I know nothing about Mr. Clinesmith other than what I've read in the public record-- 
GRAHAM: --How do you feel in general about an FBI lawyer doctoring information exculpatory to somebody being surveilled? 
COMEY: Any false statement over the course of an investigation is deeply concerning-- 
GRAHAM: --But you didn't know anything about that, okay. In October, when the warrant was submitted, the application was submitted, what effort had been made to verify the dossier in October? 
COMEY: I don't know specifically. I know the Counterintelligence Division was working to see how much of it they could rule in and rule out. 
GRAHAM: How much time did they spend ruling in and ruling out regarding the dossier in October? 
COMEY: I do not know. 
GRAHAM: You don't know. You signed the application. Whose job is it to make sure the facts are right when you present them to the FISA court? 
COMEY: Well, at the most basic level, the affiant, whoever is signing the affidavit-- 
GRAHAM: --Did you sign the affidavit? 
COMEY: No. I signed a certification, which is required of the FBI director. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Does the FBI director have any responsibility to make sure the facts are right when they are given to the court? 
COMEY: Not in connection with the certification, but in general, the FBI director is responsible for everything that's being done underneath the FBI director. 
GRAHAM: What we were trying to find is who gave the--who provided the application to the FISA court and why was it so flawed. Can you give me a group of people we can look at to hold accountable for misleading the court? Who would--who should we be looking at? 
COMEY: To understand the process in general and in this case, you would start with the Horowitz Report where you he recounts all that many people involved in the review production, and delivery to the court of this application. 
GRAHAM: But you don't know is the director of the FBI who actually prepared the application. Is that correct? 
COMEY: I do not. 
GRAHAM: Okay. All right, so in October, it's clear, Mr. Comey, there was no effort to verify the dossier before it was given to the court. Do you agree with that? 
COMEY: I don't know the answer to that. 
GRAHAM: Well, that's the answer. And--and in January of 12th, 2017, the warrant application was renewed. Did you sign that? 
COMEY: I signed a certification in connection with I think two (INAUDIBLE), one in January and one three months later. 
GRAHAM: Are you aware of the fact between October and January the FBI had found that the Russian sub source was on the payroll of Mr. Steele, was suspected of being a Russian spy by the FBI all the way back to 2009? 
COMEY: I don't remember learning anything additional about Steele's sources between the-- 
GRAHAM: --How can it be, Mr. director, that the FBI finds in its file that that man that prepared the dossier for Steele was suspected of being a threat to national security and it doesn't make it up to you? 
COMEY: I don't know. I could speculate, but I don't know. I haven't spoken to the people-- 
GRAHAM: --I don't want you to speculate. We'll try to figure this all out ourselves. Do you know who Christopher Steele was? When did you find out who he was? 
COMEY: When the Steele dossier was briefed to me sometime, like I said, I think late September. 
GRAHAM: Were you ever told that he hated Trump and he wanted him to lose and he very much down on Donald Trump as a person? 
COMEY: Not that I recall, at no. 
GRAHAM: You don't remember Bruce Ohr briefing the team about Steele's biases that you have to really watch this guy? 
COMEY: I don't remember Bruce Ohr ever giving the-- 
GRAHAM: --Do you remember a friend late foreign governments putting on notice that he tends to exaggerate and goes off on crusades? Did that make it to you? 
COMEY: I don't recall that. 
GRAHAM: Okay, thank you. All right, so should the court have been informed in a perfect world that the primary sub source was a suspected Russian spy? 
COMEY: At the minimum, they should be--the team at the FBI and Justice should have discussed whether to inform the court about that. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Were you aware that in December 2016, the CIA--CIA tells the FBI they characterized the dossier as Internet rumor? 
COMEY: I don't recall being informed of that. 
GRAHAM: Were you ever told by the CIA to be careful with the dossier and Steele that--that this is not good craft here? 
COMEY: I don't remember being told anything like that. 
GRAHAM: Okay. All right, so let's fast forward now. The warrant application is renewed in April 2017. You signed it in January the 12th. You didn't know that the primary sub source was suspected by the FBI of being a Russian spy all the way back to 2009. You didn't know that the CIA had told the FBI the document is Internet rumor. Are you aware of the fact that the sub source was actually interviewed by the FBI in January of 2017? 
COMEY: I don't remember anything about interviews of this sub source. 
GRAHAM: So as the director of the--was this an important case for the FBI? Or is this kind of a run of the mill thing? 
COMEY: The overarching investigation was very important. The Page slice of it, far less given the scope (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: --Well, I mean, you have a sitting president of the United States by January 2017. You have a dossier that is salacious as hell that accuses the president of being involved in all kind of sex escapades in Russia and a bunch of other stuff and you keep using that document over and over again to get a warrant. 
And here's my question, every time you found information to put the reliability of the dossier in question, you seem--everybody seemed to ignore it and just plowed forward. So I want to know in January were you're not aware of the fact that the FBI interviewed the primary sub source. Is that your testimony? 
COMEY: And I do not remember being told about any interview of-- 
GRAHAM: --Okay, should you have been told about it? 
COMEY: I can't answer that because I wasn't and so I don't know what the considerations were of the team. 
GRAHAM: Well here's--here's what happened. The primary sub source told the FBI in January of 2017 after the dossier had been used twice to get a warrant that the sub source has no idea of some of the language attributed to him came from, that the context never mentioned some of the information attributed to them, and that he did not know the origins of other information that was supposedly from his contacts. 
He said the statements were word of mouth and hearsay, conversations had with friends over beers and were statements made in jest that should be taken with a grain of salt. Did any of that ever get to you? 
COMEY: Not that I recall, no. 
GRAHAM: Do you agree that's pretty important information concerning the reliability of the dossier? 
COMEY: It's information that should be weighed in light of a variety of circumstances. 
GRAHAM: It's inherently exculpatory. The person who put the document together is telling the FBI it's bar talk. It's--it's grain of salt. They tell the FBI and they keep using the same document. You know how they describe to the court the sub source? You know what they told the sub source in the application of the court about the sub source? That he was truthful and cooperative. Do you think those terms to the court, truthful and cooperative fairly reflect the interview the FBI conducted in January and March? 
COMEY: I know the Inspector General found the disclosure was inadequate in that--in that regard. 
GRAHAM: Not only, Mr. Comey, is it inadequate, it is criminally inadequate. You have a document central to getting a warrant against American citizen. It is falling apart. The CIA says its Internet rumor. The person who prepared it was on a jihad against Trump on the payroll of the Democratic Party. The primary sub source was a Russian agent. 
When that person was interviewed by the FBI, he disavowed the reliability to document to the point that it should never have been used again. And my question is how could the system ignore all of that and how could it be used again in April and again in June? Do you know how that's possible? 
COMEY: Again, I'm not going to respond to your preamble. I think Mr. Horowitz found that it was not disclosed in--a variety of facts were not disclosed. He didn't find intentional misconduct, but he found concerning failures to disclose. 
GRAHAM: All I can say is there a duty by the FBI to inform the court of exculpatory information? 
COMEY: There's a heightened duty of candor, which includes exculpatory information on anything that might be relevant to the court's consideration. 
GRAHAM: Do you think it's exculpatory for Mr. Page for the court to know that when he said the people he met with was a result of him being associated working with the CIA, do you think that would have been beneficial to Mr. Page? 
COMEY: Again, because I don't agree with your predicate to the question, I can't answer that. 
GRAHAM: Well, we got emails and I'd be glad to show them to you about the Association between the CIA and Mr. page. Do you think it would be only fair for the court to be told that the primary sub source disavowed the document as being rumor, bar talk, you can take half of it with a grain of salt? Do you think The FBI owed it to the court and Mr. Page to tell the court about the stunning revelations? 
COMEY: I think Mr. Horowitz found, and it seems a reasonable conclusion, that they should have informed-- 
GRAHAM: --How could the director of the FBI not know all of this? How is it possible that the system gathers so much exculpatory information, this Internet rumor, according to the CIA, that the actual interview of the sub source disavows the reliability of the document, that the actual sub source was a suspected Russian spy? How could all that happen and not get up to you, the director of the FBI of one of the most important investigations in the history of the FBI? How is that possible? 
COMEY: I can only speculate because it didn't. And as I said, the investigation overall was incredibly important. The piece you're focused on is obviously important, but a much smaller (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: --Well, it's very important to Mr. Page. It should be important to every American. If you--is there anybody there advocating for Mr. Page during the warrant process? 
COMEY: No, it's an ex parte application, meaning there's only one side represented. 
GRAHAM: I just want to understand this. It's an ex parte event, it means that that cops have a duty to tell the court when they find things beneficial to the person under investigation. And over and over again between October and June, all the information found about the dossier made it less reliable, not more reliable, and you kept using it again and again and again. And the question, was there bias? 
At what point in time do you put two and two together, that the people behind this hated Trump and the reason they ran all these stop signs, they didn't want to take no for an answer? So do you recall getting an inquiry from the CI--I'm sorry, the intelligence community in September 2016 about a concern that the Clinton campaign was going to create a scandal regarding Trump and Russia? 
COMEY: I do not. 
GRAHAM: You don't remember getting a investigatory lead from the intelligence community--hang on a second. If I can find my document here. September the 7th 2016. The U.S. intelligence officials forwarded an investigative referral of FBI--to FBI Director James Comey and direct--Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok regarding U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. president--presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server. You don't remember getting that or being talked--that--that-- 
COMEY: --That doesn't ring any bells with me. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Well, that's a pretty stunning thing that didn't bring a bell. But it did come to you. Let's just end with this. You get this inquiry from the Intelligence Committee to look at the Clinton campaign basically trying to create a distraction accusing Trump of being a Russian agent or a Russian stooge or whatever to distract from her email server problems. 
And how far-fetched is that, Mr. Comey, we now know that the Democratic Party through Fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele, a foreign agent who had a very strong bias against Trump who hired a Russian sub source who the FBI believed to be a Russian spy to compile a dossier that was a bunch of crap to be used against an American citizen working for the Trump campaign? You already knew that. It seems to me you'd want to investigate other allegations, but you're telling me that you don't recall this. 
COMEY: I'm sorry, senator, is there a question? 
GRAHAM: Yes. You don't recall this inquiry I just write about September the 2016? 
COMEY: No. As I said, doesn't--again, I'm--I haven't read any (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GRAHAM: --Do you remember being told-- 
COMEY: --But it doesn't sound familiar. 
GRAHAM: Do--do you remember being told by the investigate--the intelligence community, remember the episode with Trump in the hotel with the hookers and the dossier? 
COMEY: Yes, I remember that portion-- 
GRAHAM: --Okay. That was that was pretty hard to ignore. Do you remember in December the Intelligence Committee basically said a U.S.--U.S. intelligence community report contained information about the falsity of the details of Trump's sexual activity in Moscow and assessed that they were the product of Russian Intelligent Services and filter--infiltrating a source and steals network? 
So this is from the Horowitz Report. In other words, the intelligence community had assessed that the dossier's description of assess a sexual escapade was actually a Russian disinformation campaign. Did you know that when it came out? 
COMEY: I'm not familiar--I'm not familiar with what you're reading from. I don't know whether the incident-- 
GRAHAM: --It's in the Horowitz Report. I guess what I'm saying is that the Horowitz Report has information they had in the file that the whole scenario with Trump in the sexual escapade was Russian disinformation and you knew that and you never told the court. To me, that is something that the court should know. 
If in fact the Russians had infiltrated Steele's sources to create this myth about sexual misconduct of the president, that, to me, it seems to cry out for slowing down and stopping, not keep using the document. All I can say is that you believed it would be a dereliction of duty not to look at Trump Russia. I'm not here to argue that nobody should look. I'm not here to argue that it was somebody other than the Russians who hacked into the DNC. It was the Russians. 
What I'm here to say that there were ample evidence of the other side being involved with Russia to create a scandal around Trump. They hired a foreign agent on the payroll of the Democratic Party who hired a Russian spy to create a document and it was absolutely full of misinformation and complete lies. Did you know there is no Russian consulate in Miami and the dossier mentions that there was one? 
Shouldn't the report have been told that part of the dossier is not reliable? Do you also know then Michael Cohen's adventures in Prague never happened? That dossier asserts that Michael Cohen went to Prague on some venture for Trump in Russia and it never happened. And they know it never happened. 
They had information from a foreign government saying it's not true and they never told the court. They never corrected all the misinformation in the dossier. It was used over and over again and they never told the court about how unreliable it was. Is that a small thing or a big thing? 
COMEY: Any time there are material omissions in application to a judge of any kind, but especially in an ex parte (INAUDIBLE) it's a very important issue. 
GRAHAM: Did you have a duty to look at the--any allegations regarding Clinton and Russia? 
COMEY: I don't know what you mean. 
GRAHAM: Well, you say you had a duty to look at allegations about the Trump campaign being involved with the Russians. You've got a letter at now from Ratcliffe saying that there it was a--they intercepted information about an effort in July where Hillary Clinton approved an effort to link Trump to Russia, the mob. Did you have an investigation to look and see if whether that was true? 
COMEY: I can't answer that. I've read Mr. Ratcliffe's letter, which frankly, I have trouble understanding. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Thank you very much. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The president and his allies argue that the FBI should never have investigated the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. However, Special Counsel Mueller and the spinet Senate Intelligence Committee found that the Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort gave internal polling data and campaign strategy to a Russian intelligence officer. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee issued the bipartisan finding that Manafort was a grave counterintelligence threat. I'd like to put in the record this report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Without objection. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you very much. Would you agree that a direct tie between a presidential campaign manager and a Russian intelligence officer is a grave counterintelligence threat? 
COMEY: Yes. 
FEINSTEIN: Could you tell us why, please? 
COMEY: Because someone who's occupying the role in the heart of American democracy running a campaign is in a position to supply information about that campaign in the workings of our democracy to a foreign adversary. That's the definition of a counterintelligence threat. 
FEINSTEIN: So you would agree that this type of counterintelligence threat does warrant investigation? 
COMEY: Yes, of course. 
FEINSTEIN: The Senate Intelligence Committee determined that Manafort's presence on the campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over and acquire confidential information on the Trump campaign. Does the possibility that Russian intelligence services are exerting influence over presidential campaign create a counterintelligence risk that warrants investigation? 
COMEY: Yes, as the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found last month. 
FEINSTEIN: Correct. Thank you. Special Counsel Mueller found that Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on Trump's behalf during the campaign. Is there a counterintelligence concern when a candidate for political office pursues a lucrative business deal in Russia at the same time he publicly claims to have zero interest in Russia? 
COMEY: Yes, because of the ability that offers to foreign adversary to have leverage over that individual. 
FEINSTEIN: Correct. And does this type of counterintelligence concern warrant investigation? 
COMEY: It--it may depending on what facts you have to predicate the investigation. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you. You told the Inspector General that you received no request from the Biden--the Obama Biden White House to investigate members of the Trump campaign. You've also said that if President Obama or a member of his administration asked the FBI to investigate the Trump campaign, your answer would be not only no, but hell, no. Did President Obama or Vice President Biden ever ask you to investigate a political rival or to go easy on a political rival? 
COMEY: Never. 
FEINSTEIN: Why would that have been problematic? 
COMEY: Because it would compromise the independence of the Justice Department and the FBI's work. If it's a criminal case or a counterintelligence case, it would introduce politics into which it would be a factor of the process. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you. U.S. intelligence has assessed that Russia is using a range of measures to ""Primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden,"" and ""Boost President Trump's candidacy."" FBI Director Wray has said that Russia's anti-Biden efforts have been very active. President Trump has said that he would take damaging information on a political opponent from a foreign adversary and that he would not commit to informing the FBI. 
He publicly asked China to investigate Joe Biden and was impeached for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden as well. Are you concerned that Trump will embrace and use Russian interference efforts to his advantage, excuse me, as he did in 2016? 
COMEY: Well, private citizen now. So as a private citizen, yes. And he said that he would. 
FEINSTEIN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Grassley. 
GRASSLEY: Thank you for your appearance here. On January the 6th 2017, the Obama administration issued its intelligence community assessment on Russian interference and recent elections. That assessment included (INAUDIBLE), which said that the FBI had identified and identified sources relating to the Steele reporting and Russia investigation. 
Prior to that, in December 2016, the FBI had identified Steele's primary sub source and knew that he was a subject of counterintelligence investigation. You either knew or should have known that the primary sub source was subject to counterintelligence investigation when you made efforts to include the Steele dossier in the assessment. Did you make any effort to ensure that NXA (SP) identified that sub sourcing may have been from a suspected Russian spy or otherwise on a--unsubstantiated? If not, why not? 
COMEY: I don't remember any information reaching me about any investigation of a source of Steele's. And I know now from the public record, there was some investigation back in 2009. That can cut both ways, so I don't know how the people working on the investigation thought about it. 
GRASSLEY: Okay. The primary sub source was a suspected Russian spy. The sub source disavowed elements relating to the dossier. He was subject to a counterintelligence investigation and offered people money for classified information. Shouldn't you have investigated the primary sub source instead of Trump, Page, Flynn, Papadopoulos, and whatever else? 
COMEY: I'm not able to answer that question because I don't know the details of the investigation back in 2009. 
GRASSLEY: Okay. Thanks to declassified footnotes from the Inspector General, we know the following. One, the FBI knew that Russians had the intent to target Steele. Two, we see that they had the opportunity to do so by various contacts Steele had with Russian intelligence assets. Three, we see the success of those efforts because some Russian disinformation made its way into the Steele dossier. 
It looks like both the Democratic National Committee and Russian intelligence services manipulated the FBI under your watch. How could the world's premier law enforcement agency miss all of these signs? 
COMEY: I'm sorry, senator. I disagree with a lot of aspects of your preamble, so I can't answer that one. 
GRASSLEY: Well, it sounds to me like you should have known and it's--it's pretty much speaks for itself that maybe you aren't on top of things the way you should have been. Question number four, on February 14th, 2017, you met with the president and he allegedly asked you to let Flynn case go. In any of your meetings with President Trump, did you inform him that the Flynn case was supposed to be closed on January the 4th 2017 and if not, why not? 
COMEY: I don't think I had any conversation with President Trump about Flynn's case except for that February 14th let it go conversation. 
GRASSLEY: Well, if you had that conversation, then couldn't you have informed him that the Flynn case was supposed to be closed on January 4th, 2017? 
COMEY: I don't know why that would be a relevant fact for any conversation about Flynn lying to the FBI. 
GRASSLEY: on January 12, 2017, email to James Clapper, you stated that ""We have concluded that the source crown is reliable."" On January 12, 2017, the FBI received a report outlining in accuracies related to Steele's reporting about Michael Cohen. The report also assessed that the information was part of a Russian disinformation campaign. That same day, you signed a FISA renewal. 
The FBI received another report on February 27th, 2017 that also stated parts of the dossier work falls and it's subject to Russian disinformation. You signed another FISA renewal on April 5th, 2017. Steele is clearly not a reliable source. Why did you say otherwise and why did you approve the finds application in light of the evidence? 
COMEY: What I said about Mr. Steele, you read at the beginning of your preamble was what I believe based on what I had been told and the rest of the report you've listed, I don't remember learning about them or being told about them, so I can't comment on whether they are accurate or not. 
GRASSLEY: Did you ever speak with President Obama or Vice President Biden about any aspect of Crossfire Hurricane? If so, what did you discuss? 
COMEY: I don't remember any discussion. I remember sometime in the summer of 2016, I think August during a meeting in the situation room, I told the president that the FBI was endeavoring to understand whether any Americans were working or associated with the Russian effort to attack the election. I didn't talk about any names, but I believe I alerted him to the general nature of the work. 
GRASSLEY: Did you ever speak with President Obama or Vice President Biden about any aspect of the Flynn case? If so, what did you discuss? 
COMEY: I remember the Flynn investigation coming up once. I think it was January the 5th when President Obama held me back to urge me to do the case in the normal way and to let him know if there was any reason that he should not be sharing sensitive information about Russia with the Trump transition. I assured him that I would keep him informed and I would conduct the investigation in that way. 
GRASSLEY: During the January 5th, 2017 meeting between you, President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Sally Yates and Susan Rice, did you mention that Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador appear--""Appear legit?"" 
COMEY: I don't remember using that word. If I used it, I would have meant authentic and not fabricated. I would not have meant appropriate. But I don't remember using that word. 
GRASSLEY: Okay. My time is up. 
GRAHAM: Senator Leahy, by remote. 
LEAHY: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Are we coming--are we coming through there at the hearing? 
GRAHAM: You're all--you're good. 
LEAHY: Okay. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid listening to this from the beginning that this seems more like a political errand for President Trump's reelection effort than perhaps for some others on the committee. I think it's offensive to all the Americans who pay taxes. I realized the president does not, but the Senate apparently has no time to address but deadly COVID pandemic that's surging again. It has taken more than 200,000 American lives. 
Instead, it seems, Mr. Chairman, your party, Republicans are obsessed with two priorities. First, a bad rush to confirm a Supreme Court nominee on the eve of the presidential election just a few days before the Supreme Court will consider the Republican lawsuit to strip millions of Americans of their health care. And then of course, to once again investigate the investigators who are charged with responding to Russia's brazen attack on our 2016 elections and then candidate Trump's really brazen embrace of that attack. 
I've always thought of this as the Senate Judiciary Committee and I would I've appreciated in my 40 years on it, but I've never thought of it as either the Trump Reelection Committee or any other election committee and we shouldn't be debasing ourselves this way. Now Director Comey, you and I have known each other for a long time. You served our country through both Republican and Democratic administrations. 
I expressed to you some of my strong disagreements with statements decisions you've made as FBI director. I also recognize you were placing truly unprecedented situations. I've never questioned your integrity or your loyalty to the law and to the country. 
Now, whether Vladimir Putin is interfering in our elections or paying bounties to kill our troops or brazenly poisoning dissidents, it seems President Trump is incapable of publicly criticizing him. The Mueller investigation ultimately decided not to look into the financial relationships between the president and Russia, despite some on the team who believe that it would be relevant to the central investigation. 
We now know the President Trump owes more than $400 million in debt to largely unknown sources and in 2014, the president's son said the Trump organization did not rely on American banks for financing. Instead, they received all the funding we need out of Russia. Now, that was a Trump statement. Not anybody else's. 
Now, you stated that you think it's possible The Russians have something over the president. Why do you believe that this is a possibility? Have you ever felt this way about an American president? 
COMEY: I've never felt that way about an American president and I don't know whether the Russians have something over President Trump, but it's difficult to explain his conduct, his statements in any other way, especially his refusal to criticize Vladimir Putin even in public. And so it raises a significant question and obviously the question is always depend by disclosure, if it's true, of significant indebtedness. 
LEAHY: Enough to raise suspicions in your mind based on your experience. Thank you. Now yesterday, reportedly over the objections of career officials, the Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified and released unverified Russian intelligence, likely disinformation about former Secretary Clinton. Information was rejected by the Republican led Senate Intelligence Committee. 
Information was rejected by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Ratcliff--cliff has refused to testify in public on their own intelligence agencies assessment of global threats to the United States, including from Russia. Are you concerned Mr. Comey that intelligence leaders handpicked for their partisan loyalties are weaponizing intelligence by selectively releasing foreign disinformation and withholding credible U.S. intelligence assessments? 
COMEY: I don't understand Mr. Ratcliff's letter well enough to comment. It's confusing, it contains within it a statement I think that it's unverified information. So, I really don't know what he's doing. 
LEAHY: The--the--I see so many of my colleagues on the other side trying to delegitimize the investigation into Russia's documented interference in our 2016 election. We know from our own reporting that Russia is again trying to interfere in our 2020 election. Just this month FBI Director Wray, testified that Russia is very active in its efforts to influence and undermined the 2020 elections. If you had to convey one message to the American people about the persistent threat of Russian interference in our democracy or any important interference; what would it be? 
COMEY: Know that the nation that does not have America's best interests at heart wants to reelect Donald Trump. Let that sink in. Let it guide how you think about the way we ought to conduct ourselves, going forward. 
LEAHY: Thank you. I have a similar feeling. And you over (INAUDIBLE) the former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's lawyer, was pressed by a judge about her communications with the Justice Department of the White House. After initially trying and failing to claim executive privilege, and after making the argument for months that Flynn was not receiving special treatment, she revealed that she has directly talked to President Trump about the case. 
And has asked him not to pardon Flynn. With strong assurance, she also revealed that she talked to a Trump campaign lawyer about the issue, as well, as in part of the Trump reelection effort. Are you the one that supervised this investigation? What does the disclosure mean for all the Trump Administration politicizes its official law enforcement responsibilities? 
COMEY: Well, again, I watched this as a private citizen, read the pleadings in the court case involving former National Security Adviser Flynn, and I think the department's conduct in handling it is deeply concerning. Best summarized by the retired federal judge who briefed the issue for Judge Sullivan in the District of Columbia District Court; it's deeply concerning. Because it's--this guy is getting treated in a way that nobody's ever been treated before. 
LEAHY: Thank you, very much. And I--Mr. Chairman I may have after hearing the other questions of--during this hearing, I may have some questions for the record. 
GRAHAM: Absolutely, Senator Leahy. Senator Cornyn. 
CORNYN: Director Comey, is it appropriate for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to influence a presidential election? 
COMEY: The FBI should do everything it can to avoid having any impact on the election of any kind including a presidential election. 
CORNYN: Are you aware of the allegation against you, that you're handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, your press conference on July the 5th, your subsequent announcement, that based on Anthony Wieners laptop information that you were reopening that investigation in the day--in the run-up to the election? Are you aware of the allegation that you were responsible for Hillary Clinton's defeat? 
COMEY: Yes, I am aware of that allegation. 
CORNYN: Does that concern you? 
COMEY: It concerns me whenever anyone has questions about whether the FBI is conducting itself in a competent, honest, independent way. 
CORNYN: Did you call the Steele dossier salacious and unverified? 
COMEY: I called a portion of it there related to alleged sexual activity, I think that's the term I used to describe that. 
CORNYN: You did not refer to it as unverified? 
COMEY: I think the term salacious unverified. Again, its not all that important but I think I--I reserve that for the sex part of it. The entire dossier was something we were trying to see if we could rule in--rule out. So, the entire thing as to the FBI was un--unreviewed when it came in the door and there was an effort to see what was true and wasn't true. 
CORNYN: Short of Inspector Horowitz's report, are you aware of any verification of the Steele dossier by the FBI? 
COMEY: Sorry senator, I'm not tracking the question, I apologize. 
CORNYN: We got the comprehensive report from Inspector General Horowitz on the Steele dossier, but before the Inspector General's report on the dossier which tells us a lot about what we know now, that we didn't know then, did you know that the information that was reported by Inspector Horowitz that should have raised questions about the reliability of the Steele dossier? 
COMEY: Oh, I see. I'm sorry, yes, I learned a lot about the Steele material and the sub-source interviews from the Horowitz Report, that I didn't know before then. 
CORNYN: Can you rule out the possibility that the Crossfire Hurricane investigation was predicated in part on Russian disinformation? 
COMEY: I think so. I think both of your colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Mueller Report and the Inspector General found it was predicated based on credible information from a friendly foreign nations ambassador. 
CORNYN: So, you're saying even though we know now that the sub source for the Steele investigation or for the Steele dossier was a Russian agent. That doesn't in your view taint any of the basis for that investigation? 
COMEY: First, I think I don't agree with your predication, with respect to the FBI's investigation of the sub source. But the investigation wasn't open based on anything from Steele; it was open based on information from an allied ambassador, about something a Trump foreign policy advisor said in London, about the Russian offer to the campaign of dirt on Hillary Clinton. It wasn't until two months later that the Steele material came to the team. 
CORNYN: The Steele dossier was used to secure a FISA warrant, correct? 
COMEY: Correct. 
CORNYN: Back in January of--after the election, the intelligence community submitted a report intelligence community assessment, do you recall that? 
COMEY: I do. The SDA from January 6th, I think, or the 5th of January. 
CORNYN: I think--I think that's--I think that's right. Do you recall a discussion between you and the CIA about whether the Steele dossier should be included as part of the intelligence community assessment? 
COMEY: I remember some interaction with my fellow leaders of the intelligence community agencies that were part of that assessment. I don't know whether it was over email or on the phone, about how--that we were contributing this material to the effort and how they were going to approach it. 
CORNYN: You don't recall that Director Brennan said it should not be included as part of the ICA because it has not been verified? 
COMEY: I don't know whether it was Brennan--I remember being told that the group's view was it was significant enough and consistent enough with other intelligence, that it ought to be included. But it wasn't sufficiently corroborated to be in the body of the intelligence community assessment. So, they put a brief summary of it in an--in an annex. 
CORNYN: Mr. Comey, you're aware that when we try to reauthorize laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is essential to our ability to protect the national security of the United States; there are members of this body and people on the outside who question whether Congress should have that authority, the intelligence community should have that authority because they think those tools will be abused. Are you familiar generally, with that? 
COMEY: Yes. I participated in those reauthorization debates throughout a lot of my career. 
CORNYN: I know you have. Does it concern you as--at all as a former leader in the intelligence community, as director of the FBI, that the questions that have come up as a result of the Horowitz Inspector General report, the information we know now about the flaws in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation; including the use of the Steele dossier, the inclusion of less than complete and accurate information by an FBI attorney, as part of the predicate for that. 
Does it concern you that the questions that have been raised here will make it harder, perhaps even impossible, for Congress to come together and reauthorize important tools like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act? 
COMEY: Yes, it concerns me even more that the Inspector General found mistakes in every FISA application that he reviewed, well beyond the particular case we've been talking about. So, yes, it concerns me. 
GRAHAM: Senator Durbin. 
DURBIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Comey. Mr. Comey, is personal debt an important consideration when an individual is seeking a security clearance? 
COMEY: Yes. 
DURBIN: Why? 
COMEY: Because a person's financial situation could make them vulnerable to coercion by an adversary. And allow an adversary to do what we try to do to foreign government officials we find are indebted, and that is, recruit them to our side-- 
DURBIN: So, associate--go ahead, I'm sorry-- 
COMEY: So, it's a serious issue in any background review. 
DURBIN: So, someone with substantial personal debt may be vulnerable to influence by a foreign adversary? 
COMEY: Yes, a government official, yep. 
DURBIN: Director Comey it's been publicly reported that President Trump has a debt of over $421 million dollars, personal debt, most of which has to be repaid in the next few years. My source, New York Times September 27th. 
So, as a general matter are there serious risks when someone with hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, personal debt, has access as the president does to all of the countries classified and sensitive information? 
COMEY: It's a serious concern when anyone seeking or with a clearance has that kind of financial vulnerability. I don't know the circumstances, the particulars of the president's case; but in general, yes. 
DURBIN: If the president disclosed his income tax returns, we might be able to know a little more. Let me just say this. This is an important committee, with a great history. I've said that before and I mean it. And I can certainly point to many times in history where the Senate Judiciary Committee was the leading committee, investigative committee when it came to the United States Senate. I think it is entirely appropriate that we are meeting today to discuss Russian influence on American elections. 
I can't think of anything more insidious than Vladimir Putin trying to affect the outcome of the American election and overruling the verdict of democracy by the American people. It is a great issue. It is an important issue. There's one problem. Today, we're focusing on the wrong election. Today, we're focusing on the election of 2016, instead of the election of 2020, the one that is merely five weeks away. 
FBI Director Wray testified earlier this month that Russia is quote ""very active in the 2020 election"". Director Wray said Russia is exerting quote ""malign foreign influence in an effort to hurt the Biden campaign"", direct quote. That would seem to be something that the Senate Judiciary Committee might be interested in. Not only that there's a possibility of interference with the American people voting for president of the United States, but that interference comes from a foreign source, Russia. 
And, they really have their favorite in the race, and their favorite appears to be the incumbent president. And yet, we're not taking a look at that today, we're going back on a trip down memory lane, to four years ago, to decide whether or not certain documents were handled properly. And I will concede the fact, some were not. But let's be honest, if we were doing our job, we'd be talking about the 2020 election, whether American law is adequate to discourage the Russian intervention. 
And what steps we are taking as a nation to protect the integrity of the election process. We are not doing that. Because the agenda here is all about a dossier written five or six years ago. Well, that may be of interest to some, but not to most of the American people. And I think it really comes down to some fundamental questions. 
Why if we are embarking on this escapade into 2016 and what preceded the Russian interference in the election to 2016, why did we decide as a committee on a partisan basis to reject my effort to include subpoenas of Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and so, Russian agent Konstantin Kilimnik? 
If we wanted to know everything about 2016, why wouldn't we subpoena them? But yet, on a partisan roll call, this committee decided not to, not interested, don't wanna get into probing it. We have lots of questions today of Director Comey as to whether he read every document when he read it if he did, what impact it had on him? 
But when it came to these two key witnesses whose names appear over and over and over again, in the Russian interference of the 2016 election; this committee on a partisan roll call, rejected my effort to extend subpoenas to these two individuals. 
Is there some information we don't want to know from those two people? I think there's a lot of questions that have gone unanswered. I also want to make it clear this notion about the Steele dossier, let me ask you this Director Comey, was the Steele dossier the reason that the FBI began looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election? 
COMEY: No. 
DURBIN: Are you aware Director Comey that none, not one, of the 37 indictments and 199 criminal counts resulting from the Mueller investigation relied on the Steele dossier? 
COMEY: I had read that. 
DURBIN: I think that makes the case that all of this attention on the Steele dossier is fascinating as that document may be, it did not have direct relevance on a conclusion that the Russians were interfering in the 2016 election or the indictments that followed, from the Mueller investigation. 
GRAHAM: (INAUDIBLE) thank you, I'm sorry. 
DURBIN: Is my time up? 
GRAHAM: No. 
DURBIN: Oh, thank you. Let me ask you, if I might, on a statement made by the attorney general. Let's see if I can find this to be sure I got this accurately. On May 18th, Attorney General Barr gave a quote at the Department of Justice press conference. He said what happened to the President in the 2016 election and throughout the first two years of his administration was abhorrent. It was a grave injustice. It was unprecedented in American history. 
The attorney general went on to say the law enforcement and intelligence apparatus of this country were involved in advancing a quote, ""false and utterly baseless Russian collusion narrative against the President"", end of quote. Then he went on to say the proper investigative and prosecutive standard--prosecutive standards of the Department of Justice were abused in my view, in order to reach a particular result. 
Director Comey, would you comment on those--that statement made by Attorney General Barr about the men and women in the Justice Department? 
COMEY: He says that a lot, I have no idea what on earth he's talking about. This was an investigation. It was appropriately predicated and opened, that had to be opened. And it was in the main conducted in the right way, picked up by the special counsel. 
It led to the indictment of dozens of people and a finding by your colleagues in the Senate that the head of Trump's campaign was a grave counterintelligence threat to the United States of America, 'cause he was funneling information to a known Russian intelligence officer. The notion that the attorney general believes that was an illegitimate endeavor to investigate that, mystifies me. 
DURBIN: Thank you, Director Comey. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, if I could just respond a bit to what Senator Durbin said about the committee. I'm not here to suggest that the Russians did not interfere in the 2016 election, they did. Would they try to interfere in 2020? They would; they are. Is China trying to interfere? Yes. So, we've had briefings about this. I'm very concerned about it. 
But what brought us here today is that I supported legislation with my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and your side of the aisle, to make sure Mr. Mueller could do his job, without political interference. Well, after two and a half years and $25 million and 60 FBI agents, that job is done. Not one person has been charged with colluding with the Russians in the Trump world, not one. 
Now, when we look into the work product, and I've asked Mr. Mueller to come and tell us about the Mueller investigation, he has chosen not to come. If you want Mr. Weissman to come, I would invite him. The committee is trying to save the FISA system. The FISA warrant applications are against Carter Page, should make every American concerned about how off the rails this system got. 
That the document necessary to get the warrant against an American citizen, the key document, was prepared by somebody on the Democratic payroll, who hired a Russian suspected spy, and all the information in the dossier fell apart over time. And, the court was never informed of the exculpatory evidence that was coming in. 
And, what astounds me the most is that the director of the FBI in charge of this investigation, involving a sitting president, is completely clueless about any of the information obtained by his agency to throw suspicion over the document, that the sub source was a suspected Russian agent. 
That when he was interviewed, he said it was all bar talk, hearsay, should be taken with a grain of salt. That the CIA told the FBI in December this is Internet rumor, none of that made it to the court. None of that. And he didn't know any of it. How is it possible that an investigation at this level, that none of this information that's damning to the case against Mr. Page, never makes it to the top? 
And, you want us to reauthorize this program, with a system like that? Everybody's responsible but nobody's responsible. Somebody needs to be responsible for misleading the court. Excluding information to the court that was exculpatory, that would have mattered. How would you like your client to be treated like this? 
So, my point is, I am trying my best to understand how the warrant application failed so many times, how the court was abused over months, and nobody seems to be as concerned about it as I am? Well, count me in about being concerned about Russian interference in 2016 and 2020, but if this committee does nothing else, it is up to us to find out how it got off the rails. How an FBI lawyer could doctor a document that was exculpatory to the--to the subject of the investigation? 
Be charged with a crime; how could that happen? Is there's no checks and balances in the FISA process? Is there no duty to be candid with the court, when you find something that is exculpatory? How do you present a document full of information, there is no consulate, Russian consulate in Miami? 
You had information, the whole sexual escapade thing, was Russian disinformation and it never made it to the court. How are we supposed to trust this system, without fundamentally changing it and holding people accountable? One last question to you Director Comey, then I'll turn it over to Senator Lee. Knowing then what you know now, about all the things that we've come to find, would you have still signed the warrant application against Carter Page, in October, January, and April? 
COMEY: No, I would want a much more complete understanding of what we were-- 
GRAHAM: Thank you, very much. Senator Lee. 
WHITEHOUSE: You know, Mr. Chairman, it's a technical--technical thing, but when you speak over the witness, your voice blocks out what the witness said. So, we don't know what the witness said. 
GRAHAM: Okay, I'm sorry. 
WHITEHOUSE: So, I think it would be helpful if you allowed the witness to complete his answer-- 
GRAHAM: Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah. 
WHITEHOUSE: in--in a regular hearing, with the witness here-- 
GRAHAM: Okay-- 
WHITEHOUSE: We can hear what the witnesses is saying, and the stenographer can put it down- 
GRAHAM: Could you repeat your answer? Fair enough, fair enough. 
WHITEHOUSE: You block him out as soon as you talk over him-- 
GRAHAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry-- 
WHITEHOUSE: So, if you could let him finish. 
GRAHAM: I'm sorry, repeat your answer. I'm sorry. 
COMEY: My answer was no, not without a much fuller discussion of how they were thinking about their disclosure obligations to the court. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. 
LEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an issue that's concerned me for a long time. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has some problems. Those problems have been on live display, today. They've been on live display over the last few years. I've been working over the last decade to try to reform them. I forced a number of bipartisan appros--proposals to do precisely that. 
Most recently, with the Lee-Leahy Amendment. One that passed the Senate that would have passed the House, but the vote for it was--was canceled. I hope still to get that passed. It is a dangerous thing to provide enormous investigative power of the United States government with as much authority as it has and then to put that in a private secret set of proceedings. These have worried me for a long time. 
We've got to reform them. I remember Mr. Comey when you were first nominated to be the FBI director. I had been in the Senate for a few years by then. I hadn't had a lot of previous interactions with you, but I knew you. And I felt I knew you well. I remembered fondly, some interaction I had with you as a young prosecutor. You visited the U.S. Attorney's Office in Salt Lake City, and you gave us a really encouraging speech in which you give your heartfelt sentiments about what it means to be an Assistant United States Attorney. 
I remember specifically, your admonition that it's important in a job like that, where you have to see things that as you put it people shouldn't have to see. It's important to love someone, it's important to dot your I's and cross your T's. And, I remember something inspiring you said, you said if somebody woke me up, at the time you were serving either as the deputy attorney general or the head of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, I'm not sure which. 
You said in the middle of the night if someone woke me up and they would say, who are you? I would identify myself as an assistant United States attorney because deep down, that's who I am. That inspired in me, for many years, a level of commitment when representing the United States government, to make sure that I was thorough. And you inspired me. 
For that reason when you were nominated to the position of--of FBI director, even though I had some grave concerns with the FBI and how it was administering FISA at the time, I trusted you. I believed that you would act in good faith when I asked you in my office and later in committee hearings. First in your confirmation hearing and then in all of our subsequent oversight hearings. What you would do to help make sure that the FISA process was respected and not manipulated? 
You gave me your word. And, having established that brief relationship with you, all those years earlier, I trusted you. I have to say today, I'm very disappointed, to see that those promises announced to me seem very insincere. 
Now, Mr. Comey, with all the respect you don't seem to know anything about an investigation that you ran. So, so, how can you now as a private citizen and former FBI director, show up and then speculate freely or regarding any alleged ties between President Putin and President Trump? 
I heard you say just a moment ago; now I hope I misunderstood you. Please correct me if I did. I think I heard you say that you speculate--still speculate they might have something on President Trump, because of how President Trump refers or doesn't refer to President Putin, in public. But this, of course, it takes into account nothing, about the fact that sources he relied on in the past have turned out not to be accurate. 
You didn't identify the inaccuracies subsequently to the FISA court. It acknowledges nothing about the fact that there are perfectly reasonable explanations as to why one leader would refer to a foreign leader in a certain tone, or the fact that this is the same tone that he uses in referring to other world leaders. 
Particularly, those world leaders in parts of the country where we've had some issues. So, so, honestly, how can you as a private citizen now come to us and in your capacity as former FBI Director and speculate so freely, regarding these alleged ties; when you don't seem to know anything about this investigation that you ran? 
COMEY: I'm sorry senator, I can as a private citizen because I have eyes and ears. And, I've said in response to the question that's how it struck me, watching the president in Helsinki, take Putin's side against his own intelligence community. And lots of stuff like that. So, I separate the two. I agree with you, there are serious reasons to worry about the FISA process when the Inspector General found errors in every FISA application. And that's a really important thing to dig into, and I respect this committee looking at it. So, that is what I think about those two things. 
LEE: Okay, okay. I'm glad--glad to hear that we share that in common; that's something we can build on. That's fantastic. Why--why do you not think that you had a duty to provide all the information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court? I mean, you signed the renewal application, did you not? 
COMEY: I signed a certification which is very narrow that-- 
LEE: Got it. What does that mean? What the heck does the--the--the certifications mean? If you weren't required to know, and in fact did not know, what was in there. And, if you--it didn't have any duty to provide all the information to the court, what does this certification mean? 
COMEY: Well, I was trying to say senator when you start speaking again, the certification is narrow, that the FBI Director has to sign. But that doesn't change the fact that the FBI has a duty of candor, heightened candor, to the FISA court. And it wasn't met according to the Inspector General here. 
That's a separate question from whether the FBI director should have been briefed on the individual portions of the Carter Page investigation. I know people care about that. Much more important, why were there material omissions? Not just in this application, but in all the applications, that the Inspector General looked at? So, I think that's a really important question. 
LEE: Okay. We have to remember that the only reason the people who did this I'm confident, that number one, the circumstantial evidence suggests that there likely was a political motive. In fact, one of the reasons that we know that is that, in various documents that we've obtained, we can see political motives coming into consideration. But in many instances, those individuals didn't believe they had any chance of getting caught. 
They believed Hillary Clinton was going to win. Had she won, in all probability none of this would have come to light. How should this strike the American people, the average American citizen, knowing that any American citizen could get caught into the same type of trap? Could get--become the subject of an investigation rooted in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It would never come to light. 
If in this circumstance, where there was always a possibility that it would come to light, and it didn't come to light; because the individual who was connected to the investigation became elected president of the United States, despite the best efforts or perhaps the expectations of those conducting in the investigation. How should they have any confidence in the FISA process when certifications were provided but the full information wasn't? 
When the duty of candor to the court wasn't met? When no one seems to take accountability for anything, and this entire process is handled in secret, with a malleable standard leaving it almost without accountability? Should the American people have any confidence in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or in those government lawyers appearing before it? 
COMEY: I'm not going to address your long preamble, which I have a significant disagreement with. The American people should always want to know how the government's power is being used. Especially, when it's being used in secret. How is it checked? How is it overseen? 
How is it balanced? And, we know, 'cause you've been around a long time too, that periodically we discover problems in any ex parte process. The American people should have confidence in the oversight of the Inspector General. Especially, and of this committee and your counterparts in the House, to demand those answers. I think that's totally appropriate. 
LEE: Okay. Mr. Chairman, I see my time's expired. You don't install a wasp nest in your child's bedroom and then express(PH) surprise when the child gets bitten by wasps-- 
UNKNOWN: Stung. 
LEE: You don't adopt an ex parte process and then express surprise and outrage, when it goes completely unsupervised and off the rails. This is an issue that is neither Republican nor Democratic. It's neither liberal nor conservative; this is a constitutional issue. This is a moral issue and we've got big problems. We need to pass the Lee-Leahy amendment, and we need to reform or eliminate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Senator Whitehouse. 
WHITEHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am particularly sensitive to the problem of selective declassification because I had to go through being on the receiving end of a lot of selective declassification, during the Intelligence Committee's investigation of the torture program. And I will tell you it is extremely frustrating to have information declassified in that case, out of the White House, that you know can be exploded, completely blown up, by other information. 
But that other information hasn't been declassified. So, you can't answer the false implication from selectively declassified information. So, from that background, I am really concerned that we are treating this Ratcliffe letter as something at all serious or credible. And, Mr. Chairman, I hope very much that nobody from this committee had any hand in generating this letter. We are recipients only, I hope. Because if we had any hand in this, that's a real problem. 
I will point out that with respect to allegation--bullet one, talking about tying Trump to Putin and the Russians hacking of the Democratic National Committee, that's actually an established fact. With respect to the point about a proposal from a foreign policy adviser claiming interference by Russian security services, that is an established fact. And, the U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering U.S. elections, is also an established fact. 
So, what else do you have around here is what looks like just something that got spun up by a political appointee, and is now being offered through this committee, as having any credibility. And I think that it's--this rings just innumerable bells about the dangers of selective declassification. So, there's topic one. I've got a problem with selective declassification in our proceedings here. 
Second, I've got a big problem with access to documents; you and I have talked about this. You know that I've made public statements about how the FBI appears to have had a policy, for damn sure a pattern, of refusing to answer questions, refusing to answer QFRs. And many cases to Republican Senators, but for sure to Democrat Senators. You took that claim seriously enough, that you organized a meeting for me with the deputy attorney general to explain this policy or this pattern of not answering questions. 
That was on June 15th, as I recall. And, here we are nearly in October, and do you know how many answers I've gotten since that meeting? Zero. None. Not a single one. So, when it comes to our questions, it looks like it's a total stonewall. In this case, on this matter, the DOJ has given the chairman unprecedented access to information; including deliberative documents, stuff that they wouldn't give us, even if they were answering our questions. And classified information, which usually is a mare's nest to get through. 
Eighteen separate productions and highly sensitive documents totaling 1550 pages. So, this particular question seems to be getting high speed, special treatment, out of DOJ; when in other areas we get a complete wall of silence and shut down. And, the last is I'm told that they were even private briefings to Republicans only, on this matter, in which Democrats were not invited to participate. 
Again, if that is true, a combination of selective declassification, dishonorable and unfair access to documents, and partisan private briefings does not get us off to a good start, going back to my letter to you of June 4th, about the hazards of this investigation. So, I just needed to say that. I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that it is worth looking into the question of what is wrong with the FISA process, that allowed these repeated errors to happen, across a whole array of cases? 
But it's also interesting to read the Gleason brief, where a retired federal judge on behalf of a federal judge, accused the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Barr of running political errands for the president, in order to protect a political supporter and friend of his, Mr. Flynn. And, we have exactly zero attention being paid to that. That is a fairly serious matter of interest. I think, equivalent to the matter of interest in FISA. But nothing. 
The current FBI director is talking about present Russian interference in this election, right now as we speak, to try to get President Trump re-elected. Where's the hearing on that? Where are the documents on that? Where's the declassified material on that? None of it. And, you know, I'll go back to the--what I considered because I don't have any information 'cause the FBI is giving me none, what appears to have been a bogus tip line, in the Kavanaugh investigation. 
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't? But a question about whether that was a bogus tip line, I think is something that is worth answering. And yes, it is important that the FISA process was abused, but if an FBI investigation was abused, in the Kavanaugh hearings, that's also an important matter. So, I don't want to deprecate the importance of what we're doing here. 
But I do think it stands in a very sharp contrast to other issues with the FBI that are continually swept under the rug and continually stonewalled. The question that I have and is something I've raised before and I'll ask Director Comey, 'cause he's done a lot of investigations. 
You and I have done investigations as well, chairman, you've been a prosecutor. If you have an investigation and if you determine as an over--in your oversight, as a supervisor, that there is a flaw or an omission or a false statement in a warrant application; obviously, you should not file that warrant application with the court. 
The problem is that the committee's questions on the republican side have always ended there. You would not sign a warrant if you knew that were the case. The problem with that is that you then go on to the next step and that is just because there was a flaw in a proposed warrant, doesn't mean you end the investigation. You're nodding your head, we both agree. 
At the end of the day, what you then do is you go back and you look at whether the investigation was otherwise predicated, with all the falsity or whatever removed, and everything accurate that needs to be in there done. And, if then, the investigation was otherwise predicated and if then, there was otherwise probable cause to continue; Director Comey, do you not then proceed with the investigation with a cleaned-up warrant? Rather than, let somebody get off scot-free because of an error that never reached the court? 
COMEY: You would certainly want to go through, I think that's called the Franks Process, to understand whether you still have sufficient basis to establish probable cause with the mistakes and omissions corrected. 
WHITEHOUSE: And, that is standard FBI practice, correct? 
COMEY: That's a standard prosecutorial investigative practice across the nation. 
WHITEHOUSE: Across the board. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Hey, I'll respond and turn it over to Senator Cruz. Number one, Senator Whitehouse has reason to be concerned about some testimony given in the House by a Department of Justice official about environmental policy. And we will keep plugging away with me and you and Senator Leahy, 'cause it's a legitimate inquiry-- 
WHITEHOUSE: Just to be clear, chairman. Yes, I'm very concerned about the antitrust-- 
GRAHAM: Right. 
WHITEHOUSE: Investigation and who was behind it-- 
GRAHAM: Yes. 
WHITEHOUSE: And, why it seemed to violate so many rules and norms-- 
GRAHAM: Yes, yes. 
WHITEHOUSE: And when we get around to Senator Leahy and Senator Klobuchar's antitrust investigation, which was supposed to be today but has been I gather indefinitely postponed. I would hope that we have those documents. but the list that I gave to deputy--to the deputy attorney general, of all of the QFR's that I've not had answers to and of all of the questions and letters I've not had answers to, goes well beyond that one issue of the Delrahim investigation, of fake investigation and-- 
GRAHAM: Right. 
WHITEHOUSE: And would seem, but we'll see, of the auto companies. 
GRAHAM: Yeah. And just to make it clear to the public, at large because the Carter Page warrant application was incredibly flawed, doesn't mean you can't look at other things. The question for me is always been okay, let's look at all things Trump. And, the dossier the accused Carter Page as having a relationship with Manafort and that's where he's passing all this information. 
Carter Page never talked to Manafort, as things that the court should know; allegations being made. We now know that the dossier was a result, at least in part, of Russian disinformation. That the FBI took Russian disinformation, from a political party, paid for by a political party, and got a warrant against an American citizen; now, that's pretty stunning. And, we gotta do something. Somebody needs to go to jail or get fired over that. 
Now, the question is always been, did the FBI have the same zeal looking at Trump? Let's put it this way, everything Trump got looked at, people's lives were turned upside down, $25 million was spent and nobody's ever been charged with colluding with the Russians, on the Trump side. Where there--was there any suggestion maybe the other siders was involved in trying to create a Russian-Trump problem for political purposes? 
We know that Christopher Steele was on the payroll of the Democratic Party. We know that he was working for shoot--Fusion GPS. We know that his primary sub-source was Igor the Russian spy. If they were willing to do that, would they be willing to do more? We know in July, there's an intercept out there from Russian intelligence analysts, that the Clinton campaign is concocting a strategy to tie Trump to Russia. 
All I'm suggesting is, did they look at that? And, Director Comey has told me he doesn't remember getting inquired from the intelligence community about a September concern, about the Clinton campaign trying to change the subject from the server to Trump-Russia. He doesn't remember that? So, what kind of system do we have? 
We look at all things Trump, all the time. And, when we get exculpatory evidence, we keep looking. When we're told is not reliable, we keep using it. And, when there's suggestions at the other side may be up to no good, we just ignore it. That's why the Ratcliffe information is important to me. I haven't been privately briefed by anybody. But I'm beginning to understand there was a two-tiered system here. 
When it came to Trump, there were no rules, plow ahead, ignore everything, lie if you need to, alter documents. When it came to Clinton, seems to be a completely different standard, knowing that the campaign had on its payroll, a foreign agent, who hired a Russian spy, to get dirt on Trump. That is the concern I have. And we can't live in a world where you turned the world upside down against one campaign and give the other campaign pretty much a complete pass regarding Russia. 
WHITEHOUSE: Senator--chairman since you've responded to me, may I have a moment back to you? 
GRAHAM: Yes, you may. 
WHITEHOUSE: I'll be brief. The only thing I will say is that if you look at the Ratcliffe letter the only thing that it really says is that if it's to be believed at all, there was a plan within the Clinton campaign, to point out that Trump and the Russians were scheming in the election, or the Trump campaign and the Russians, were scheming in the election. 
GRAHAM: Okay, great. 
WHITEHOUSE: So, that predicated fact seems actually to be established truth, if you believe the SSCI report and if you believe what Director Wray is saying right now, and what the FBI has said all along. So, it's really hard to call a campaigns effort to blow the whistle on the other side's communications with Russia, and Russia's efforts to support that candidate, with the actual efforts to--to do that. And, I mean, they're not the same thing. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. I have a completely different view of what this-- 
WHITEHOUSE: Okay, but you had a chance to say yours, you gave me the same, and I'm grateful to you-- 
GRAHAM: No, that's fair, it's all fair-- 
WHITEHOUSE: I'll yield back. And, I thank you for that courtesy. 
GRAHAM: I--all I know is that the CIA felt Obama needed to know about this and I take it completely different, that this was an effort by the Clinton campaign to tie Trump to Russia, not because of anything they found because that was part of their political strategy. Senator Lee, you want to say something? 
LEE: Since the Anti-Trust Subcommittee was brought up, I just wanted to respond to that point. As you know Senator Whitehouse, we had originally scheduled the oversight hearing for today. Because of this conflict with this hearing today, that couldn't occur. I've been in constant contact with assistant attorney general, Makin Delrahim, who is an outstanding lawyer. One that I've known for twenty years and who I trust. 
Now, I know you and I perhaps see that differently. Makin Delrahim is eager, not only willing but eager to come and testify, to set the record straight, again on these issues. He has in fact responded to your letter. I don't know whether you've read that response yet or not? He also told me last night I believe there are more documents that he's either just sent you or about to send you. 
I'd like to know, you know, instead of just smearing him by saying that he's being evasive; tell me what questions you've asked that he hasn't answered. To my knowledge, he has responded to you. You may not like his responses but-- 
WHITEHOUSE: I'll get--I'll get you the list-- 
LEE: Please do. 
GRAHAM: Yeah, yeah, can we, yeah, well we'll will resolve this but-- 
WHITEHOUSE: I gave a list to the chairman some time ago and I assumed that would be passed on to you. 
GRAHAM: And, I support Senator Whitehouse's efforts to have this hearing. 
WHITEHOUSE: I think it's important that we do this. I don't want to be in a situation in which he comes in and I don't have the chance to do the preparation for a meaningful hearing. 
GRAHAM: Yeah, I totally get that-- 
KLOBUCHAR: Mr. Chair, maybe you can help us get this hearing, about being the ranking on that subcommittee, because I was willing to do it tomorrow. I'd be willing to do it any day next week. It looks like we're going to be back. I will be back both Senator Whitehouse and I are going to be back the week after that, for this Supreme Court hearing. 
I just think it's really important that we go forward, there's major tech investigations going on and we were going to have both the head of the FTC and the head of the antitrust division. So, I hope we can schedule this. I thought it was really unfortunate this got cancelled because of this hearing. 
GRAHAM: Yeah, well, I think this hearing is important and I agree what you're warning is important and we'll, we'll get there. Somehow, we'll get there. Senator Cruz. 
CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Returning to Mr. Comey. Mr. Comey, you testified earlier today that you have concerns whenever the FBI doesn't operate in a quote ""competent and honest way."" In your judgment was the way that the FBI handled the Russia investigation, the surveillance of the Trump campaign, the Carter Page FISA application, the Michael Flynn investigation, was that handled in a competent and honest way? 
COMEY: First, senator, cause I, there was no, to my knowledge, surveillance of the Trump campaign. I think the overall investigation of the Russian interference and whether Americans were associated with it, was conducted in an honest, competent, independent way (INAUDIBLE) 
CRUZ: Okay. So, Mr. Comey, you're saying it's competent and honest. I assume you've read the Horowitz Inspector General report which found 17 significant errors or admissions--omissions in the Carter Page FISA application. So, in your view, 17 mistakes lie into the court is competent and honest? 
COMEY: Well, I've read the report, I don't believe he concluded there were lies to the court, but there are significant and important failings in the way in which the Carter Page FISA was prepared and renewed. 
CRUZ: Alright Mr.--Mr. Comey, let's go directly to lies. The Inspector General report concluded that Mr. Clinesmith, an attorney who worked for you in the FBI, deliberately altered an email. He had emailed the CIA to ask if Carter Page was a source. 
The CIA came back and said yes, he was source. And, Mr. Clinesmith, your lawyer, altered that email to add the words NOT a source. To make the email say precisely the opposite of what the CIA said. And, that fraudulent document was then used as a basis for a fraudulent submission to the FISA court. You believe that is honest and competent Mr. Comey? 
COMEY: I don't believe you've offered an accurate summary of the Horowitz's findings. 
CRUZ: Mr. Comey, I have the report right in front of me, page 254, describes how the lawyer specifically the words and not a source, had been inserted--inserted in the response. Directly reversing what the CIA says. Was it practice in your FBI to fraudulently alter evidence that you submit to federal courts? 
COMEY: It was not the practice in the FBI to fraudulently alter anything as presented to federal courts. 
CRUZ: Well, it is difficult to say that that an investigation that featured fraudulent evidence is competent and honest. But let's move on to something else. The predicate of much of this investigation was the Steele dossier, which has now been totally discredited as garbage. When did you learn that the Steele dossier was being funded by the Democratic National Committee in the Hillary Clinton campaign? 
COMEY: Again, I believe your predicate is inaccurate. But I first learned of the Steele dossier in late September of 2016. And, understood that it was funded by political opposition to President Trump or candidate Trump. I didn't know the specifics of which part of the opposition, but I knew that it was political opposition research funding. 
CRUZ: When? When did--did you learn that? 
COMEY: I think about the time I was briefed on it. So, about the same time. Probably the third week of September. 
CRUZ: So, you were personally aware that that the political opposition, whether the DNC or Hillary Clinton or whatever--whatever campaign bucket it was coming from; it was the opposing party that was funding it. You were specifically aware of it in September, why didn't you tell the FISA court? Why did you omit that over and over and over again, on applications you submitted, didn't the court deserve to know that? 
COMEY: My recollection is the FISA court was alerted to the possibility that it was a politically biased reporting. 
CRUZ: Your recollection is--is false. The FISA court was not told that it was funded by the DNC. That's one of the omissions that your FBI did repeatedly to the federal court. Alright, another question--go ahead. 
COMEY: That's not what I just said, so-- 
CRUZ: Well, what did you just say? 
COMEY: I said my recollection is the court was alerted that there was potential political bias in this reporting. 
CRUZ: Political bias is different from saying it was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign. You just testified to this committee you were specifically aware of that. And yet, you repeatedly did not inform the court of it, when you were getting an order to essentially weaponize the--the Democratic opposition research. Alright, next question. When did you learn that the primary sub source, so the basis for this garbage Steele dossier, was a suspected Russian asset? 
COMEY: I don't remember ever being informed of any prior investigation of the--any of Steele's sources, including the primary sub source. 
CRUZ: So, you're not aware of it today? 
COMEY: I'm aware of it today, because I've read it in the public sphere, and I've read a summary memo that the Department of Justice sent to the Judiciary Committee. 
CRUZ: I would note the primary sub source was subject to FBI investigation, a counterintelligence investigation from 2009 to 2011. And, I will read some of what the investigation was. The primary sub source approached two individuals who are about to enter the Obama administration and indicated that if quote, ""the two individuals at the table did get a job in the government, and had access to classified information and wanted to make a little extra money, the primary sub source knew some people to whom they could speak."" 
He is trying to recruit spies against the U.S. government. You have a Russian agent that is the basis for an FBI investigation. And, the FBI is the one who had investigated them. Your testimony is you didn't know did-- did--did it occur to you to ask? Did you--did--did was--did you ask any questions or do any due diligence on this at all? 
COMEY: I don't know anything about the facts that have been revealed recently about the sub source. And, as I said earlier, I think that cuts both ways. But I don't know how the people running the investigation thought about it. 
CRUZ: Well, you didn't tell the FISA court that either. And, I suspect the FISA court would of had a very different assessment if you had told them, that the basis for your application was what you were being told from a suspected Russian asset. Alright, let's shift to another topic. On May 3rd, 2017, in this committee, Chairman Grassley asked you point blank quote, ""have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports, about matters relating to the Trump investigation of the Clinton investigation?"" 
You responded under oath quote, ""never."" He then asked you quote, ""have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton administration?"" You responded again, under oath, no. 
Now, as you know, Mr. McCabe who works for you has publicly and repeatedly stated that he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were a directly aware of it. And, that you directly authorized it. Now, what Mr. Kenton--McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee, cannot both be true. One or the other is false. Who's telling the truth? 
COMEY: I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by what the testimony you summarized, that I gave in May, of 2017. 
CRUZ: So, your testimony is you've never authorized anyone to leak? And, Mr. McCabe, when he--if he says contrary, is not telling the truth. Is that correct? 
COMEY: Again, I'm not gonna characterize Andy's testimony, but mine is the same today. 
CRUZ: Alright. I'm going to make a final point 'cause my time has expired. This investigation of the president was corrupt, the FBI and the Department of Justice were politicized and weaponized. And, in my opinion, there are only two possibilities; that you were deliberately color--corrupt or willfully incompetent. 
And, I don't believe you were incompetent. This has done severe damage to the professionals and the honorable men and women at the FBI because law enforcement should not be used as a political weapon. And, that is the legacy you have left. 
GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal--I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, Senator Klobuchar. I didn't see you; I apologize. 
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much, Director Comey, for being here once again. I think a lot of people are wondering why we are having this hearing right now. And, I think most people would think we should be talking about other things, except maybe President Trump. And I understand the chair's statements about wanting to move on FISA reform. 
I will point out the Republicans have been running the Senate for the last four years, they have their own internal disagreements on FISA. The president has been president for the last four years. And, I haven't heard him talking about FISA reform, repeatedly, as one of his major priorities. I'm sure if he wanted to make this a major priority, within your party, it could have gotten done. But instead, we are having this hearing, right now. 
And, I will get to Mr. Comey, in a while. I'll note that he has appeared before this committee many times. If you look at all of these reports about what he did in his time in office. I don't agree with everything that he did, but I do know as being his classmate in law school, I could call him anytime and ask him things. 
But I also know that he had the respect of a lot of people that worked for him. And so, if I look at legacies, we all have mixed legacies. We all have things that we regret. We have things that we're proud of. But I know that one of his legacies with that--he did have support for law enforcement. I know it from people in Minnesota. And, I would note that he was fired--when were you fired, Mr. Comey? 
COMEY: May 9th of 2017. 
KLOBUCHAR: And where were you when you found out that you were fired by the president? 
COMEY: In Los Angeles for a diversity recruiting event. I found out on television. 
KLOBUCHAR: And I know that you went all around the country talking to law enforcement. Is that right, during your time as head of the FBI? 
COMEY: Yes. 
KLOBUCHAR: And are you proud of the work that the people did in the FBI? 
COMEY: Enormously. It was one of the highlights of my entire life, to be associated with them. 
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. So, what I'm thinking as people watch this, not that many people are, but if they are; what they're thinking is, what are you guys doing? First of all, there is an election coming up in a few weeks. And, as Senator Durbin has pointed out, there are a lot of concerns right now about Russia. Not about what Mr. Comey was involved in in that investigation years ago. 
But what's was happening, right now. We have Director Wray himself the current FBI director appointed by President Trump, saying Russia is very active in the 2020 election. Primarily, through what we would call malign foreign influence, in an attempt to undermine Joe Biden, to denigrate Vice President Biden. That's a quote. Mueller, we know this, the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign knew about it. 
We know that we have Director Coats saying that Russia is the former Director Coats, is the most aggressive foreign actor, no question, quote from Coats, former Senator here, ""the warning lights are blinking red again"". And then, we have the CIA world intelligence review, we assess the President Vladimir Putin and the senior-most Russian officials are aware of and probably directing Russia's influence operations aimed at denigrating the former U.S. vice president, supporting the U.S. president, and fueling public discord ahead of the U.S. election in November. 
So, that's the hearing that we should be having right now, or as was pointed out by Senator Whitehouse, we could be having the hearing we were supposed to be having right now. Which is the head of the antitrust division of the Justice Department and the head of the FTC. Where we've got fraud going on during this pandemic. We could be asking them about innocent people being hurt. 
We could be asking them about as Senator Whitehouse has pointed out, what in the world is going on over at the antitrust division? Why they devoted so many resources to marijuana mergers? And, we could be asking them the results of their tech investigations, which is now basically 20 percent of the stock market. Those are pretty important things. Or we could instead of being here, rehashing this, of someone who is asking someone who is fired from their job by the president along with so many other people. 
We could be trying to figure out what we should be doing for the American people, during this pandemic. 850 people a day--850 people day dying from the coronavirus. 800 businesses closed, every single day, but here we are rehashing this. So, to me, if anyone watched that debate last night, since I believe that's why we're having this hearing, 'cause we're just a few weeks out. 
We might as well be pretty blatant about it. If anyone watched the debate tonight and saw--last night--and saw the president in all of his heckling glory, I think what they saw was someone who's trying to undermine our elections, spreading falsehoods about voting by Mail. When in fact, so many people in this building and Republican governors across this country, have said it's perfectly safe to vote by mail. 
Refusing to condemn white supremacy, in front of the entire nation; that's not something you clean up the next day. All of this is done to wreak havoc right before an election. So, that's what I think we should be talking about today, but instead, we're here with you, Director Comey. So, I will ask you some very quick questions. When you were FBI director did you become aware at some point prior to the 2016 presidential election that Russia launched a sophisticated effort to disrupt and interfere in the U.S. election? 
COMEY: Yes. 
KLOBUCHAR: And, as the FBI and intelligence agencies were learning about that threat, did you also become aware of efforts by the Russians to pass information to the Trump campaign that they believed would be helpful? 
COMEY: Yes. 
KLOBUCHAR: Is it true that there were more than 120 contacts between the Trump campaign and individuals linked to Russia? 
COMEY: I think that is the number I recall from the Senate Intel report and the Mueller report; somewhere in that area. 
KLOBUCHAR: Do you agree with the Trump administration intelligence officials that I just quoted, including your successor at the FBI, that President Trump appointed, that Russia is emboldened and trying it again? 
COMEY: Yes, I accept what Director Chris Wray said, he's a person of integrity, which makes his life difficult now, but the American people can trust him. 
KLOBUCHAR: Does coordinating with a foreign power as part of a political campaign, especially a foreign adversary like Russia, pose a serious threat to our national security? 
COMEY: Yes. 
KLOBUCHAR: And, why do you think, since again, we have chosen to--to have this hearing literally weeks before the election, throwing aside all other subjects, so that we could be devoted to at the time--why do you think that nearly 500 national security experts including former military leaders have said that the current president has demonstrated that he is not equal to the enormous responsibilities of his office? Why do you think you that Republicans, Democrats, and independents have said this? 
COMEY: Because those are people whose spine is a commitment to integrity. And, they see an absolute absence of that, with the current commander in chief. And, it concerns all of them without regard to their politics, as it should. 
KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Comey. 
GRAHAM: We will, if okay, do Senator Sasse, and give the--Mr. Comey about a ten-minute break, a restroom break. Is that okay Mr. Comey? 
COMEY: Yes, Sir. 
GRAHAM: Okay great. And, just one response to Senator Klobuchar, who I consider a friend. I'll be honest with you, you wouldn't be having this hearing and everybody in the world knows it. The Horowitz Report, which is damning, was never--never appeared before the House Judiciary Committee. 
You all don't care. As a party, you seem to be only worried about Trump and Russia. And, when there's evidence coming out of every corner of the world, that the Russians played the FBI through a DNC operative; that's just have no consequences. Let the American people know. If you were in charge, we wouldn't know any of this. Senator Sasse. 
SASSE: Thank you, chairman. Director Comey, I think that the Horowitz Report is not just saddening and infuriating, it's also really embarrassing. As somebody who cares deeply about the FBI, and its culture, and its workers. We've got a whole bunch of American patriotic heroes who work inside that institution. 
And, they have lost standing, they've lost respect in the eyes of the American people, a lot of trusts has evaporated. I've fought hard to defend the FBI and its culture. And, I was embarrassed to read the Horowitz Report. When you read it, what were the top two or three things that you're embarrassed by? 
COMEY: Well, I think I share your reaction, Senator Sasse. The collection of omissions, failures to consider updates, to communicate between the team, trying to figure out what's true and what's not true with the Steele material, and the team investigating Carter Page, is embarrassing. 
It's sloppy-- it's I'm running out of words, that there's no indication and the Inspector General would say it if he found it, that people were doing bad things on purpose. But that doesn't make it any less concerning and embarrassing. 
SASSE: But doesn't that point at you? I mean, you and I have spoken multiple times over my five and a half years here, or I guess from arriving here in January of 2015, through to your departure in 2017. You and I had many, many, discussions about the future of cyber and information operations, against not just the United States government, but against institutions more broadly, that would sow distrust. 
And, you and I agreed that the FBI had not just an incredibly important mission in that space, but a really hard mission; there was a lot of work to be done to be sure we were prepared to play defense against the kind of cyber and information operations that we're now talking about here, today. And, we said, you and I agreed on this, that public trust was at risk. And, as we listen to you testify today repeatedly, you say things like, I was unaware. 
There's this passive voice about how all these things happened in the Bureau. It was your culture, you were the leader, you were to maintain and--and build up that culture. And, you understood the nature of the challenge. Isn't the Horowitz Report chiefly an indictment of you, personally? 
COMEY: Oh, two things are true, and I hope you don't hear me to say, I'm not responsible. I was a leader of that institution. So, this reflects on me entirely. And, it's my responsibility. That's a separate question from whether I was briefed on a particular aspect of a particular investigation. But no, I'm not looking to shirk responsibility, the director is responsible. 
SASSE: I appreciate that. That it's a real answer. But my question wasn't just about the particular investigation, that's the headline of today's hearing. It's that the IG Horowitz--IG Horowitz's report talks about a FISA process that is riddled with errors, every single place they looked, it was crap. You were in charge. 
How is it possible that the FISA process is that bad? I have defended the FISA process. I've fought against many of the particular reforms that some of my colleagues have wanted to advance because I believe the checks and balances in the system were real. You were responsible for those checks and balances. Where were you? 
COMEY: Yeah, that's a great question. I think all of us, me in particular, took comfort in the complexity of the layers and layers of review and oversight associated with FISA. And, I actually think given that they found problems in every FISA application, that what we thought was a good thing, was actually a bad thing. And, I hope they're looking at returning the model to one closer to criminal wiretaps. 
Where a single agent and a single lawyer are responsible, and they feel the squeeze of signing their name. What happened to us, I think, through a lot of years of creating oversight is responsibility was diffused, instead of concentrated in individual human beings. I hope that's something Inspector General and the Director are looking at. But I share your concern, it's a really important question. 
SASSE: I think that's insufficient. I--I have a lot of neighbors in Nebraska who believe there is a massive deep state conspiracy. I don't believe most of those conspiracy theories, but it is really hard to understand how that many special agents, and I want to be clear the vast majority of special agents are wonderful hardworking humans who have lots of opportunities to earn more money and have more schedule control if they were doing something else, the FBI is filled with men and women who do great stuff for the American people. 
So, I want to fight hard to defend against impugning so many of them. And yet, it appears that at the top of your organization there was a culture where many of the people who should have been doing the hard work to make sure the checks and balances were fully carried out, didn't think there was really any chance they would get caught. 
And so, they could be sloppy to malicious. A lot of people in this room and--and watching at home or--or who read the--the Horowitz Report can have different views about how much of this is incompetence to evil. But somewhere on that continuum, there was a whole hell of a lot of people at the top of your organization, who didn't ever actually think that we're going to be held accountable. 
What--what did you do to manage the FISA process, so that you don't just have the passive voice that we've heard in the vast majority of your answers today? I was unaware, this happened, this was an individual particular error, but it didn't speak systemically. But the truth is, you are responsible for systemically and systematically managing that culture. What did you do to make sure the FISA process would work? 
COMEY: First, senator, then the notion of a deep state, I hope people who think that would take a look at the fact that the Inspector General found mistakes in FISA applications across counterintelligence, counterterrorism, all manner of cases; very difficult to reconcile that finding with the notion of that was a deep state. But it does indicate there is a problem with attention to the requirements of preparing an adequate FISA. 
I clearly didn't do enough. I believe that our process which I kept myself closely informed about was robust, well-staffed, had great manuals, and all those sorts of things. I was clearly wrong about that and had too much confidence in that oversight regime. And, I think, based on my experience that the problem may well be deceptively simple. The responsibility was spread among dozens of people instead of being focused, the way it is in a criminal case. 
SASSE: But the leadership in your office didn't have oversight of the dozens of people who would sign off on the most important investigations. The bureau has done amazing things in its century of existence. And, there have been lots of high profile investigations. But this one was obviously one of the most high-profile investigations ever conducted. And, the people at the top didn't think that they would actually have their work checked. 
Mr. Chairman, I continue to believe that we have to explain to the American people why the FISA process is important. The Russia challenges that we faced in 2016, and that we clearly are facing again in 2020, are a big deal. But the much bigger deal is the Chinese Communist Party attacks on the American election, that are coming over the next decade. Putin is clunky as heck in how he does everything he does. 
When the CCP does all that they are capable of doing; it's going to make Russia interference look like child's play. And, the FBI and the broader intelligence community have a vitally important role to play, in helping protect the American people. And, we have to explain to the American public why the FISA process is so critically important. And, we have to reform this culture. 
I'm a big Amy Klobuchar fan in lots of ways, but I disagree with the line of argument that the that this broad hearing topic isn't important. The reality is we're headed toward a world where if we don't fix the national security branch and the counterintelligence pieces of the FBI. We're not going to have an intelligence community that's going to have the trust of the American people when they're going to have to employ bigger and more far-reaching digital tools, in the future. Thank you. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, and Senator Coons, I think you want to have questions before we break? Is it--is it okay with you, Mr. Comey? 
KLOBUCHAR: Can I just respond, since my name was invoked? 
GRAHAM: Sure. 
SASSE: It was invoked pretty positively-- 
KLOBUCHAR: Pretty positively, I appreciate it. I have no issue with having this hearing and I think it's something many people up here agree. My only point was there's been years to fix it since this happened and we weren't running in the Senate, that was my point. 
GRAHAM: Yep. So, and I'll turn it over to Senator Coons, then we'll take a ten-minute break. I just want to put a fine point on this. An FBI lawyer altered a document in a fashion to be damning to an American citizen. That's not sloppy; that's a crime. And, when does it become obvious to anybody that the people in charge of Crossfire Hurricane had a deep-seated bias against Trump? 
They thought he was an idiot; they thought his of supporters were smelly. The person who altered the email, can--claimed to be part of the resistance. When did it--becomes obvious that the reason this thing was so screwed up, that the reason every stop sign was run, 'cause they didn't want to take no for the answer? 
That is obvious to me. That's not in every other FISA application. They're problems with the Woods procedure, but we haven't found one where a lawyer altered the document and every time it was exculpatory information, it was withheld from the court. And, what kind of system is it that the FBI director has no clue about the most important investigation, maybe in the history of the FBI? If you want to believe that, and just write this off, I think you do so at your own peril. Senator Coons. 
CRUZ: And, Mr. Chairman, just underscore your point, every one of the 17 material witnesses were against President Trump and against the campaign; they weren't random. They were all politically oriented against the president, they were trying to takedown. 
GRAHAM: Senator Coons. 
COONS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Comey, for your testimony today. And, for engaging with us in this vigorous and thorough review of matters that occurred now four and five years ago, but that remain relevant and important. But I want to remind all of us the context in which this hearing is taken place. We have 34 days to our presidential election. More than half the states have already started voting. 
We're in the middle of a pandemic, an economic crisis, a time of heightened racial tension, and concern about criminal justice. And, instead of dedicating the next week or two to finalizing a next round of COVID relief, we're going to be spending our time at least here, not looking at election security for 2020, not dedicating our time to a next round of pandemic relief, but participating in a rushed and partisan process to confirm a next Supreme Court Justice. 
It is important to remind folks that our elections are being attacked, at this very moment, that we know from recent testimony by the current FBI director that there continues to be foreign interference in our elections. And so, I think at some level, there is irony in light of the fact that last night we had a presidential debate in which our currently serving president said and did things to undermine some of the legitimacy of our upcoming election. 
Let me start with just a few questions about that, if I might, Mr. Comey. Current FBI Director Wray has said the FBI has not seen evidence of any coordinated voter fraud effort, over 30 million people voted by mail or absentee four years ago in 2016. In your time as FBI Director did you see any evidence of widespread or coordinated voter fraud? 
COMEY: No. 
COONS: And last night, repeated allegations were made by President Trump of Mail-in voting being subject to widespread fraud. Do comments like this work to undermine democratic legitimacy and in any way serve the interests of our opponents who are seeking to spread disinformation and attack Mail-in voting? 
COMEY: Well, I'm not going to--I'm not--I don't think I am qualified to respond on that particular comment. Obviously, our adversaries especially Russia, have as their primary goal dividing us and dirtying up the democratic enterprise. 
COONS: I'm--let me just say to the core issues that have been discussed and debated here. I've joined Senators Leahy and Lee, in an amendment to try and promote FISA reform. I agree that we need our FISA process to be sound, to be transparent, to be something the American people can believe in. And, I think the inspector general's recommendations addressed some of these key issues, and give us a road map for a number of the things that have to be addressed. 
But I--I also, frankly, I'm concerned about the way in which the current FBI director's been under relentless criticism and assault. And, there seems to me to be from our president, a politicization, a backward-looking series of attacks. 
Let me just ask you a few questions about that, if I might. President Trump has repeatedly referred to something he calls Obamagate. He said it is worse than Watergate. Are you aware of any evidence that President Obama or former Vice president Biden has committed any federal crime? 
COMEY: No. 
COONS: Did you ever see any evidence that President Obama or Vice President Biden targeted any individual for investigation, based on politics or their political views? 
COMEY: Never. 
COONS: There was a January 5th, 2017, meeting at the White House, was Peter Strzok at that meeting, in the Oval Office? 
COMEY: No. 
COONS: And at the meeting did either President Obama or Vice President Biden suggest prosecuting Lieutenant General Flynn, under the Logan Act? Would you remember that if that suggestion had been made to you? 
COMEY: I would remember it because it would be highly inappropriate for a president or vice president to suggest prosecution or investigation of anyone. And, it did not happen. 
COONS: At that meeting on January 5th, at the White House and this is in 2017, did President Obama give any indication that he wanted to direct the course of a criminal investigation into General Flynn's conduct? 
COMEY: No. 
COONS: And when you left the meeting, did you believe politics would play a role in the Flynn case? 
COMEY: No, I knew it would play no role. 
COONS: So, during your time at the FBI, under the previous administration, were you ever pressured to take an investigative step or support a conclusion that was not based on the facts in the wall(PH)? 
COMEY: No. 
COONS: But only weeks after his inauguration, my recollection is President Trump asked you to drop the investigation into Lieutenant General Flynn and to let this go. Is that accurate? 
COMEY: Yes, February 14th. 
COONS: So, my concern, broadly speaking, is that we have seen politics injected into our justice system countless times, over the last four years. Is there any doubt in your mind that Lieutenant General Flynn lied to the FBI about his conversations with the Russians? 
COMEY: None. I mean I saw publicly he pled guilty to it twice. 
COONS: Can you explain why lying to the FBI strikes at the heart of our criminal justice system? 
COMEY: Because the FBI's ability to figure out what's going on in a criminal investigation or counterintelligence investigation, is at the core of our ability to protect the American people. If we don't hear the truth, see the truth, gather the truth; we can't achieve the mission. 
COONS: There's been a lot of discussions today about the so-called Steele dossier. Did the Crossfire Hurricane team rely on information from that dossier in its decision to open the investigation? 
COMEY: No, not at all. 
COONS: And was the team even aware of the information when they opened the investigation? 
COMEY: No. It was--I think it was two months later that the Steele information came to the Crossfire Hurricane team. 
COONS: So, when you said earlier that this was an appropriately predicated and opened investigation, it's because of that difference in time and sources, and the basis on which those decisions were made? 
COMEY: Correct. As the Inspector General found in opening it, we complied with the policies and regulations that govern the opening of a counterintelligence investigation. We should have been fired. There ought of had been a hearing if we didn't investigate given the evidence that we were given by a foreign--friendly foreign government. 
COONS: And, last, when he testified to this committee in June, Rod Rosenstein, suggested he did not believe that any of the 199 criminal counts that resulted from the Mueller investigation relied on information provided by Steele. Do you have any reason to doubt that assessment? 
COMEY: I have no reason to doubt that. 
COONS: I just want to thank you for your appearance before us today. There are many urgent things we could and should be working on together. It is my hope that we will get back to them. I do agree the FISA process requires transparency and improvement. 
But Frankly, I think there is a connect the dots game going on here, that doesn't connect. And, I am gravely concerned about ongoing efforts to denigrate and politicize the FBI, today. Thank you, Mr. Comey, for your testimony today. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. We are going to take about a--we'll come back at 12:45 and give the witness a break and see you at 12:45. Senator Hawley will be next. 
(RECESS) 
Thank you. Appreciate the break. Mr. Comey, are you with us? 
COMEY: Yes, sir. 
GRAHAM: Okay, good. Thank you very much. Was that a sufficient break for you? You're okay? 
COMEY: Yes, thanks very much. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Hawley. 
HAWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Comey, we've heard a number of things this morning. We've heard you say a number of times that the OIG found problems in FISA applications across the board. But, of course, it was only this FISA applications, these involving Carter Page that you signed off on, that drew an unprecedented rebuke from the FISA Court, which I'm sure you remember. 
Let me just quote from that FISA court order, ""The frequency and seriousness of these errors in a case that given its sensitive nature, had an unusually high level of review at both DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have called into question, the reliability of the information proffered and other FBI applications."" Do you remember that--that order from the court? 
COMEY: It came after I left, as I recall, but I remember reading about it. Yes. 
HAWLEY: And have you ever known the court to issue any other such order that you're familiar with? 
COMEY: Yes. 
HAWLEY: You have known the court to issue orders rebuking the FBI for misleading it in the past? 
COMEY: Yes. Shortly before 9/11, there was significant criticism by the FISA court of the quality of FISA applications. 
HAWLEY: And the court said that the frequency and seriousness of the errors in this--in applications led it to doubt the reliability of all FBI applications in all other cases? 
COMEY: I don't remember the exact words but something similar, and as I recall, they banned at least one agent from appearing in FISA applications. 
HAWLEY: Yeah, well, that's not what they did here. I mean, in this case, the FISA court said that they had reason to doubt the reliability of FBI applications across cases because of the level of misleading information that you personally signed off on. Do you regret your role in this unprecedented misleading of a FISA court? 
COMEY: I don't regret my role. I regret that it happened. 
HAWLEY: Why not? 
COMEY: I'm sorry. 
HAWLEY: Why don't you regret your role in the unprecedented misleading of a FISA court? 
COMEY: Well, I regret that the FBI supplied information to a FISA court that was inaccurate, incomplete, and should have been updated. 
HAWLEY: Do you regret that you signed off on it? 
COMEY: I regret that it happened. The only reason I'm hesitating is what the FBI director does in connection with a FISA is actually very narrow but put that to the side. It's important that it be accurate. It wasn't and I regret that very much. 
HAWLEY: Listen, you said this several times and I frankly don't understand it. The certification that the statute requires is a certification by the FBI director as to the contents of the application. You signed off on it. The FISA court said it was so misleading that it now had reason to doubt the FBI is truthfulness across the board. Are you responsible for these certifications or not? 
COMEY: I don't believe you're accurately describing the statutory requirement for certification. 
HAWLEY: Are you responsible for these certifications or not? Answer my question. 
COMEY: I signed certifications on every FISA that the FBI sends over to the FISA court including these. 
HAWLEY: Are you responsible for this misleading evidence given to the FISA court? Yes, or no? 
COMEY: Yes, in the sense of command responsibility. No, in that I didn't have personal knowledge it would have led me to understand that we weren't supplying complete information. 
HAWLEY: Let's talk about what personal knowledge you have. When you certified the first Carter Page FISA application you believe that Mr. Steele was working for the Democratic Party, didn't you? 
COMEY: I don't remember that--whether I knew the Democratic Party, I knew that he was working for political opponents of President Trump. 
HAWLEY: Now, let me remind you of your testimony under oath on December 7, 2018, before the House Oversight Committee in which you said and I quote, ""Steele was retained by Republicans at first for Mr. Trump during the primary season and then his work was underwritten after that by Democrats, opposed to Mr. Trump during the general election season,"" end quote. 
Now, surely you recognized at the time that relying so heavily on a biased source would undermine public confidence in the FBI's activities, didn't you? 
COMEY: No, I did not. 
HAWLEY: Why wouldn't you? You told the same committee, the House Oversight Committee, December 7, 2018, and I quote, ""When you're the leader of a justice agency,"" that's you, ""the appearance of bias is as important as the existence of actual bias."" You also said, ""a reasonable appearance of bias can corrupt the Americans people's faith in your work as much as actual bias can."" Do you stand by those remarks? 
COMEY: Very much so. 
HAWLEY: But you nevertheless allowed the Democratic Party to leverage The Federal Government's most invasive intelligence capabilities against President Trump and you personally signed off on it. You also knew at the time that other officials in the Department of Justice had serious concerns. Do you know who Stuart Evans is? 
COMEY: I do. 
HAWLEY: Mr. Evans is a lawyer in the National Security Division of DOJ under President Obama, wasn't he? 
COMEY: I think he was. I don't know for sure. I think he was a career official at the Department of Justice involved in-- 
HAWLEY: --He was a lawyer in the National Security Division of the Department of Justice. Before the first Carter Page FISA application, Mr. Evans raised serious concerns about the ostensibly partisan nature of the information provided by Mr. Steele, did he not? 
COMEY: I don't know. 
HAWLEY: He did. The Inspector General reports it on pages 136 and 137 of this report and you knew of those concerns before you signed off on the FISA application, didn't you? 
COMEY: I don't think I knew before I remember reading the footnote that attempted to inform the court of potential bias. 
HAWLEY: No, actually, the Inspector General found on page 139 of the report, and I quote, ""On October 12, 2016, Evans's concerns about Steele were briefed to Comey,"" end quote. And yet you signed off knowing--knowing that the research was funded by the Democratic Party, knowing that senior officials in the Department of Justice National Security Division had serious concerns you signed off, nonetheless. 
Let's talk about what else you knew or didn't know, when you certified that FISA application, did you know the allegations in the Steele dossier came from sub-sources, not from Steele's own knowledge? 
COMEY: I believe I did know he had a network of sources and sub-sources. Correct. 
HAWLEY: Did you know who this primary sub-source was? 
COMEY: No. 
HAWLEY: Did you ask who the primary sub source was? 
COMEY: No. 
HAWLEY: Did you ask the FBI to take any steps to identify that source before submitting this application to the FISA court? 
COMEY: I don't know whether I asked, I knew there was an effort underway to try to replicate Steele's source network so we could figure out what to make of Steele's reporting. 
HAWLEY: Well, what the--what the Inspector General concluded was that Comey told us--this is page 153, that the application seemed factually and legally sufficient when he read it. And he had no questions or concerns before he signed it. Surely you realize that the source's identity and his motives, this sub-source, who we now know, may well have been a Russian agent, that that would affect his credibility, correct? 
COMEY: I thought it was important that we were informing the court of any potential bias from any source. And I remember reading language in this--in that initial filing that addressed that potential bias issue with respect to the Steele reporting. 
HAWLEY: So you're--I'm sorry, your testimony now is that you informed the court of potential problems with the sub-source, political motivations, connections to foreign governments, the FISA court was informed about that? 
COMEY: No, I'm sorry, I understood your question to be about whether we inform the court about potential bias in Steele's reporting. I didn't know the identity or any information about sub-sources. 
HAWLEY: So you personally authorized an unprecedented surveillance on an individual associated with the presidential campaign during that campaign's ongoing time periods. October of 2016, you signed off personally on two further applications based on information from a source that you believed correctly worked for the Democratic Party and the sources information, it turns out was coming from a suspected Russian agent, yet you did nothing to try to verify any of this information. You brushed aside the concerns of high-level national security lawyers at the Department of Justice. How are the American people to trust you, or the FBI following abuses like this? 
COMEY: I disagree extensively with your predicate. I think the FBI is an organization that is honest, competent, independent, and also flawed because it's made up of human beings. 
HAWLEY: Well, I've had to say, I'm not--I'm not necessarily worried about the FBI as a whole. I'm worried about you and I'm worried about what you certified to a court that led the FISA court to conclude that it had been misled repeatedly. And that due to the nature of that those repeated misrepresentations, it could no longer trust what the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the agency you lead, what it said in subsequent cases, that I suggest to you is an incredible dereliction of duty, indeed a betrayal of your responsibility as director of the FBI. 
If I could, Mr. Chairman, just one last thing I want to follow up on. The letter from--to--to Chairman Graham from John Ratcliffe, which I know you've seen Mr. Comey is you mentioned it earlier, Mr. Ratcliffe says, ""On--on 7 September 2016, U.S. intelligence officials forwarded an investigative referral to FBI Director James Comey regarding U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning Donald Trump and Russian hackers as a means of distracting the public forum her use of a private mail server,"" end quote. Did you open an investigation? 
COMEY: I don't know what that refers to, as I said earlier that does not ring any bells with me when I read that. 
HAWLEY: You did not receive any investigative referral of this nature? 
COMEY: I don't remember it. I don't--I don't remember receiving anything that's described in that letter. 
HAWLEY: Okay. I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I realize my time has expired. I find it extraordinary that a referral from the IC to the FBI regarding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and potential illicit activity received no--no attention for the FBI. So little attention the director doesn't even recall it. And yet, the director and others had plenty of time to go and seek surveillance warrants during an ongoing presidential campaign, warrants so flawed that the FISA court has now said it can't trust what the FBI says in future cases. This is an extraordinary abuse of power and it's time we hold people responsible for it. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal. 
BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Comey, thank you for being here today. Thank you for your service to our nation and thank you for your family's as well, your wife's in particular. 
I think that this hearing is likely to attract as much attention and land with the same giant thud as the previous two hearings because the American people are really focused on the direct and imminent threats to our nation. The pandemic continues to kill almost 1,000 Americans a day due to the cruel indifference and callous neglect of this administration. People are continuing to lose jobs. Millions are unemployed and our small businesses are struggling. 
And here we are re-litigating a controversy that is four years old, involving an investigation into Russian interference that occurred in 2016, when the really imminent and urgent threat is Russian interference ongoing at this very moment. The Security Director--Security Center Director William Evanina, warned publicly, quote, ""Russia continues to spread this information in the U.S. that is designed to undermine our democracy."" 
And I can say that the information we've received in briefings is absolutely chilling. We've received that information in confidential, classified briefings that I wish could be made known to the American public with the same kind of alacrity that documents had been declassified in this proceeding. The American people deserve to know about that threat, which is ongoing. And they also need to know about the threat of white supremacists. 
The current director of the FBI has said again, publicly, racially motivated, violent extremists are a quote, ""national threat priority."" A national threat priority, a security danger to this country. They are the same white supremacists, that the president of the United States last night, said should stand by. That statement is one of the most abhorrent and horrifying in my lifetime. 
Mr. Comey, in your time as FBI Director, did you see an uptick in white supremacists' activities in the United States? And if so, with what kinds of consequences? 
COMEY: Yes, it is my recollection and the consequences were potential acts of violence, intimidation of people of color, all the things that come with a criminal group with an aim that is at its heart evil racism. 
BLUMENTHAL: Did you regard it as a national security threat in the way that Mr. Wray has articulated? 
COMEY: Yes, it was assigned to our counterterrorism division which focuses on national security threats. 
BLUMENTHAL: Do you think that more resources should be devoted to this threat? 
COMEY: It's hard for me to answer since I've been gone now for close to four years. That you can never have enough people with eyes on a problem that poses of violent threat the way these groups do. 
BLUMENTHAL: I've introduced a measure called the NO HATE Act along with a number of my colleagues, Senators Durbin, Hirono, Warner, Kaine, Gillibrand, and others. And there's a measure on the House side as well that would seek to address this growing imminent threat of white supremacists, impact, and violence, rather than telling them to stand by. And I commend you and the current director, Mr. Wray for focusing on it. 
I want to turn to the statements that earlier you made in response to Senator Durbin's inquiry about the $425 million in debt. That has been disclosed as owing by the president. You've done a number of national security background checks and in the course of those background checks, my understanding is that a standard question relates to debt owed by individuals. Is that correct? 
COMEY: Yes, that's correct. 
BLUMENTHAL: And the reason for that question is to indicate and disclose whether or not that individual has concealed any of that debt. Correct? 
COMEY: Correct. One aspect of exploring their financial situation is that. 
BLUMENTHAL: Why is it that those facts are important? 
COMEY: Because deciding whether someone is trustworthy with national security information involves understanding whether they're vulnerable to exploitation by an adversary, by a criminal group. So if somebody owes a lot of money, and is trying to hide that, that allows adversaries to gain leverage over that person and maybe force them to do something they shouldn't do. It's a tool we use to try and recruit foreign government officials to become assets of the United States government and so adversaries do the same to us. 
BLUMENTHAL: So the president of the United States, of course, is not subject to any background security investigation, as most high ranking officials are but it is the concealment of that debt. Not only its gargantuan size but the hiding of it that potentially makes him vulnerable to blackmail, or extortion or other improper influence, correct? 
COMEY: That's right. But even if it were fully transparent, they'd still be concerned about vulnerability. That the adversary could try and cut a secret deal to reduce the debt even if the public knows about the debt. 
BLUMENTHAL: So any individual in a position of responsibility who is concealing a debt as well as the debt itself makes him or her more likely to be an asset under the influence or subject to extortion by a foreign government, correct? 
COMEY: It creates a serious counterintelligence concern that you'd want to address in--in deciding on a clearance suitability for an employee. 
BLUMENTHAL: Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Comey. 
GRAHAM: Thank you, Senator Tillis. 
But to just follow up on the--Senator Blumenthal's questions. Would you be concerned about a counterintelligence threat or a compromise if a candidate's family member was receiving millions of dollars from a corrupt company in the Ukraine? That a candidate's family member was receiving millions of dollars from the deputy mayor of Moscow, that it candidate's family member was getting a billion and a half dollar investment portfolio from the China bank? Would that concern you? 
COMEY: If I were still the FBI I'd be concerned about any effort to exert leverage over a government official potential government official or someone close to them in an effort to influence them. 
GRAHAM: Thank you very much. Senator Tillis. 
BLUMENTHAL: Chairman, if I may just clarify. 
The--the question you've just raised is a hypothetical relating to a non-government--current non-government official. What we have here and what the records reveal quite starkly is that the president of the United States, our commander in chief is vulnerable to leverage and manipulation and even possible blackmail. 
GRAHAM: I understand your point and you have the right to make it and the point I was making is very real. It's not a hypothetical. These things happen. Senator Tillis. 
TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Comey, for being here. 
Mr. Comey, we--I'm not going to ask some questions that have already been asked by prosecutors and lawyers whose preambles and predicates you have rejected. So instead of getting a non-answer, I want to go more from a management perspective. 
We had General Horowitz before this committee, Inspector General Horowitz and he identified as you're aware of the 17 errors and omissions and I--as I look at some of the errors and omissions. Do you think--we know one that was identified as a crime, what do we do with the remainder? I mean, do you accept General Horowitz's reports and his findings? Do you think that they were valid? 
COMEY: I do. And I hope that it was followed by root cause analysis, which any enterprise ought to engaged in, figure out so exactly why did this happen and how should we change to make sure doesn't happen again? 
TILLIS: Well, let's say that you came in as the--the new director of the FBI after the prior director had their organization study, we found these errors and omissions. If--if it didn't rise to a level of a crime, in your opinion, do you think it at least should have prompted terminations and disciplinary action on the part of--these are all highly-trained, highly-educated, highly-experienced professionals in the FBI? And by the way, the majority of them are great people but it's a big organization. But what about the remainder? 
I mean, it--you're the new director, you've gotten this report from the Inspector General, what do you do? What--what is your remediation plan? I've heard you say that you would want to streamline the FISA process. I may get a question and on that but what would you be doing right now, to address the 16 other errors and omissions that occurred under--prior to your watch? 
COMEY: I'd be doing two things, looking wide and looking narrow. Wide to see what the systematic problems are. Looking narrow to try and understand so when these employees made these decisions, what were they thinking? Severe misconduct turns on whether someone was intentionally engaging in wrongdoing and there's a range of misconduct short of that. You want to assess that with respect to everybody with personal knowledge and then make your judgments based on that. 
TILLIS: You were quoted, I want to read this so I don't get your words wrong. But you were quoted as saying, ""The FISA process was followed and that the entire case was handled in a thoughtful, responsible way by the DOJ and the FBI."" You went on to say, ""The notion that FISA was abused is nonsense."" Do you still stand by that? 
COMEY: I don't--I don't think it was abused. But I think I was wrong in having confidence in the FISA process and in the layers of oversight and review. I was too confident in this extensive, really very complicated system. 
TILLIS: The--what would have prompted you on the front end to think that it was okay. I think that you already said in prior testimony that there were things in the FISA process that should have been approved? Why under your watch weren't we already trying to do those kinds of changes? 
COMEY: Well, my confidence was based on the fact that it was regular oversight by the Department of Justice, regular audits of our cases, and then I also understood the complexity of the process. Agents would complain to me everywhere I went, it's too hard to get a FISA, too many people have to check off on it, too many people have to review my work. So knowing the process, which included regular audits gave me confidence as any leader--as a business leader or government leader, that we have a sound healthy process and that was wrong. 
TILLIS: Mr. Comey, one of the things that worry me about this is we're talking about an investigation of someone who was running for president of the United States. I like Senator Sasse had resisted some of the changes that my colleague, Senator Lee was putting forward but I felt like I had confidence in a process that clearly I shouldn't have. And even the FISA court has expressed their concerns at the information presented to them. 
But you know, what I really worry about? I worry about people that would never have a hearing on their case before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I mean, we're here because we're talking about a high-profile elected official. But do you have any concerns that the same sorts of lapses that were used here and I do think people should be held accountable and prosecuted? Do you have any concerns if we go back over the--over the course of the FISA process, that we've had innocent people out there subjected to the same process and potentially wrongfully received a warrant and surveillance? 
COMEY: Sure, it's a reasonable concern. Inspector General did a look across dozens of cases and found mistakes; I think he said in every case. That's a serious concern that there's a systemic problem. Now, that doesn't mean that the warrants wouldn't admit issued otherwise. But that's beside the point. There was an issue and if I were still there, it would be something I would be thinking about every day. I suspect Chris Wray is. 
TILLIS: Mr. Comey, I've got another question. I remember General--Inspector General Horowitz, I asked a series of questions because in--in the report, when he talked about a possible political motivation to the behavior of some of those involved and--and--and identified in the investigation, I asked him about--you know, did he see any evidence of a political motivation. He said that was murky. 
But if you've gone through it, and I'm sure that you have, do you believe that--that this whole process was absent any political bias against the president of the United States? That it was just void of political bias, just a paperwork error or a business process that needed to be streamlined? Or how do you feel about that murky description that General Horowitz gave to the motivations of people? We've seen all the emails and the communications, Viva la Resistance. How do you feel about that? Do you honestly think that this process at the--at the operator level was truly devoid of any political bias? 
COMEY: I do and I'm not just saying that I'm saying that because I read Horowitz's 400-page report, where I think the most important finding is in case opening and the conduct and the investigative decisions there was no evidence found of political bias. And believe (INAUDIBLE) 
TILLIS: --So you don't think its--I'm sorry, go ahead. 
COMEY: If Horowitz finds something he knows how to say it and he found the opposite. And so that's why I say that. 
TILLIS: But why would--why would Inspector General Horowitz who I think is--you know, very capable, Inspector General, go so far as to say it was murky. You say that there's--there's no doubt but we have him say it was murky based on the same information that I read in the report. 
COMEY: I don't know where that--I'm sorry, Senator, I don't know where the murky comment comes from. I'm talking about the report itself, which I've read very carefully, a number of times, and he makes that finding, we found no evidence of political bias in any phase of this investigation. 
TILLIS: Okay, just final question, Mr. Chair. I did start about 45 seconds late. I know Hunter Biden was appointed to Burisma in 2014, the board, while you were the FBI director and Vice President Biden was in--in office. Did you have any concerns? Or did--did you have any concerns about that with--or express and concerns with Vice President Biden? 
COMEY: I never learned anything about it. I didn't know anything about it when I was FBI director. 
TILLIS: Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
GRAHAM: Could I see that, please? Senator Hirono will be next. But I just want to make sure. 
Senator Hirono. 
HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The chairman noted that he is committed to trying to save the FISA system and in fact, IG Horowitz dug very deep into the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and in a 400-page report, as Mr. Comey noted, he found no evidence of political bias but he did note a number of changes that should be made to the FISA application process. 
And in fact, FBI Director Wray is doing those changes, and so, if we are committed to making changes to the application process, and we all share that concern, the hearing today should be focused on whether or not the FBI, in fact, is making those changes that Inspector Horowitz flagged out in his very thorough investigation. 
Mr. Chairman, we understand that DNI Ratcliffe issued a statement claiming that the declassified information--selective declassification, declassified information he released yesterday about Hillary Clinton from Russian sources quote, ""is not Russian disinformation,"" end quote, and yet, he acknowledged that the information he released may be, quote, ""a fabrication."" I find it just amazing that we have DNI Ratcliffe issuing this kind of information practically on the eve of an election, making an allegation, in fact, pushing out Russian disinformation, which he acknowledges. And Mr. Chairman, I think we should have him before this committee so we can question him. 
The Intelligence Community Special Counsel Mueller and the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee all found that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. And, Mr. Chairman, you have acknowledged that. We all know this and we also know that the interference was in favor of Donald Trump and they clearly did not give any weight to Russia's effort to smear Hillary Clinton and this committee should not either. 
More important I do associate myself with the comments made by the Democrats on this committee who are wondering along with the American people why we are going over the same thing that we've already--you know, that we've already gone over that has to do with the--the premises underlying the, excuse me, the Crossfire Hurricane investigation. So we know this is being done somehow to bolster Donald Trump's reelection campaign through innuendo and misinformation which even today Russia is pushing up. 
So we should be concerned about what's going on in the 2020 election. And I have to say thanks to President Trump and my Republican colleagues here we are sitting here, millions of people are without health care, millions of people are without jobs. And rather than dealing with a--very real concerns of the American people in the midst of a pandemic, we are having this hearing to go over ground that we've already covered. 
Let me get to some questions to Mr. Comey. I noticed that DNI Ratcliffe released a--an allegation that he obtained from Russian sources which he himself said it is--admitted as much not reliable. Mr. Comey, as a former FBI Director, do you think it is appropriate for DNI Ratcliffe to release this information right before the election? 
COMEY: It's hard for me to comment because I don't fully understand what he's doing there. The goal of the intelligence community, which includes the FBI should be to stay out of influencing elections except to discharge our duty to protect our democracy and ensure that foreign adversaries are operating in the United States. 
HIRONO: Mr. Comey, you know that what Russia is doing right now is to use this kind of disinformation to interfere with our elections. So they're engaging in malign, foreign influence, as described by FBI Director Wray. And I'd say putting out this kind of information that makes a certain kind of allegations about Hillary Clinton is the kind of disinformation that Russia is engaging in right now. 
And there--I know you're aware that Russia is very good at using social--social media, the use of proxies, state media, online journals, etc. In fact, there's--they're really focused on those kinds of interference at this moment. 
So the kind of information that DNI Ratcliffe released, would that be consistent with Russia's disinformation efforts, Mr. Comey? 
COMEY: I don't know enough to say, Senator. 
HIRONO: I'd say we can draw our own conclusions. 
Earlier this month, one of the top prosecutors working on U.S. Attorney John Durham's (SP) investigation into the origins of Russia's--Russia's probe resigned. She reportedly left out of concern that the team was pressured for political reasons to issue a report before completing its work. And just last week, we saw Attorney General Barr disclose previously classified evidence relating to Mr. Durham's ongoing investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, a release designed to bolster President Trump's reelection chances. 
We also saw the Justice Department coordinate with the White House on multiple press releases about a just opened investigation into allegedly discarded ballots in Pennsylvania. You testified just now that these kinds of actions raise concerns about bias, appearance of bias, and here we have the attorney general making these kinds of disclosures. Do you think that these actions reflect a bias or appearance of bias--bias on the part of Attorney General Barr? 
COMEY: It's difficult for me to say about the particulars that I don't know well enough. But I can say generally, Attorney General Barr has embraced the concept for his role that I believe is at odds with the nature of that department. It needs to be (INAUDIBLE) by all Americans. 
HIRONO: There have been all kinds of articles about Attorney General Barr's politicization of the Attorney General's Office. And do you think that that is a concern for all of us, and why? 
COMEY: It ought to be a concern for all of us because we need that institution and we need that institution to be seen as separate from our tribal warfare because it has to be trusted by jurors and cops and witnesses and judges of all political stripes. We have to be seen as the Department of Justice is outside of all of that and when the Attorney General starts acting like the personal lawyer for the president, it threatens that and that is a priceless thing that's under threat. 
HIRONO: And we've already seen a number of the career professionals at the DOJ resigning, even though I acknowledge and I want to--I want to acknowledge all of the professionals who continue to do their jobs in the DOJ. 
Just one more question, Mr. Chairman, you've been asked a number of questions about the $400 million that President Trump owes. How important is it that the American public should know who that money is owed to? And do you think that we should require all presidential candidates to disclose significant sums of money that they owe to entities or even countries? 
COMEY: My opinion on both of those questions is worth no more than any other American's, we should all want to understand what's going on with our leaders so we can make a sound choice. we vote November. And I'll just leave it there. 
HIRONO: I think you testified is particularly important for those of us who hold offices of public trust to disclose those to whom we'll large sums of money because we are then opening ourselves up to various kinds of influences that will not be good for our country. 
Thank you very much. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. I just want to make a brief comment, we'll go to Senator Ernst. As to the Ratcliffe revelations, why they matter. I don't know how accurate the underlying intelligence is. I know that people have said it wasn't Russian disinformation. But is it true or not is not the question for me. The question is, how can it be that on September the 7th, 2016, the intelligence community asked the director of the FBI, the assistant director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok to look into the regarding U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hacking hampering the U.S. election as a mean of--means of distracting the public from her use of a private mail email server? 
The only thing I'm suggesting is, that's a pretty big deal. Everything Trump has been looked at with Russia, apparently nobody looked at this. Apparently, this was just swept under the rug. And the point we're trying to make here is there is a double standard. It's obvious as night and day and this is, if anything, the smoking gun. Senator Ernst. 
ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. 
Director Comey, and this is for everyone watching as well. FISA warrants aren't just the normal run of the mill search warrants, they seek to access information that we consider most private. And when talking about the Carter Page investigation, the Steele dossier was the basis for this by FISA warrant and no one's doubting that. The Steele dossier is, of course, the opposition research report compiled by Christopher Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign, a dossier that was essentially opposition research on Donald Trump. 
And we thought it was just that until last week when Attorney General Barr authorized the declassification of a specific footnote and Inspector General's report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation from late last year. That's the--the letter that was dated September 24, 2020. The declassification of that footnote revealed something more disturbing about the Steele dossier. And that footnote revealed that the primary sub-source of the Steele dossier was the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation between the years of 2009 and 2011 due to their apparent ties to Russia. The same document that alleged then-candidate Trump was a Russian spy, was funded by political opponents and researched by a suspected Russian operative and the FBI bought it hook, line, and sinker, or at least they really wanted to. 
And it gets worse from there, though. During the investigation into that sub-source, it was revealed that they had reached out to individuals about to join the Obama administration and made them an offer--made them an offer. They could make a quote--in quotes--quote, ""little extra money,"" end quote, if they had access to classified information. Thankfully, those people reported this encounter. An associate of that sub-source also stated that they persistently asked about their knowledge of a particular military vessel. Again, that encounter, thankfully, was reported. 
This sub-source was in contact with a known Russian intelligence officer and was invited to the Russian embassy. And the FBI knew all of this when they sought the first renewal of the Carter Page FISA application. Unlike those other people who reported their strange encounters with this sub-source, what exactly did the FBI do? What did they do? They never provided the information to the FISA court, not one lick of it. The FBI signed off on a violation of Carter Page's privacy using reports that would normally be used to create a 30-second political ad that were compiled by someone who is likely an actual Russian spy. 
And that's not even to speak of the noted inconsistencies that so many of my other colleagues have talked about between the reporting and the Steele dossier and the information that the sub-source provided to Steele himself, inconsistencies that the Crossfire Hurricane team continued to rely upon when seeking renewed FISA warrants on Carter Page. 
Director Comey, according to Peter Strzok, you were briefed on Steele's reporting and okayed the Crossfire Hurricane team's approach to use Steele in the investigation. Do you recall being told about the counterintelligence investigation against this primary sub-source? 
COMEY: I do not. 
ERNST: Do you believe that would--that this information would have been relevant information for the director of the FBI to have received? 
COMEY: I don't know the answer to that. Maybe at some point, it would definitely be important for the team to consider whether it made the sub-source less credible or more credible. I could see it cutting both ways. 
ERNST: Well, I think that's pretty pertinent information when you're authorizing FISA warrants. I would want to know what are the sub-sources motives? You don't think that that's relevant information? 
COMEY: Oh, I thought you were asking what was relevant for them to tell the director, I'm not writing the FISA affidavit, I'm not investigating the case, it's important for the people running the case to think, does the fact that a sub-source has connections to Russia make him more credible or less credible in reporting on Russia? They'd want to wrestle with that and decide what to do with it. 
ERNST: But as the director of the FBI, you are signing off on a FISA warrant--that application. I do think it's information that should be provided to you as the director of the FBI. Do you believe that the Department of Justice and the FBI have a duty of candor to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court? 
COMEY: Yes, very much. 
ERNST: Do you believe they have a duty to present this type of exculpatory evidence to the court? 
COMEY: I think they have a duty consistent with that duty of candor to present a complete picture good and bad of all of their information. So that if they have exculpatory information, they ought to supply it. 
ERNST: Yes, they do. And, ladies and gentlemen, if you're--if you're watching this at home, and I do think that people are interested in this, they want to know and believe in the FBI, they want to know and believe in the DOJ. So for those folks that are watching at home, this isn't about political retribution or sour grapes. 
This is about a coordinated effort by your government--our government to influence politics, using compromised, foreign-intelligence actors. And I think this is a very, very sad example of what could absolutely go wrong in our government. 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
GRAHAM: Senator Booker. 
BOOKER: Check one, two. Ah, got it. Thank you. Sorry, think I would have been here long enough to get this to work. 
You know, I still find myself concerned about the priorities of this committee, given that elections have already begun, and we have a real, urgent, ongoing crisis. Director Comey, this committee has already spent a lot of time investigating an investigation that's already been investigated and I'm pretty confident will continue to be investigated. It's been cleared by the Justice Department's Inspector General already and I understand and honor the interest to continue with the investigation of the investigation. 
But I--I just really think that given the existential threat to our current election processes, the dangers of that we have the real substantive dangers of imminent violence, the real substantive dangers of the undermining of an ongoing election, that we should be focused on that. And so I want to switch gears and really focus in on what I think are alarming and disturbing comments made by President Trump last night when he yet again refuse to condemn white supremacists and calling on one group to quote, ""Stand back and stand by."" 
In August 2019, Director Comey you published an op-ed in The New York Times about how President Trump was deliberately fanning the flames of racism in America. Here's what you wrote and if I can quote it to you, ""Every American president knowing what lies deep within our country, bears a unique responsibility to say loudly and consistently that white supremacy is illegitimate. That encouraging a politics of racial resentment can spawn violence and that violence aimed at people by virtue of their skin color is terrorism."" 
Director Comey, what does it mean for the president of the United States to call on the Proud Boys, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated as a hate group that regularly expresses white nationalist views to stand back and stand by. 
COMEY: It lifts the kettle rocks (SP) in the basement of our amazing country has always been a small amount of radioactive stew and we've controlled that racist stew with law and with culture. And when the president of the United States starts talking that way about that kind of group he's pulling out of that radioactive stew, the control rods that we've used for 50 years to suppress racist violence. It is a deeply disturbing development and I hope no matter what your politics are, you see it the same way. 
BOOKER: And just to put a sharp edge on this, sir. Since 911, is it true that the majority of our domestic terrorist actions killing American lives everywhere from a church in South Carolina to a synagogue in Pittsburgh, the majority of our murders--terroristic murders in this country have been done by right-wing organizations? 
COMEY: That's my understanding of the data. 
BOOKER: Domestic terrorism, domestic right-wing organizations feeding hatred and bigotry. And so how do these shameful comments of the president of the United States, his outright refusal to condemn white supremacy--dangerous white supremacy affect the psychology of groups like the Proud Boys and other violent extremist--extremist groups like them, other--other white nationalist groups that we have seen conducting carry out such violence? How does it affect the psychology of these groups? 
COMEY: It gives them license and it makes them cool in the eyes of the people who make up that radioactive stew. And so it will attract more people to their warped view of the world and to their groups. It is--it is a free pass to people that nobody wants in their communities. And I don't know whether today the president has tried to correct what he said but I would sure hope he would. 
BOOKER: And, Director Comey, you're not alone. You are not the first FBI Director nor the last FBI director to state plainly the dangers of white supremacy of this kind of violence. Your successor, FBI Director Christopher Wray, recently testified that, quote, ""Racially motivated violent extremism, primarily carried out by white supremacists account for the majority of domestic terroristic threats."" This is a imminent threat as a president seems to be calling to such groups to stand by, who a president who has explicitly said if he loses this election, it will be an illegitimate election, a president who has explicitly failed to commit himself to the peaceful transfer of power. 
And so how do President Trump's statements about these groups affect the FBI's ability to address this threat? 
COMEY: The FBI is fighting a fire of racist violence and with words like that, the president is using a fire hose to spray gasoline on that fire. And as I--maybe he misspoke, maybe when he said stand down and stand by, he meant something else. I sure hope for the sake of our whole country he'll say that today what he really meant to condemn these groups. 
BOOKER: But, sir, do you see the connection to the election that is ongoing right now and where we are less than 35 days away from that election, do you have cause for--not just concern but real alarm about these groups being incited and motivated by the words of the president of the United States towards violent actions? 
COMEY: Yes, that's what I meant by using my only metaphor of spraying gasoline with a fire hose. It creates a dangerous place for all of us, not just people of color. But for every community in America that has these--these thugs and criminals, have a presence there ought to worry about this. And the president of the United States should be charged with tamping it down, not letting it free. 
BOOKER: So here we are in the United States of America, where the current FBI Director, where the past FBI Director are both saying unequivocally that we are facing a--a threat of domestic terrorism. And clearly saying that the words of the president of the United States is not calming, is not unifying, it's not bringing us together, it's not condemning this. It's actually inciting it to use your words, that is spraying gasoline on the fires of hatred going into an election, where he has literally, specifically talking to people inviting them to potentially do things like show up at polling sites to take action, to stand by. 
I don't understand how we don't see this as what it is. That we are on the verge of seeing a real threat to our fundamental democratic ideals and the smooth election processes to which has been, frankly, a hallmark of our country in our recent history. This is a dangerous moment in time. It is a frightening moment in time. And we know from what happened in San Antonio, Texas, and a number of other occasions, that people who are carrying out these actions are invoking the words of the president of the United States in their hateful, violent actions. This is a frightening time for America. 
And for us not to be assembling the united bipartisan will have this judiciary committee or the bipartisan will of the United States Senate to act against this when we have seen the agony of what happened in South Carolina and an African American church, the agony of what happened in San Antonio Walmart, the agony of what happened in a synagogue in Pittsburgh, and so many other occasions when hate crimes are on a rise. 
I--it is shameful that we are doing nothing. The only thing necessary for evil to be triumphant is for good people to do nothing. Your metaphor, the president of the United States last night sprayed gasoline on the fires of hate. Our inaction right now, on the eve of this contentious election means that we are standing by and letting this arsonist that is our president continue to menace to democracy we all cherish. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. The democracy we all cherish depends upon law and order, depends on truth-telling. It depends upon the system being fair to those who are accused. It depends upon courts being informed of exculpatory information. That is what this hearing's about. And we will continue with these type hearings to get to the bottom of how this got so off the rails so it never happens again. 
Senator Kennedy. 
KENNEDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. Comey, have you ever heard the expression power doesn't change people it just unmasks them? 
COMEY: No, I don't think so. 
KENNEDY: How's your book coming? How many copies have you sold? 
COMEY: I don't know. A lot. I have a new one coming out in January about the Justice Department. I hope that'll sell a lot too but I don't know. I don't know the numbers. 
KENNEDY: You--you enjoy attention, don't you, Mr. Comey? 
COMEY: I do not. I enjoy attention from my family. I do not enjoy being recognized in public and B-list celebrity fame, which I hope will go away very soon. 
KENNEDY: Well, I'll give you this. You have been an equal opportunity egotist. You have tried to screw both Trump and Clinton. 
You--and let's talk about Clinton first. When you were head of the FBI, you investigated Secretary Clinton and her emails and her server, did you not? 
COMEY: The FBI team did while(PH) I was director. Yes. 
KENNEDY: And you concluded that there were no criminal violations, did you not? 
COMEY: There were no violations that a reasonable prosecutor would pursue. 
KENNEDY: But you didn't just issue a statement, you called a press conference and you--you commented on her behavior. You said she was extremely care--careless but in your opinion, there was no criminal intent. What were you thinking of? I mean, this is--this is the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. Didn't you realize that could have an impact on the investigation? 
COMEY: The investigation was ending at that point when I issued the summary of what we-- 
KENNEDY: --Sorry, I misspoke. Didn't you realize that could have an impact on the election? 
COMEY: Potentially, sure. And I was trying to offer-- 
KENNEDY: --I'm sorry, go ahead. 
COMEY: I was trying to offer transparency about the justification for ending an investigation of intense interest the American people in July--it's July 5th of 2016. 
KENNEDY: Oh, you gave us a full dose of transparency. Eleven days before the election, you sent a letter to Congress saying, ""Never mind what I said in my press conference, my unprecedented press conference. I'm going to reopen the investigation,"" didn't you? 
COMEY: Correct. I didn't say what you just said in the letter but I told the chairs of the committees we're reopening the investigation to examine some additional material. 
KENNEDY: And then a few days later, right before the election, you said, never mind. She didn't do anything. 
COMEY: No, I said the examination was completed and it doesn't change our view. 
KENNEDY: And this is--we're not talking about a parking ticket here. We're talking about the Democratic nominee for president of the United States. The most powerful person in the free world. And you didn't think that would have an impact on the election? 
COMEY: Oh, I knew it could potentially have an impact no matter what we did. 
KENNEDY: And you don't like attention? 
COMEY: Yes, both of those things are true at the same time. Sometimes you have to make hard decisions and you don't like attention. 
KENNEDY: Let's talk about Trump. 
You didn't really care about Dr. Page, did you? You wanted Trump, didn't you? 
COMEY: That is not accurate. 
KENNEDY: Yeah. When--when you--when you went and got these warrants to investigate Dr. Page that--that you don't remember much about, what did that allow you to do? Could you follow him around? 
COMEY: (INAUDIBLE) I didn't send or get any warrants. The investigative team and the lawyers in DOJ got-- 
KENNEDY: --Right. Could you follow him around with--with--with the authority from FISA? 
COMEY: No, you didn't need authority from FISA to follow someone around. This is about electronic surveillance. 
KENNEDY: Okay. You can wiretap him? 
COMEY: It allowed you to collect electronic communications that he was engaged in. 
KENNEDY: You can wiretapping(PH). 
COMEY: Yeah, that's the old fashioned term. But yes, it gave you authority to collect electronic communications. Almost nobody uses-- 
KENNEDY: --Could you bug him? 
COMEY: I don't think there was authority in the FISA application for a remote listening device. 
KENNEDY: Did you open his mail? 
COMEY: I don't think that was included either. 
KENNEDY: But you don't remember? 
COMEY: I don't-- it's easy to figure out but I don't, sitting here I don't. 
KENNEDY: Okay, that's fair. And--and you're saying today that--that--that if you knew now what you didn't know then that you wouldn't have signed the--the--the application? 
COMEY: I would not have signed the narrow certification that the FBI director has to give but more importantly, I would want to know from the team, how are you thinking about this? Why are these things not being included? 
KENNEDY: Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm--I mean, you're a smart guy, you're honors graduate, William and Mary, Chicago Law School, and you don't like attention. And I'm trying to understand this. You're investigating--now you're investigating the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Okay, you've already finished with the Democratic nominee-- 
COMEY: (INAUDIBLE) 
KENNEDY: --their Republican nominee and you're--you've got a FISA warrant that was a lie. And you say, well, wouldn't--your head of the FBI, didn't you check? Didn't you go, ""Hey, guys, this is the--this is a nominee from the president of the United States. Let's sit down and talk about what's your evidence."" You never did that? 
COMEY: Senator, we were never investigating the candidate--the Republican candidate, Mr. Trump. This is about a surveillance warrant on someone who was no longer associated with the campaign. 
KENNEDY: Oh, you just got his name out of the--out of the White Pages? 
COMEY: Whose name? 
KENNEDY: And then with General Flynn, you've wrapped up your investigation but you decided to take one more shot. Sally Yates says you went rogue. Isn't that accurate? 
COMEY: It is not. 
KENNEDY: Well, why would she say that? She sure didn't compliment you. I was sitting right here, bigger than Dallas listening to her. She said you went rogue. 
COMEY: Did you ask me what she meant by that? 
KENNEDY: Yeah. What do you think about that? 
COMEY: I think she was disappointed that I didn't coordinate the Flynn interview with her in advance and I understood her concern about that. I think she understood my explanation afterwards as to why I used my authority, which I had, to do it without coordinating. 
KENNEDY: But you don't like attention? 
COMEY: I stand by my earlier answer. I love attention from my grandchildren and my children and my wife. The rest of it, I could let politicians have it. 
KENNEDY: Can we agree that the FBI is the premier law enforcement agency in all of human history? 
COMEY: I think so. At risk of offending DEA, I think so. 
KENNEDY: Mr. Comey, if you had chosen a different career, say a driving instructor, and you'd never pursued a career at the FBI. Don't you think the FBI would be better off? 
COMEY: I didn't pursue a career at the FBI. I was very happily teaching at Columbia when I was asked to become FBI director. 
GRAHAM: That's enough. So we'll go to our--next Senator Blackburn after that. Are you aware that Mr. Barnett, who is the lead investigator of the Flynn case recently said that he did not believe there was a crime involving General Flynn? 
COMEY: I read his 302 and I think it does say that he thought that before January 5th or before Flynn was interviewed. 
GRAHAM: So how normal is it for the lead investigator to believe that the person he's investigating didn't commit a crime and went so far as to say they thought the whole team was out to get Trump? Is that a normal thing in the FBI? Is that something the court should consider as to whether or not this is legitimate prosecution? 
COMEY: I think Mr. Barnett was confusing the nature of the investigation, which is a little bit concerning if he was working on it. It was a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. 
GRAHAM: So here's the point, Mr. Comey, you set a plan up to get prosecuted. This was a counterintelligence investigation and there was no there--there. This man was the incoming national security adviser. He had every reason in the world to be talking to the Russians about changing policy. But this whole rogue thing, setting up an interview in the White House, going around normal procedures bothered a lot of people. 
Are you aware that agents felt that the investigation was conducted so poorly, that they had to buy liability insurance or thought about buying liability insurance? 
COMEY: I did not. Though I thought all FBI agents-- 
GRAHAM: --I just want the public to know this was so bad by the people involved, they felt like they needed to buy liability insurance. That the man involved investigating General Flynn didn't believe the man committed a crime and what they charged him with was giving false information about a contact with the Russian ambassador when he was the national security adviser which was on tape. And when Mr. Barnett looked at the Kislyak (SP) interaction he said, ""I haven't changed my mind."" I think that's why the Department of Justice is so upset with the plan prosecution. 
Senator Blackburn. 
BLACKBURN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Comey, we thank you for coming. We appreciate having your time. 
You know, this is our day three hearing. We have talked with Rod Rosenstein, we have also had the opportunity to talk with Sally Yates. And, yes, in her testimony, she did say that she thought you went rogue on this situation and that is of concern for us. And one of the reasons we wanted to hear from you today. 
And I will tell you this, as I talk to Tennesseans, one of the things that they're trying to figure out is quite simply this, somebody cooked up this plot, they came up with this, and then somebody gave the order to carry this bought out, and somebody did the dirty work. But then when you talk to Rosenstein and Yates and now hearing from you, basically what you say is you didn't know anything about any of this and you did not know any of this was going on. So why don't you tell us who came up with this plot? And then who gave the order to carry this out? 
COMEY: What plot are you talking about, Senator? 
BLACKBURN: Spying on the president. 
COMEY: There was no spying on the president. 
BLACKBURN: You say there was no spying. There was no problems with Carter Page, getting that face a warrant. There was no problems with Papadopoulos. There was no problem with General Flynn, you're saying that you had just cause for every bit of that, even though as the chairman just said and as Senator Kennedy said, your goal was to get to the president, right? 
COMEY: I'm not sure I understand what your question is. 
BLACKBURN: Well, that is not surprising to me. Let me ask you. This-- the books that you're writing, would we find those as fiction or nonfiction? 
COMEY: Nonfiction. 
BLACKBURN: Nonfiction. Okay. I guess you've got plenty of facts in there that are footnoted and can back you up, right? 
COMEY: Sure and you can read the IG report and the Muller Report in the Senate Intelligence Committee report. 
BLACKBURN: Let's talk about that IG report, as a matter of fact. I think it's interesting because when the IG report really contradicted your statements. You claimed that the FBI did not spy on the Trump campaign in 2017 and the IG report contradicted you on that. 
COMEY: Is that a question? 
BLACKBURN: Yes, sir. What do you have to say about that? 
COMEY: I'm not aware that there's a contradiction on that point in the IG report. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. You're not aware of that. All right. 
I assume that you're aware of the article that was posted to The Washington Post under your byline in May 28th, 2019. James Comey, No Treason, No Coup, Just allies and Dumb Lies. You recall that article? 
COMEY: Yes, Senator. I wrote that. 
BLACKBURN: Oh, you did write that. Okay. And do you still stand by that article because it alleges that Joseph Mifsud was a Russian agent? 
COMEY: Yeah, that's right. I think the Intelligence Committee found that he was representing Russian interests in communicating with Papadopoulos. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. All right. And so you're standing by that article. 
COMEY: I haven't read it since May of 2019. But I think it was--I got nothing I can think of now that I want to change. 
BLACKBURN: And okay, and nothing has changed your opinions? 
COMEY: I, again, I don't know what the opinions are that you're asking me about. But I don't know anything about something I wrote in May of 2019 that I would change. 
BLACKBURN: And if somebody wants to know your opinions, they can buy one of your books, right? 
COMEY: Or read The Post or come to this hearing. 
BLACKBURN: Yep. I have to go back to this about who came up with this plot to carry all of this out. We have seen all these emails, the communications between Strzok and Page. We have seen--we've read the IG report. We know there were things that seemed to be conveniently overlooked. And it is astounding to me that as the head of the premier law enforcement agency, you, Rosenstein, and Yates knew absolutely nothing. 
But then you knew enough to go to the January 5th meeting in the Oval Office. Did you call that meeting? Or did either President Obama or Vice President Biden call that meeting? 
COMEY: I don't know who called it. I was asked to come to the White House for that meeting for the briefing on the 5th of January. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. You were asked to come. And who issued the invitation to you to attend that? 
COMEY: I don't know. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. Who mentioned the Logan Act and using that against General Flynn? 
COMEY: Nobody that I recall at the White House. I remember discussing it at the FBI but not at the White House. 
BLACKBURN: With the FBI. Okay. 
And then what were--Peter Strzok's notes as later relayed to him by you, what did President Obama mean by instructing you to make sure that you had the right people on it? 
COMEY: I don't know what Peter Strzok's notes reflect. I haven't talked to him about them. And I don't remember using those--hearing those words, and President Obama or using them with Peter Strzok. I remember the president saying do this in the normal way. It was the way I understood him. 
BLACKBURN: Okay. All right. So still, there is a veil of vagueness that is around your recollections and your memory when it comes to these incidences. Do you have any regrets? 
COMEY: My memory is pretty good. I don't tend to remember exact words unless I write them down. I remember the words of my marriage vows even though it was 1987. I don't remember specific words that were used during that January 5th meeting because I can write a memo about it afterwards. 
BLACKBURN: You know, Mr. Comey, I call that selective memory. You choose to remember certain things and you choose to be vague about other things. About one of the things that we do know is the--the American people have been deeply troubled by the fact that the FBI could have conducted themselves in this way. That the DOJ could have been involved in this. They want to trust the institutions of their government. 
They see someone in you who is very arrogant, who is very dismissive and is very condescending to the concerns that they have about the structure of government in the American taxpayer. They're paying the paycheck for every single person that is in that DOJ and that FBI and they expect their best efforts. And according to Mrs. Yates, you did not give those best efforts you chose to go rogue. 
I yield back. 
GRAHAM: Thank you. Mr. Comey. I really appreciate you coming. today. You didn't have to do this. You chose to do it and I want to thank you. Mr. Comey, you still there? 
COMEY: Yeah, I'm here. 
GRAHAM: Okay. Yeah. So I want to thank you for coming and we'll wrap this up. Is it fair to say that knowing what we know now, Crossfire Hurricane was not done by the book? 
COMEY: No. That's not fair to say. 
GRAHAM: Okay. That is fair to say it was not done by the book, right? 
COMEY: No, I'm disagreeing with you. My answer--you asked me if you think I think in the main (INAUDIBLE) 
GRAHAM: Well, God help us all my friend if this is by the book. God help the United States of America if this was done by the book because it was such an egregious violation of fairness, altering exculpatory information, failing to tell the court the unreliability of information before the court that was outcome determined at the beginning a warrant against an American citizen. If this is by the book, we need to rewrite the book. And I promise you, we will. 
Thank you very, very much for coming, and thank you. 
Now, what will we be doing next, this committee will be going down the ladder of who signed the warrant application to get a FISA warrant against Carter Page. We've had Rosenstein--Rosenstein, who was the acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who is the acting attorney general for this--the number two at DOJ when it was--she was in charge. Both say I would not have signed the warrant application if I knew then what I know now regarding Mr. Carter Page. 
Now we have the FBI director who came into the hearing today and said the three times he signed the application against Carter Page he would not have signed it knowing what he knows now--knowing them what he knows now. 
So where are we headed McCabe is next. He was the number two at the FBI. What am I worried about the men--to the public? I'm worried that we're going to blame this on some low-level people. Somebody is got to be blamed for withholding exculpatory information from a court that would have saved an American citizen a lot of grief. 
Somebody's got to be blamed by using a document prepared by a foreign agent on the payroll of the Democratic Party, who hired a Russian agent to create a document called a dossier that was full of falsehoods that led to the obtaining of a warrant against a member of the opposition party's campaign team. Somebody has to pay that price. Because if they don't, we will keep doing this again. If it can happen to a Republican, it can happen to a Democrat. 
So what do I see here? Everybody at the top saying, not me? How's it possible that the director of the FBI and one of the most important cases in the history of the FBI was not made aware of the fact that the CIA called the dossier, their critical document to get a warrant against Carter Page, internet rumor. How'a it possible that he did not know that the primary sub-source was a single individual, suspected by the FBI of being a Russian agent? 
How is it possible he wasn't informed by people in the FBI, after two interviews in January and March of the Russian sub-source, the Russian agent, that the dossier was barred talk hearsay, you need to take it with a grain of salt, that none of that made it into the next war and application in April, none of that made it to the top of the FBI? How is it possible something this important to the country that is not remotely possible to me that the case falls apart, and nobody tells anybody at the top? 
So to those who found this out, that interviewed the sub-source, to those who were made aware that the sub-source was a potential Russian agent, they want to hang you with this. If you didn't tell the court, then you're in trouble. If you didn't inform your superiors, you're in trouble because there's a duty to catch up candor to the court. So those of you who knew that the dossier wasn't reliable, was internet rumor, who had information that the sub-source disavowed the reliability of the document, and you didn't tell anybody about it, you need to be fired or you're subject going to jail. If you did tell somebody, then you've done your job. 
But here's where we're headed, apparently. In one of the most corrupt investigations in modern history involving the nominee of the Republican Party, where the FBI used a document prepared by a foreign agent, Christopher Steele, who hired a Russian spy to create a document to get a warrant against American citizen about activities in Russia that were Russian disinformation, at least in part, that we end this whole drama was saying these things just happen. Nobody at the top really needs to be held accountable. Other than well, yes, my fault intellectually. Somebody needs to be fired or go to jail. 
Mr. Clinesmith is pleading guilty to alternate document that it was exculpatory to Mr. Page. Without the dossier, there would be no warrant against Carter Page because all the Russian contacts could be explained if you understood Mr. Page had been working with the CIA, something the FBI knew and failed to tell the court. He went through hell because of the dossier. Not one person has been prosecuted for colluding with the Russians in the Trump world. 
Why does the Ratcliffe revelations matter? The director of the FBI was informed by the intelligence community in September of 2016 that there was a plot being cooked up by the Clinton campaign to accuse Trump of being involved with the Russians to distract from her email server problem and the FBI Director doesn't remember that interaction. Here's the question. Do you think if this information involved Trump, they would have done something about it? I've looked in the file. I can't find any evidence they took it serious. Doesn't matter if it's reliable or not. 
The question is, did the FBI pursue evidence against the Clinton campaign with the same vigor they did the Trump campaign. Can you imagine what the media would be saying today if this revelation or about Trump? Can you imagine how breathless it would be if the FBI just ignored it? Would--can you imagine how this would be portraying on the newspapers and TV networks of this country if the Republican Party had hired Christopher Steele, who hired a Russian agent, to investigate the Clinton campaign to get a dossier on Clinton, accusing her of horrible things that were all Russian disinformation, hearsay, innuendo to the American media? 
You gave Muller a lot of coverage. I supported the Mueller investigation because I think it was important that we run these allegations down. Where there's accusations about the integrity of our elections, about the role of Russia, we should all be concerned. But now that we know--now that we know that the Carter Page fiasco was an effort by a political party to create a document to get--to be used against an American citizen weaponizing political research. 
Nobody seems to care. My colleagues talk about everything but the issue before us. I care. I supported legislation protecting Mueller from being fired. Why? Because I cared. I agree with the following, if the Democrats were in charge, we wouldn't be having this hearing. The Horowitz Report, 17 violations of protocol and policy regarding the Carter Page warrant application. Thank God for Mr. Horowitz. 
We have found more even more stunning violations. The House Judiciary Committee has declared war on the Trump administration every way you can including impeaching him but they have yet to hold a hearing with Mr. Horowitz. This committee has said hearings about Russian involvement in our election, about their methods and their manes, we called Sally Yates and Clapper to tell us about their concerns about Flynn at a time when people didn't know. 
So I want to end with this about the Flynn matter. It is not normal, ladies and gentlemen, that the agent involved investigating a case, Mr. Barnett, felt like that there was no crime, and the man gets prosecuted anyway. It's not normal for the agent in charge of investigating a case to believe that the organization was out to get a particularly individual and in this case, Trump. This is not normal. 
The Flynn case is not normal. The people in the field wanted to drop it. They kept pushing it. They manufacture their crime against General Flynn. He was not colluding with the Russians. He had every reason in the world to be talking to Mr. Kislyak, the ambassador to Russia because he was going to be the incoming national security adviser. It is not normal, that the FBI takes a politically contrived document from a Russian agent, paid for by the Democratic Party, and use it against an American citizen. That is not normal. 
Somebody needs to be held accountable for this. Not only is it not normal, it is incredibly dangerous. So what will we do in this committee? We will keep moving forward. I'm going to call everybody who signed the warrant application and ask them if you knew then what you know now would you have signed the warrant application against Carter Page? And oh, by the way, how's it possible that the people in charge seemed to know nothing about egregious abuses in one of the most important cases in the history of the FBI? 
Stay tuned. "

 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY 
NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER MILLER 
[*]THOMPSON: The committee on homeland security will come to order. As I said, the committee on homeland security will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare the committee in recess at any point. 
Good morning. Before we begin I want to say our thoughts are with those Americans dealing with devastating natural disasters, including the wildfires in the West and Hurricane Sally in the South. As chairman, I remain committed to ensuring they receive the federal help needed to respond, recover, and build back stronger. Today the Committee On Homeland Security is meeting for its annual he hearing on worldwide threats to the homeland. 
Our nation recently observed the 19th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Nearly two decades later, we continue to mourn the nearly 3000 lives lost that terrible day and keep their loved ones in our prayers. This committee and the Department of Homeland Security were established in the wake of 9/11 to help prevent future attacks on our soil. Regardless of who was chairman, we have held regular hearings examining worldwide threats with leaders from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, and National Counterterrorism Center, and regardless of who occupy the White House, whether Democrat or Republican, we have received cooperation in that effort. Today was supposed to be no different. 
Unfortunately as we see from the empty chair in front of us, Mr. Chad Wolf is not here to represent the Department of Homeland Security. Let me be clear about how we got here. The committee began engaging with the department over three months ago on June 10, 2020, to secure Mr. Wolf's participation in this hearing on alongside his colleagues from the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center. Any assertion that the administration committed to having DHS, FBI and NCTC testify before this committee at a worldwide threats hearing in July is false. 
DHS tentatively offered a couple of dates but then could not agree with its FBI and NCTC counterparts on the date for the hearing in June or July. In fact, it was the Department of Homeland Security that conveyed to the committee that September 17 was the earliest Mr. Wolf would be available to testify at this hearing. In the interest of receiving Mr. Wolf's testimony, the committee agreed to the offer date. 
It was not until last week that the department informed the committee that Mr. Wolf would be reneging on the commitment to testify in anticipation of being nominated for Secretary of Homeland Security. I would note that despite his refusal to testify today, Mr. Wolf has spoken to the media on multiple occasions since President Trump announced he intended to nominate Mr. Wolf to be Secretary of Homeland Security, including no fewer than four appearances on Fox News. 
Mr. Wolf has run the Department of Homeland Security for the last ten months and has been responsible for numerous directly relevant to the subjects the committee intends to explore. With that in mind, last week, I wrote Mr. Wolf to make clear that there is no legal prohibition baring--barring a nominee's testimony and to urge him to honor his commitment. In response, the department again declined to provide Mr. Wolf to testify at this hearing. 
Faced with a continued refusal on Friday, I issued a subpoena for his appearance in accordance with House and committee rules; regrettably, he has chosen to defy the subpoena. That he would refuse to come to share after committing to do so should appall every member of this committee. Insisting Mr. Wolf keep his commitment to testifying before Congress is playing politics, it is doing our job. Congress has the authority and obligation to execute its constitutional oversight responsibilities regarding Mr. Wolf's decision and the department's action during his tenure. As chairman, it is my responsibility to ensure the committee fulfills its constitutional responsibilities. 
19 years after the attacks of 9/11, we continue to face grave threats to the homeland, including the rise of domestic terrorism, ongoing foreign interference in the 2020 elections, and the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed nearly 200,000 American lives. As a person running the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Wolf should be here to testify as secretaries of Homeland Security have done before. Instead, we have an empty chair, an appropriate metaphor for the Trump administration's dereliction on so many of these critical homeland security issues. 
Mr. Wolf may attempt to evade oversight, and the department may try silly stunts to distract from this hearing, but we will not waiver the stakes are just too high. Indeed former department officials, the administration's own political appointees, are coming forward to sound the alarm that our nation's security is being compromised in favor of the president's political interests. Americans who care about securing the homeland and upholding our most sacred values expect their representatives to hold the Department of Homeland Security and this administration accountable. 
The issue that under my chairmanship, I will not waiver in my commitment to doing so today or in the future. To that end, I am pleased that Director Wray and Director Miller are here today. I look forward to their testimony and the members' questions. The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers, for an opening statement. 
ROGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I started, I wanted to acknowledge our newest member of the committee, Mr. Garcia, who I know is going to be a great addition to our committee's work in the future. 
Since the heinous attacks of September 11, we have made great strides to thwart global jihadist operations and to stop threats before they reach our shores. However, today global jihadist are joined by cyber hackers, rival nation-states, and transnational organizations. Together they present incredible new risks to our economy, our safety, and our way of life. 
Make no mistake the threats to our homeland have never been more real than they are today. That is why it is important that we, as members of this committee, understand those threats. It is our job to ensure that DHS, FBI, and our intelligence community have the resources and authorities they need to continue to dismantle terrorist organizations and protect our homeland. I look forward to hearing more about the administration--how the administration is countering the threat from Al Qaeda, China, and Iran and others who seek to do us harm. 
Mr. Chairman, I'm also disappointed DHS is not here today, but I want the record to be very clear on why DHS is not represented. It is not the fault of the department or this administration; Acting Secretary Wolf offered to testify before this committee in both July and August. Unfortunately, the majority refused to make either of those dates work. Now due to his nomination, Mr. Wolf is prohibited from testifying under a policy that has been in place under both Republican and Democrat administrations for decades. 
Nevertheless due to the significance of today's hearing the department offered to have Mr. Cuccinelli testify. He is the second highest ranking official at DHS and perfectly qualified and informed on today's subject matter. And I ask unanimous consent to include his testimony for the record. 
THOMPSON: Without objection. 
ROGERS: Thank you. He should be here today providing the department's perspective on those threats we face and--and what DHS is doing to counter them, but instead of having productive hearing with Mr. Cuccinelli, the chairman chose to subpoena and then empty chair Mr. Wolf. This is a political stunt huge disservice to our committee and to the public. This is the single most important hearing we hold in this committee but unfortunately, as with most things this Congress, the majority has chosen to play politics. 
As a result, the public is being deprived of critical information from DHS. Perhaps that's the real reason why this majority didn't want Mr. Cuccinelli here. Having the public hear about all of the good things DHS is doing to protect them might undermine the radical left's-- 
[*]ROGERS: --rallying cry, dismantle DHS. Unfortunately, Director Wray and Director Miller are here--I'm sorry. Fortunately, Director Wray and Director Miller are here to provide us with their valuable perspective. I look forward to hearing from both of you on--about the threats we are facing. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The committee does not want to hear testimony from the Department. Therefore, after Mr. Wolf declined our invitation, we issued a subpoena to obtain his testimony. The so-called standard of practice by which the department says Mr. Wolf cannot testify his administration's own self-imposed limitation. 
I also note that this is an administration whose respect for so-called precedence and even laws is highly situational. If the minority wanted to hear testimony from Mr. Cuccinelli, they had every right to invite him to appear as their witness at this hearing today. I'm not aware of the minority's requesting his testimony. 
Other members of the committee are reminded that under committee rules, opening statements may be suspended for the record. Members are also reminded that the subcommittees will operate according to the guidelines laid out by myself and ranking members in our July 8th colloquy. 
I welcome our panel of witnesses here at our first witness is the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher Wray. Director Wray began his law enforcement career in 1997 serving in numerous positions at the Justice Department before assuming his current role in 2017. 
Next, we have the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christopher Miller. Director Miller served in the United States military from 1983 to 2014 and in numerous civilian national security roles before assuming his current position. Without objection, the witnesses full statement will be inserted in the record. I now ask each witness to summarize his statement in five minutes or the best you can do within that time beginning with Director Wray. 
WRAY: Good morning, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Rogers, and members of the committee. I'm honored to be here today on behalf of the men and women of the FBI to discuss our nation's top threads from the FBI's perspective and what we're doing to counter those threats. 
I know we all share a lot of the same concerns about topics ranging from international and domestic terrorism, to cyber security, to the violence in our streets and particularly this year, to the threat of foreign influence in our elections, and that's just to name a few. And I look forward to updating you on these and other important topics this morning. 
But I'd like to begin by covering quickly a few items that had been particularly top of mind for us at the FBI over the past few weeks. First, terrorism remains the FBI's top priority, although the nature of that threat has evolved significantly since 9/11. We are ever vigilant in our efforts to prevent attacks by international terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS. Those groups pose a threat not just to Americans overseas, but also here at home, most notably by those we call homegrown violent extremists, often lone actors inspired by foreign terrorists, self-radicalized online and motivated to attack soft targets with readily available weapons. 
We're also working around the clock to prevent attacks by domestic terrorists who are inspired by one or more extremist ideologies to commit violent acts. In recent years, we've been laser focused on threats by racially or ethnically motivated violent extreme lists. They too are often radicalized online and mobilized quickly to carry out their violent plans. People like Richard Holzer who our Denver joint terrorism task force arrested on hate crime charges just last year while he was planning to blow up a synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado. 
As with any terrorism case, we are focused on disruption, on making arrests before a criminal can act. Just this year alone through the hard work and dedication of countless men and women both at the FBI and across our partner agencies, we've successfully thwarted potential terrorist attacks in Kansas City, Tampa, Cleveland, Oklahoma City, Boston, Phoenix, and other locations. Now in recent months, we've witnessed protests in various places around the country and member many members of Congress have raised questions about those protests. Although the majority of protesters have been peaceful, we have opened investigations on individuals involved in criminal activity at these protests, some of whom adhere to violent extremist agendas designed to sow discord and upheaval. 
Now, let me be clear, we do not investigate groups or individuals based on ideology or the exercise the First Amendment protected activity alone. But the ideology leads someone to commit criminal acts and pursue violence, the FBI will not hesitate to take appropriate action. That's why we've been working closely with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure the safety of all of our citizens, including, I should say, the safety of those trying to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully. 
We in law enforcement must keep our communities safe and secure while safeguarding our citizens' constitutional rights and civil liberties. And as I've said before, one of those need not and must not come at the expense of the other. 
We also remain focused on other threats. In less than two months, of course, Americans will exercise one of their most cherished rights, to vote in a free and fair election. Americans must have confidence in our voting system and our election infrastructure. That's why the security of our elections is and will continue to be one of our highest priorities. We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections. And we are working closely with our federal, state, and local partners as well as the private sector to share information, bolster security, and identify and disrupt any threat. Just recently, for example, we shared threat indicators with both Facebook and Twitter that allowed them to takedown fake accounts created as part of a Russian disinformation campaign before those accounts could develop a broader following. 
Turning to the cyber arena, we are focused on an increasingly diverse array of threats from our cyber adversaries from state sponsored cyber intrusions by nation states like China, Russia, Iran, entered North Korea to sophisticated cybercriminals seeking to exploit technical vulnerabilities primarily for personal profit. Just yesterday, I announced the FBI's new cyber strategy leveraging our unique expertise and authorities to impose risk and consequences on our cyber adversaries. 
We are focusing on results, and that means we are working to enable our partners operations as well as our own. So to take one example, the FBI and NSA recently joined to expose highly sophisticated Russian military and intelligence malware providing the private sector and other government partners the indicators they need to disrupt that tool. 
We also face the increasingly blended threat of state sponsored economic espionage facilitated by cyber intrusions. In July, based on the FBI's investigative work, DOJ indicted two Chinese hackers working with the ministry of state security for carrying out a global computer intrusion campaign that targeted hundreds of victims, including, I should note, companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing technology, and treatment. 
With that kind of behavior, China continues to undercut their own claims of being a trusted and effective partner of the international community. Just yesterday, we unsealed charges against five Chinese hackers who were targeting victims around the world from their safe haven in China. With our partners, we've now arrested two of their coconspirators in Malaysia and it seized or took down hundreds of the hackers accounts, servers, and domains. 
Now, I've touched on only a handful of the important threats we face and only quickly at that. And of course, there aren't many significant others. As the threats evolved in scale, impact, complexity, and agility, we are relying on our deep well of expertise, intelligence, and partnerships. I'm committed to ensuring that the bureau does great work while adhering to our core tenants of fidelity, bravery, and integrity. 
In these challenging times, I told my folks then we got to keep call and to tackle hard, remaining faithful to our core values and best traditions while making sure that we are always doing the right thing in the right way. Thank you. I'm happy to take your questions. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much for your testimony. I now recognize Director Miller to summarize his statement for five minutes. 
[*]MILLER: Thank you, sir. Chairman Thompson Ranking Member Rogers, distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the global counterterrorism environment and to highlight the tireless work of the professionals of your National Counterterrorism Center. I'm truly honored and humbled to lead such an extraordinary group of patriots. 
As my statement for the record reflects, today's terrorism threat to the United States and our allies is less acute but more ideologically geographically diffuse, emanating from more groups in more places than it did in 2001. ISIS and al Qaeda operate in more than two dozen countries worldwide. Iran and its Shia allies increasingly threaten U.S. interests overseas. And lone actors, inspired by a range of ideologies, pose the primary terrorism threat on U.S. soil. 
Our focus remains defeating al Qaeda, its affiliates, and other terrorist actors while defending our shores from terrorist entry. We believe this threat picture will only grow more complex over the coming year as technological advances, changing geopolitical dynamics, and instability resulting from global pandemic create more opportunities for terrorists to benefit. 
However, the U.S. and our CT partners worldwide can exploit some of the same dynamics to our advantages. The complex landscape requires thoughtful responses that evolve along with our adversaries and we apply the lessons that we've learned in the last 19 years to adapt for the future. At the National Counterterrorism Center, we're innovating new ways of doing business to ensure we are best aligned to connect the dots amid a flood of ever-changing information. 
Through technological innovation and organizational realignments, we are positioning ourselves to mitigate the threat of today and preempts the threat of tomorrow. To do this will require greater resources to enrich our terrorist identities analysis and enhance our ability to detect and prevent terrorist travel to the United States. We also will need to invest in new data science and information technology solutions to optimize how we harness information available from our interagency partners to combat the threat. 
In addition to adaptability, an evolving terrorist threat requires vigilance, especially as other national security priorities eclipse counterterrorism in prominence and the U.S.'s physical footprint in key jihadist theaters shrinks. We believe that change--that the changing national security framework and priorities only reinforces NCTC's mandate to serve as a government's lead agency for counterterrorism threat information and analysis. 
As our interagency partners work diligently to allocate resources to address the full scope of national security challenges, we remain focused, laser focused, on leaving the government's CT enterprise to guarantee that we maintain relentless pressure on terrorist networks and preclude them from creating sanctuaries from which they can plot and project combat power. That is the essential lesson learned from our 19 years of experience in this global war on terror. 
Nearly 2 decades after 9/11, it's now more important than ever that the NCTC remains positioned to lead the fight against terrorism by building on its legacy of a vigilance and adaptation to prepare for the future. I am confident that our inter---integrative and agile model has revolutionized how the U.S. suppresses transnational threats. 
Our approach is a no fail mission. It is one the remains worthy of emulation across the federal government. But perhaps most importantly, it has allowed us to uphold our sacred commitment to protect and serve the American people. 
In closing, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and I look for your questions. 
THOMPSON: I think the witnesses for their testimony. I'll remind each member that he or she will have five minutes to question the panel. I'll now recognize myself for questions. 
Director Wray, can you, for the sake of the committee, identify what organizations propose the greatest threat from a domestic standpoint here to the homeland? Is it right ring--wing extremists, or is it left-wing, or what does your reports reflect? 
WRAY: Mr. Chairman, the--we assess that the greatest threat to the homeland, to--to us here domestically, is not one organization, certainly not when ideology, but rather lone actors, largely self radicalized online, who pursue soft targets using readily accessible weapons. And those include both domestic violent extremists of a variety of sorts as well is homegrown violent extremists who are motivated by foreign, you know, jihadist type sources. 
Those two groups as a--those two categories as a whole provide the greatest challenge and threat to us here at home, partly because--and you've often heard the expression in the past the importance of connecting the dots. Well, if you compare the threat I just described to the sort of al Qaeda sleeper cells of old, that group, the--the sleeper cells, you've got a group of people colluding, conspiring, fundraising, planning, preparing, communicating, so there's a lot of dots out there to connect if the intelligence community and law enforcement know where to connect. And it's--usually occurs over a long period of time it. 
These people, both categories, the domestic violent extremists and the homegrown violent extremists, they don't have a lot of people they're working with. They don't take a lot of planning and preparation. They can go from radicalization to mobilization in weeks, if not days. And so, the challenge of connecting the dots, working with NCTC and our other partners, is that much greater because there are that many fewer dots to connect and that much less time to do it. So, the--the time, as the experts say, from flash to bang is that much more daunting. So, that's why that's the biggest challenge to us here in the homeland. 
THOMPSON: So, when we hear officials say Antifa is the biggest threat on the left, are they being correct? 
WRAY: Well, we don't--we don't really think of threats in terms of left and right at the FBI. We're focused on the violence, not the ideology. Our domestic violent extremists include everything from racially motivated violent extremists, which we've talked about here in this committee before, I think when I testified-- 
THOMPSON: --Sure-- 
WRAY: --Last year, for example, all the way to antigovernment, anti-authority violent extremists. And that includes people ranging from anarchist violent extremists-- 
THOMPSON: --Um-hmm-- 
WRAY: --People who subscribe to Antifa or other ideologies, as well as militia types and those kinds of-- 
THOMPSON: --Right. Well, I--I think what I'm--I'm trying to reflect on is we hear from time to time that this organization by name we need to investigate. The secretary designee, if he was here, he would get asked this question, but he's not. He asked for an investigation of Antifa because they were the--the greatest threat to the homeland. And if I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying that it's really not organization so much it is ideology. And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think that's what I heard. 
WRAY: I appreciate that. We--we look at Antifa as more of an ideology or a movement that an organization. To be clear, we do have quite a number of properly predicated domestic terrorism investigations into violent anarchist extremists, any number of whom self identify with the Antifa movement. And that's part of this broader group of domestic violent extremists that I'm talking about, but it's just one part of it. We also have racially motivated violent extremists-- 
THOMPSON: --Um-hmm-- 
WRAY: --Militia types, and others. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. Can you tell me if, as of this date, you have information that Russia is trying to influence the election for 2020? 
WRAY: Yes. I think the intelligence community's consensus is that Russia continues to try to influence our election, primarily through what we would call malign foreign influence as opposed to what we saw in 2016 where there was also an effort to target election infrastructure, you know, cyber targeting. We have not seen that second part yet this year or this cycle, but we certainly have seen very active, very active-- 
[*]WRAY: --efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 through what I would call more the maligned foreign influence side of things, social media, use of proxies, state media, online journals, etc. an effort to both so divisiveness and discord and I think the intelligence community has assessed this publicly to primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment. That--that is essentially what we are seeing in 2020. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the ranking member for questions. 
ROGERS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Director Wray, the FBI I am sorry, the Department Of Justice has recently announced many FBI investigations that led to the arrest of Chinese nationals conducting highly sensitive research in the United States that have been found to be connected to the Chinese military. The growing number of these types of cases and nonpublic details of those risk raise alarm bells for me. 
I am introducing legislation this week to address China's efforts to circumvent our existing vetting procedures and take advantage of our open and world renowned education research institutions particularly those that are taxpayer-funded through government grants. What is the significance and the prevalence of this threat? 
WRAY: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the very end of your--your question. 
ROGERS: The--the Chinese nationals who are using our--our educational facilities for their research and--and stealing our intellectual property what--what is the threat, the significance of it in your view? 
WRAY: So the Chinese view themselves as in an international talent war and they recognize that American innovation and research is the envy of the world and frankly the envy of China and when they can't innovate in research themselves they send people over here in some cases legitimately but in many cases not who engage in intellectual property theft taking information American research and bringing it back to China to advance China's national security goals which has the perverse affects since a lot of this research is taxpayer-funded as essentially the perverse effect of having of American taxpayers funding China's advancement at our expense. 
ROGERS: What can Congress do to help you combat that threat? 
WRAY: Well, certainly we appreciate the Congress allocation of resources to our counterintelligence efforts. That is an important part of it. I think I publicly acknowledge that the FBI now has over 2000 counterintelligence investigations related to China, by far the biggest chunk of our counterintelligence portfolio and we are opening a new Chinese counterintelligence investigation about every 10 hours and so the scope and scale of this threat is really breathtaking and we need as many resources as we can to help everybody tackle it but it's not just a government problem. We need to work with the private sector, you mention the academic sector. I will tell you I am very encouraged by the response we have gotten from both the private sector and frankly the academic sector. 
Lately I think people in this country are starting to wake up to the threat and voluntarily undertaking appropriate measures so the Congress can be very helpful in kind of raising awareness both when you are all at home in your districts but also through your work here in Washington and highlighting the importance of a threat and communicating in the fact back to the Chinese that this is an issue that it is bipartisan that all Americans care about and that we are not going to tolerate it. 
ROGERS: So you do believe that the academic sector is sensitive to this? 
WRAY: Well, yes. It varies I will tell you significantly from university to university about how sensitive and how cooperative with us they have been but I think this is frankly one of the bright spots over the last couple of years. We have had quite a few universities, I have been to all 56 FBI field offices and I will tell you I am struck by the number of offices where universities that three or four years ago wouldn't have wanted and FBI agent anywhere near campus to some that now have office space set aside for our people and I think that is not just because they are idealistic and you know believe in the country I hope but rather its recognition that the information that is being stolen is there information. So it's about protecting their research, their professors, their hard work frankly and I think the more of that we can have the better off we will be because the FBI can't--certainly can't tackle this alone. 
ROGERS: Thank you Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentle lady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee. 
JACKSON LEE: Thank you very much Mr. Chair. To both of the witnesses we thank you for your presence and also your service to this nation. Director Wray the FBI on May 30, 2019 issued the intelligence bulletin on antigovernment identity base and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists to commit criminal, sometimes violent activity. I think you focused or made the point today in your testimony that you act more toward the ideology or you don't investigate ideology, you are determined to assess the threat to the United States. So I am interested, QAnon activity has resulted in arrest of persons planning to carry out violent acts based on the nonsense spouted in web forums and social media that form the core of QAnon beliefs. How do you characterize that organization? 
WRAY: How do I characterize QAnon? 
JACKSON LEE: QAnon activity resulted--has resulted in arrest of persons planning to carry out violent acts. How do you assess that organization as it relates to violent acts? 
WRAY: So we view QAnon as--as essentially less of an organization and more of a sort of a complex set of conspiracy theories and certainly we have had cases where that properly predicate cases involving violence where people have been motivated by some of those conspiracy theories and as you said you know we don't investigate the ideology or the conspiracy theory itself. I don't think we have seen lethal attacks involving that kind of motivation but we have certainly-- 
JACKSON LEE: So your investigations would be driven based upon any violent acts? 
WRAY: Correct. Violent--we--we--no matter what ideology or belief it is of domestic violent extremism we look at three things. One, violence or a threat of violence to, a federal crime obviously and then third the motivation that--that fuels it. If we have to have those three things to open an investigation. 
JACKSON LEE: Black Lives Matter was organized shortly after the tragic senseless death of Trey von Martin young people took to the streets asking for justice they have obviously continued their fight for justice and particularly in the wake of police shootings of African-American men and most recently of course George Floyd, my constituent, and Elijah Blake in states in this country. Do you see just on the name of Black Lives Matter and the basis of the organizing them as an extremist group intending to turn America into a socialist nation or to destroy America? 
WRAY: We don't express a view on the sort of political organization itself of Black Lives Matter. If there were people who--who follow that group or who adhere to that ideology who were then to, based on that ideology or anything else, to commit violent criminal activity then we would approach them just like we would anyone else. 
JACKSON LEE: But you are no longer pointing to black identity groups? 
WRAY: Well, I think what you are referring to and we had some good conversations in the past about this in 2017 there was briefly a product or a category that the FBI came up with that predates me-- 
JACKSON LEE: Director Wray-- 
WRAY: --about black identity extremism-- 
JACKSON LEE: Right. I just want you to say yes or no, the reason is because my time is short and I appreciate the work. I am familiar with it. The point I'm trying to make is that just the existence of Black Lives Matter and their advocacy for justice is not determined them to be disruptive socialist group trying to destroy the nation. You have not characterize them in that way? 
WRAY: We don't characterize them one--one way or the other, no. 
JACKSON LEE: Have you seen any excessive violence that can be attributable to Black Lives Matter as opposed to any other groups that may be involved in violence? 
WRAY: I--I can't think of one sitting here right now. Certainly, we have had racially motivated violent extremist cases involving 
[*]WRAY: --Involving--African American defendants who have pursued violence against, say, law enforcement and whether any of those cases involve some reference to Black Lives Matter, sitting here right now, I can't recall one, but we certainly have had cases of the first category. 
JACKSON LEE: And you've had cases with white individuals as well? 
WRAY: Absolutely. 
JACKSON LEE: With violence against officers? 
WRAY: Absolutely. 
JACKSON LEE: In particular, the one in Oakland, California, individuals Carrillo and Justus were known to have been the culprits in the shootings. Boogaloo Boys and Proud Boys. Those individuals were not involved in protests to your knowledge as Vice President Pence indicated--Pence indicated that they were involved in protests. These were quite individuals who, unfortunately, tragically shot officers Dave Patrick Underwood another--and another one. Are you familiar with that? 
WRAY: I'm--yes, I'm familiar with the case. 
JACKSON LEE: Those are not-- 
THOMPSON: --The gentle lady's time has expired. 
JACKSON LEE: Can he--were those protesters? 
WRAY: On the--on the Carrillo case, I don't think we--my route my recollection is there was no evidence that he was participating in the protests himself. I think there was information that he capitalized on the protest as a setting or a medium for which he could commit the tragic attack on the FPS officers that you referred to. 
JACKSON LEE: Yeah, thank you. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Higgins for five minutes. 
HIGGINS: I thank the chairman and the panelists. For the record. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to--I'd like to thank the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Wolf for actively and personally participating in the recovery supervision of my district after Hurricane Laura. Secretary Wolf was on the ground fast and he's been personally at my avail. I regret that we were not able to work out his appearance here today, but I do appreciate his service and the direction he's given and the personal assistance he's given to my office in the wake of Hurricane Laura and the devastation we've suffered there. 
Director Wray, thank you for being here today, good sir, and I'd like to talk to you about election security. The national counterintelligence security center at NCSC released a statement last month outlining China, Russia, and Iran's effort to interfere with upcoming presidential election. You also mentioned in your written testimony that foreign adversaries are attempting to sway U.S. voters' preferences and perspectives, to shift U.S. policies, and to increase discord in the United States and ultimately to undermine American people's confidence in our election process. 
Can you share with us regarding social media platforms, which is--is primarily the means by which this interference effort is being pushed, how is the FBI working with the social media platforms to ensure our election security and to minimize fake profiles and foreign influence in our--in the attitudes and perspectives of our--of the American people? 
WRAY: Well Congressman, thank you for--for the question. You are correct that we are working increasingly closely and have been building over the last few years in our working with the social media sector in particular, but also other kinds of technology companies to thwart the malign foreign influence threat. We--one of the--I guessed the I guess the best way to describe the way that works, and this is really one of the greatest improvements that has occurred in our collective defense against election interference over the last few years, we will take leads that we have information that we have, work very closely with some of that key social media companies. We feed them information and they are able to take action on their platforms using their terms of service, their terms of use to shut down and kick off fake accounts, trolls, bots, et cetera. 
And then in turn, a lot of times what will happen, and this is happening more and more which is great, they're sending back to us new accounts they've identified that then allows us to have more leads to pursue more investigative activity. And so I mentioned one example in my opening statement that recently occurred where we were able to pass information to Facebook and Twitter. They were able to shut down Russian influence accounts really right before they could ever build a following. 
And the faster we can do that and the more agile way we can do that, the better. And the reason for that I think it's important for people to understand, misinformation or disinformation or fake information is only effective if it seems credible, and it's only credible if it's built up some reservoir of credibility, which means that these Russian efforts require a certain amount of time to build up kind of a reservoir of credibility so that when they're really active, people care what they have to say. 
And if we were able to shut them down and knock them back quickly before they can really build up that credibility, then it's not going to stop it, but it means that it's much, much less effective. So we need more of that. We're having more of that. 
HIGGINS: Yes, sir. And thank you for that assessment. That's those were encouraging words. Can we--can we conclude based upon your perspective, Director Wray, that--that the FBI does have an ongoing and functional relationship with the social media platforms to--to deter and--or to dismantle, ultimately, individual efforts by foreign nation states to sway the perspectives of the American people and to ultimately influence our elections? Are you comfortable with--with the kind of--with the kind of relationship and communications you're having with the social media giants? 
WRAY: Well, I guess the best way I could answer that is to say I tend to be ambitious for the organization, for the country, and so I think there's always room for improvement and I'm always impatient for more progress and more improvement. But certainly, the strides that we have made at the FBI working with some of those companies over the last few years has really been very encouraging and I think we're making great progress. I'd like to see more progress, including from them, but we were moving in the right direction for sure. 
THOMPSON: The gentleman's time-- 
HIGGINS: --Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired. I yield. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin for five minutes. 
LANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I wanted to begin by thinking Director Wray and Director Miller for your presence here today and for your testimony. Hearing from our nation's top law enforcement and Homeland Security officials on the--enforcement of Homeland Security officials on the threat facing our country is a of paramount importance to the American people. And I'd also like to--to note my profound disappointment that Mr. Wolf has declined to join you. And I associate myself with the chairman's remarks earlier on that topic. 
Director Wray, let me begin with--with you and let me start on a topic on the Solarium Commission, on which I served as a commissioner, as it did you. I want to thank you for your participation on the commission as well as that of Deputy Director Bowdich, on the commission. I'm very proud of the collaborative work that we did in developing recommendations, many of which I'm optimistic will become law by the end of the year. What are your observations, director, on the final report and which recommendations do you consider most pressing? 
WRAY: Well, first let me say I appreciated the opportunity to serve on the commission and I commend my fellow commissioners, especially you and Senator King and others for--for really pushing this topic before, hopefully, we have some--some truly apocalyptic cyber crisis in this country and for not shying away from some very hard issues. The--I think there are several recommendations in the report that we really would think would benefit our cyber investigative intelligence missions and I think the commission was on the right track on that, including, in particular, really highlighting and encouraging the government to double down on our national cyber investigative joint investigative task force, the NCIJTF that sort of brings a hold of government approach to the importance of attribution, which is so key. 
[*]WRAY: The--you also--I think the commission also highlighted a number of statutory gaps and inconsistencies. There's references to the need to update, for example, the pen and--pen register and trap and trace statutes. There's references to administrative subpoena authority for computer intrusion cases. Those are a few things that jump out at me. 
LANGEVIN: Yeah. 
WRAY: Certainly, the--highlighting the importance-- 
LANGEVIN: --That's--that's good. I'm going to--my time is short so let me jump to another topic. I also want to highlight the joint collaborative environment to allow analysts across government and the private sector to work together to produce their--produce cyber threat intelligence products. So, that's in--another important one. 
But let me turn to elections, please, because this is a very important topic. We only have about seven weeks ago until the election, and early voting begins Monday. And misinformation and disinformation from foreign and domestic actors are widespread. And we've discussed some of this topic already this morning. 
Director Wray, who is responsible for coordinating election security across the interagency? And to put it bluntly, who is--is in charge? And I also want to know who is responsible for coordinating efforts to combat election related misinformation and disinformation. But take them in--in order there. 
WRAY: So, the FBI takes the lead on malign foreign influence domestically, and we work closely with--through our foreign influence task force. We have people from NSA, for example, on our task force. We work very closely, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, with the social media companies, and that's a--really almost daily engagement. And we engage through the foreign influence task force really every day, especially in the current run up to the election, in the interagency on the malign foreign influence piece in particular. 
LANGEVIN: Who would you say is in charge at the interagency? 
WRAY: I'm sorry? 
LANGEVIN: Who would you say is--is responsible for coordinating across the interagency? Who's in charge? 
WRAY: Well, we all work together, just as we do against--against the terrorist threat. It's an interagency process. We take the lead on--on the malign foreign influence threat. DHS takes the lead on the election infrastructure hardening. ODNI takes the lead in terms of coordinating the intelligence analysis that comes out of it. 
LANGEVIN: Good. And--and who's responsible for combating the election related misinformation and disinformation? 
WRAY: I think the FBI takes the lead in combating that. 
LANGEVIN: Well, this is--I appreciate your answer and perspective. I know my time has run out, but I will say this really underscores the need for a national cyber director so that, across response, we have someone that is identified as the person in charge of--working together is important. I highly supported collaborative environment, but also having someone in charge is essential. I know my time's expired. Mr. Chairman, I--I yield back at this point. I'll have other questions for the record. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Arizona, Ms. Lesko. 
LESKO: Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, both of you, and all your employees for the hard work you do protecting our nation. Director Wray, when do you plan to declassify the 302s that were produced regarding the Ukraine election interference in the 2016 election? 
WRAY: I--I don't have an update for you on the timing of any specific declassification document. But--but I'm happy to see if there's information we can provide back to your office as a follow-up. 
LESKO: Thank you. And Director Wray, as you know, IG Horowitz identified numerous major errors in the FISA court application process under the Obama administration's--I would classified it as spying on the Trump campaign. And so, what status are we at in cleaning that whole process up? 
WRAY: So, appreciate the question. Let me say first that I think that report describes conduct that I consider unacceptable and unrepresentative of who I know the FBI to be as an organization. And it cannot be allowed to happen again. 
I've installed an entirely new leadership team. I put in place--on the same day the report came out, implemented over 40 corrective actions that excepted every recommendation in the IG's report and then went up above and beyond. The senior most people involved in that investigation are all gone, either terminated during my tenure or resigned or retired. 
And we're moving forward with changes to processes, training, and oversight within the organization. We're creating a new office of internal audits. You may have seen an announcement from the attorney general on that. We got his approval to--to do that, which will sort of provide the sort of the backend check, the old sort of trust but verify. We'll get the verify part coming through that. So, I'm very encouraged by the progress we're making, but--but, you know, it's going to take hard work. 
LESKO: Well, thank you. And I'm glad that you appreciate it because obviously, to the average American person, including me, if the FBI can spy on an incoming president of the United States, every person in America is concerned that they will spy on them. And so, I'm glad it's being cleaned up. 
I do have a question about Boogaloo. Recently, it's my understanding that to Americans self identifying as members of the Boogaloo Boys were arrested for attempting to partner with Hamas due to their similar goals and missions. Have there been any arrests--have--how have these arrests modified the DHS and FBI approach to investigating and handling rioters and domestic terrorists? 
WRAY: So, I appreciate your--your flagging that particular case. I think it's a--a very revealing, interesting case. It was a Minneapolis case. Those were two individuals who I think associated themselves with the Boogaloos, which, much like Antifa, is more of a movement or an ideology than it is a, a group itself. 
But I think one of the things that a lot of people don't understand about people who subscribe to this sort of Boogaloo thinking is that their main focus is just dismantling, tearing down government, and they're less clear on what it is they think they're going to replace government with. I'm not even sure they would all agree with each other. 
And--and that's why this case in Minneapolis that you highlighted is so revealing, because these two individuals decided that they were on board with providing material support to Hamas, which is not something that most people would previously have associated-- 
LESKO: --Yeah-- 
WRAY: --With-- 
LESKO: --Yeah-- 
WRAY: --With Boogaloos. 
LESKO: It's very interesting. I do have one last question, only 49 seconds left. There have been statements by top people here, in fact Chairman Nadler has said on the floor the U.S. House of Representatives, that basically Antifa is a fantasy made up by the radical right or Fox News or something to that effect. Would you agree with that? Is Antifa a total fantasy, or is it real? 
WRAY: So, Antifa is a real thing. It's not a group or an organization. It's a--it's a movement or an ideology may be one way of thinking of it. And we have quite a number--and I've said this consistently since my first time appearing before this committee. We have any number of properly predicated investigations into what we would describe as violent anarchist extremists, and some of those individuals self identify with--with Antifa. 
LESKO: Thank you, sir. And I yield back. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Richmond, for five minutes. 
RICHMOND: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, let me just express how disappointed I am that DHS is not here although, you know, there are real things that we need to know, especially in Louisiana, from DHS. We have wildfires. We have hurricanes. We need to know if FEMA has the funds to help our American citizens whose lives have been turned upside down, for those people in Lake Charles, Louisiana that are in shelters in surrounding cities like New Orleans. We need to know what's FEMA's plan. Does DHS have the funds? Have the funds been moved over to build a wall? 
Now, look, fortunately for New Orleans, we will escape this time from major damage. However, because of what Congress did for us after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we continue to pay it forward. 
[*]RICHMOND: And even though my colleagues--from Louisiana may not want to criticize DHS or the president, I will we have people who are very vulnerable now and we need to know what is the federal government's plan, the amount of money they have and for DHS not to be here is sad. Let me start Director Wray really quick you talk to about movements in ideologies but Black Lives Matter is more of a principal and an organization and what I'm trying to--what I would like to go into very quickly is that do you all identify as an extremist organization? 
WRAY: I am sorry, can you repeat the question? I am having a little bit of a hard time with the audio. 
RICHMOND: I said black lives matter is a principal and it is also an organization. Do you all identify Black Lives Matter as an extremist organization? 
WRAY: We have not identified Black Lives Matter in--in any way. 
RICHMOND: Do you identify the organization as a violent organization or a threat to peace? 
WRAY: We have--as I said we have not identified the organization in any way. We don't--unlike on the international terrorism side the foreign terrorist side there is no mechanism under U.S. law for us to if we don't identify domestic organizations as anything really? 
RICHMOND: Well, Director Wray I know that you hear all of the time this whole mantra of law and order and what I am trying to do is get you to give some clarification because things may get silly, dangerous, or foolish and so my example would be posting on social media a comment that if (INAUDIBLE) black people come to my city I will drop 10 of them. That is dangerous rhetoric especially when we see people exercising their right to carry arms that are white and that are black and for people to assume that the ones that are black are a threat that they can publicly say I will drop 10 of view is concerning and I know that you as one of our top law and order of the show should have some concern about that rising level of rhetoric and agitation. 
WRAY: Well, we are I think are very concerned about violence of any kind including violence that deprive citizens of their constitutional rights and civil liberties and certainly one of the concerns that we have amidst all of the current unrest is a growing trend of protest begets counter protest begets violence against one side against the other and so there is sort of this increasing phenomenon of individuals attacking each other in addition to attacking law enforcement. That's not good for anybody. 
RICHMOND: Thank you, Director Wray. And really quickly a lot of my mayors have called me from around the country that are saying weight, the violence on the streets, the chaos, and the district and of property people are assigning to Black Lives Matter and from my experience what we are seeing is that is in fact not Black Lives Matter. Would you agree with that statement? 
WRAY: I don't think--I don't think I would characterize it the way you are hearing certainly. I guess what I would say is from one city to another, from one night to another who is committing violence and destruction of property varies widely, sometimes certainly from city to city, sometimes from night to night. I think in general what we are seeing across the country are sort of three groups, right? 
One is three categories is maybe a better way of putting it one is peaceful protesters, lawful peaceful protesters, a second is sort of what I would call criminal opportunist, people engaged in kind of state, local, you know low level vandalism and looting and things like that, that criminal activity needs to be addressed largely a state and local matter and then there's a third category which is the most dangerous and those are the people engaged in our sense of police vehicles, throwing a Molotov cocktails, you know those kinds of things, that is the group that we, FBI, are most focused on, most concernedabout and those groups are motivated by a wide variety of ideologies and agendas. 
RICHMOND: Thank you and I see my time is up. I yield back Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania for five minutes, Mr. Joyce. 
JOYCE: Thank you Mr. Thompson, thank you director Miller and Director Wray for this important update on worldwide threats to our homeland. Director Wray are you seeing a coordinated effort from radical (INAUDIBLE) left wing organizations who are currently perhaps targeting law enforcement officers? 
WRAY: Well, as I said a few minutes ago the violence varies widely. Much of the violence that we are seeing it does not appear to be organized or attributed to any one particular group or even movement. That doesn't make it any less serious or criminal or unacceptable. Now we are seeing in certain pockets more kind of regionally organized folks coalescing, often coordinating on the ground in the middle of protest you know in terms of tactics and things like that and that is some of the most dangerous activity because that is often what leads to destruction of small business, destruction of government buildings and particularly concerning to me you know assaults on law enforcement and federal law enforcement officials in particular but not exclusively. 
We have got case after case of people burning, setting fire and pouring gasoline and--and setting fire to marked police vehicles and so this is not innocuous activity and it takes a very, very, very special person to be willing to put his or her life on the line for a complete strangers every day which is what law enforcement in this country does. And even before all of this latest activity the rate of line of duty deaths was alarming. 
Then you add on top of that COVID and COVID deaths for law enforcement continue because of course law enforcement doesn't have the ability to send it out and now we have seen a significant uptick in violence against law enforcement in this country this year, it is up markedly from last year and the reason I know that besides just looking at the statistics is that I made it a practice after becoming FBI director to every time there is an officer shot and killed in this country to personally call the chief or sheriff responsible for that officer and express my condolences and support on behalf of the FBI and I will tell you we had a stretch just recently late August, early September I think it was maybe more recently than that where over a 15 day stretch I made seven of those phone calls. That is an officer feloniously killed every other day and these are people you know average age is in their late 30s, they had their whole lives ahead of them, they had families and it breaks my heart. 
JOYCE: I applaud you for connecting with local law enforcement when these tragedies occur. You and I realize that these men and women bravely every day put on the uniform to protect us. Continuing along this line has there been any assistance from social media companies to help weed out potential threats when these organizations are using their platforms? 
WRAY: Well, somewhat like I was describing in response to a question earlier on the election influence context or threat we do have relationships with the social media companies in which again in a similar way they will sometimes detect activity on their platforms and working jointly with us they will sometimes use their terms of use or terms of service to shut down or kick off those accounts and flag information for law enforcement. So any assistance I would say yes, some assistance it varies you know a bit from company to company, some of them devote more resources to that kind of operation which supports law enforcement than others but we do certainly have a number of--of engagements with four partnerships almost with some of those companies. 
JOYCE: And finally, do you see any foreign government attempting to communicate with these organizations or assist any political party within them? 
WRAY: I'm sorry which--which organizations are we talking about now? 
JOYCE: With these left wing organizations which I think are behind so much of the attacks on law enforcement. 
WRAY: I guess I would answer that in two parts. One, we have seen some efforts by our foreign adversaries I would mention China and Russia is typically but not exclusively to sort of piggyback on a lot of the unrest activity that has been occurring as part of the effort either to so divisiveness and discord in the case of the Russians or to try to advance their own narratives--uh--say in the case of the Chinese. So there's that level of kind of engagement and then I would say the second piece is maybe not the organizations you're talking about, but we have seen some engagement between racially motivated violent extremists and like-minded individuals overseas on that front. 
JOYCE: Thank you for your insights and thank you for your update. 
THOMPSON: The chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Payne for five minutes. 
PAYNE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's an honor and a privilege to be here today with the committee. And let me first say to Mr. Wray and Mr. Miller that I appreciate you understanding your obligations to show up when the committee requests your appearance as opposed to the empty chair that is there. 
Let me ask Mr. Wray, is there a--so with Antifa, you're saying it's more of an ideology than--than an organized group, you know, which, you know a lot of people, you know, on the other side feel is some organized group. Is it an organized group or is it more of just a notion, a thought, a philosophy with respect to this because, you know, when I hear this, you know, Antifa is there, Antifa is doing this, I'm still trying to figure out who and what Antifa is. Could you enlighten me? 
WRAY: Well, first let me say as I think I said in response to an earlier question, Antifa is a real thing. It's not a fiction, but it is--it's not an organization or a structure. We view it more as a--we understand it to be more of a kind of a movement or maybe you could call it an ideology. And we certainly have, as I've said, a number of, and we have had for some time and we've opened quite a number of this year of properly predicated investigations into violent anarchist extremists who subscribe to self-identify with Antifa. They say, you know, ""I am Antifa,"" you know, things like that. 
And we have seen individuals--I think I've mentioned this in response to one of the earlier questions identified with the Antifa movement coalescing regionally into what you might describe as small groups or nodes. And we are actively investigating the potential violence from those regional nodes, if you will. 
THOMPSON: Thank you, congressman. You might need to unmute yourself. 
UNKNOWN: We're having audio issues with Webex. 
THOMPSON: We've been advised that we have we're having some issues with Webex right now. We're trying to correct that. We'll stand by. 
PAYNE: Okay. 
UNKNOWN: Okay. 
THOMPSON: The gentleman from New Jersey may continue. 
PAYNE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is there--did--Mr. Wray, did you finish your--your response? 
WRAY: I finished my response, but I'm not sure whether you were still online while I finished. I'd be happy to--I'd be happy to pick up where I left if you tell me where you lost contact. 
PAYNE: Yes. Well--well I think I think I got the gist of your response. So I'll move on. Mr.--Mr. Miller, the past four years have seen the United States significantly scale back its presence and commitments around the world. Our NATO allies no longer trust us to keep our commitments, leaving the door open for other forces to step into this vacuum. 
And as we've seen, time--as we've seen time and again, instability leads to violence. Is the National Counterterrorism Center planning for the effects of a global vacuum--a global leadership vacuum? 
MILLER: Thank you, sir, for that question. I've been so impressed. I've been doing this for a few years and the most amazing thing is the partnerships we have internationally on the counter terrorism front and I have seen no degradation in our commitment and partnerships in that regard. As a matter of fact, often times it's--it's almost one of those--during the Cold War we said foreign policy ended at the water's edge. It's very much the same way with counterterrorism now. 
Obviously concerned about drawing back from our commitments overseas, but we maintain a robust, very significant counterterrorism presence overseas. And we have the ability to generate combat power and deploy that forward if there's an enemy terrorist group that is in a position to threaten us. 
PAYNE: Do you--do you believe that the United States is acting as a global leader should? 
MILLER: As you noted, we are in a great transformation geopolitically and geostrategically from the counter terrorism aspect. I talked with all my partners regularly without Five Eyes and I go very confident that we maintain a close relationship and partnership and leadership role. 
THOMPSON: The gentleman from New Jersey's time has expired. The chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Bishop. 
BISHOP: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Have a doggie in the background, it sounds like. First, I'd note that the petty game about who from the Department of Homeland Security testifies today must be amazing to Americans outside the Beltway. This is the annual hearing on worldwide threats to the Homeland and I can't, for one, imagine setting aside that priority in order to engage in a snit with the Department about whether it Mr. Wolf or Mr. Cuccinelli appears. We have neither. 
And in light of that, I'll direct questions, Director Wray, to you. All summer and early fall, of course, we've seen numerous and ongoing riots, looting, property destruction, even serious injuries and killings in cities across the United States, Minneapolis, LA, Seattle, Charleston, Chicago, Saint Louis, Washington DC, Rochester, Lancaster, and of course, Portland come to mind. Now, we've seen some media characterized these events as fiery but mostly peaceful and politicians have dismissed them, occasionally, as myth. But Americans have seen independent reports and shocking videos and they keep coming. 
I don't really understand the thinking of lawmakers who seek perversely to justify this criminality by pointing to the existence of other violent extremists with different ideology. I would think all elected officials would condemn violence, regardless of the ideology of the perpetrator and dispatch perhaps especially for ideologies closer to their position on the spectrum. But indeed, as Ms. Lesko pointed out earlier, the characterization of right and left in these things is pretty hard to condemn. 
In any event, some of these reports even early on have suggested that there were pallets of brick pre-positioned in riot areas. We've seen reports of vehicles on singing to facilitate or supply rioters, coordination of activity via social media you made reference to earlier, and Interstate travel of rioters to multiple venues. All of these, in turn, suggest a funding source or multiple funding sources. You have made reference as has the attorney general to numerous arrests having been made. 
[*]BISHOP: Are you investigating if we had sources of funding in support of the criminal activity? 
WRAY: I appreciate the question. And certainly, we have a number of investigations and are pursuing a number of leads that do things like try to identify networks, travelers, supply sources. We look at repeat offenders. 
As I mentioned, I think in response to the question from one of your colleagues, one of the things that's been so challenging about this is that an awful lot of the--the coordination or be--whether it's coordination or organization, if you will, that occurs is happening kind of on the ground, you know, in the dark on the streets at a tactical level as opposed to kind of a more structured or coordinated national level. And that makes it that much harder to investigate and disrupt. 
But I--I think it's important for--for people to understand that, although I do agree that the majority of the people out there protesting in general across the country are peaceful protesters, there's no question that the--a big number--the biggest number is peaceful protesters, that should not diminish, which I think is the point you're making, from the fact that even though it might numerically be a smaller group, that's very dangerous activity that that smaller group is engaged in. 
And--and that's why the FBI is focused--much as your question was, we're focused on the violence-- 
BISHOP: --To--to be-- 
WRAY: --Not the ideology. 
BISHOP: To be sure. 
WRAY: We don't really care left, right, violence is wrong. We're going after the violence. We don't care what motivates it. 
BISHOP: To be sure. Those issues ought to be irrelevant to this committee or to any law enforcement agency in the United States, that is to say what ideology someone has or their First Amendment activity. And to say--so that much of that happening is, frankly, something that we should take no cognizance of. 
But as to those people who are engaging in--in violence and destruction, and there have been many, the question becomes, with its proliferation so many places, is the FBI examining the finances underlying the people who you are rest to see what their Venmo accounts say, to see what the sources of--of cash or that come to them that their buying the supplies with and their fireworks that they fire enforcement off--officers? And are you using civil forfeiture laws to--to disrupt those sources of--of funding and the like? 
WRAY: Well, without referencing any specific investigation, I can tell you that there are any number of investigations in which the--the source of funding, the source of supply are things that--that are of particular interest and--and the things that we're actively questioning and pursuing leads on. 
As far as a civil forfeiture piece, I will confess that sitting here right now in the hearing, I can't off the top of my head think of a situation where we've yet been able to use that. But we will use every tool in our toolbox if we think it fits. 
BISHOP: My time is expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from New York for five minutes, Ms. Rice. 
RICE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Miller, late last month your boss, the director of National Intelligence, Ratcliffe, said the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would cease in person election security briefings to Congress. Then just yesterday, he reversed that decision and said that he will continue to brief the Senate and House Intel Committees on efforts to secure the 2020 elections from foreign interference, but will no longer conduct briefings for all lawmakers, citing the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. 
It's incredibly frustrating that a nonpartisan issue like the security of our elections has been so politicized that members of Congress are now considered untrustworthy with this critical information. It's also particularly alarming this information is being withheld from members of Congress only weeks after DHS confirmed publicly that Russia was working to boost President Trump again by discrediting Vice President Biden's health. 
You commit to us that the DNI will continue to keep all members of Congress informed on election security threats? And if your answer is yes, how do you plan on doing that? 
MILLER: Ma'am, without respect, I don't do election security. I absolutely will provide any information you require, the Congress requires on terrorism matters. But that--that really is a decision that's been--being made at the DNI level. And I--I--my--my center, we just do counterterrorism, ma'am. 
RICE: Well, maybe you can take the message back to your boss, because-- 
MILLER: --Yes, ma'am-- 
RICE: --To say that members of Congress are not worthy to be trusted with this information when it's actually our job to have this information and to have some level of oversight is really disturbing. 
MILLER: Yes, ma'am, I'd be happy to take that message back. 
RICE: Thank you. Mr. Wray, recently the Department of Justice and federal partners conducted the largest ever seizure of terrorist organizations' cryptocurrency accounts, seizing in total 300 accounts allegedly used by foreign terrorist organizations like al Qaeda, ISIS, and Hamas to fund attacks. 
These--this--out of this committee, we passed a bipartisan bill that would require DHS to develop and submit a threat assessment report on the use of virtual currencies by terrorist organizations. This--this version of the bill was included in the NDAA and signed into law just this past December. 
This case demonstrates the adaptability of terrorist groups who have traditionally used unlicensed money services businesses or other money-laundering operations to adopt their terror finance activities to the cyber age. In your opinion, will crypto currencies continue to be used by these terrorist organizations on a wider basis? What trends are you and your respective department seeing in this matter? 
WRAY: Well, congresswoman, I--I agree with you that crypto currency is a--is a source of particular concern. It's proliferating not just across terrorist threats, but across other kinds of criminal threats as well and, within the terrorism space, both across international terrorists and domestic. 
And it makes it one of the key investigative tools that we have, where the key investigative strategies that we have in that space, much as was in the answer that I just gave to--to Congressman Bishop, is to follow the money. That's one of our go-to moves. And, of course, the ability to follow the money is critical across every threat. And the cryptocurrency makes it that much harder for us to do that. 
We have developed a lot of expertise on that, but each time we sort of solve one kind of crypto currency, a new kind comes on the market. And part of the reason why this is such a big deal is that it--it fits with other technological trends which--which have the--a similar kind of effect of hiding and obstructing criminal activity from law enforcement. 
So, if you think about any investigation we have, you've got the stuff, the documents, the communications, you got the people, the witnesses, the sources, human sources, and you got the money. Well, if cryptocurrency hides the money, if default end to end encryption blocks us from any kind of lawful access to the stuff, and if artificial intelligence and all of the various ways in which technology makes it easier to--to find human sources--makes it harder for us to protect human sources, then we lose the money, people, and the stuff. And that's when we're in a really bad space as a country from--from protecting us from terrorist threats all the way to organized criminal threats and others. 
RICE: Can I ask you to just talk a little bit more--you made reference earlier in response to a question about the collaboration that your agency has with social media platforms in terms of misinformation and disinformation. Can you just talk more about that? Because if people can't trust the information that they're getting, I mean, that just goes to the heart of, you know, really affecting, you know, what I think all of us on this committee want to do, which is everyone's right and ability to vote and base their decisions on facts, not misinformation and disinformation. 
WRAY: So, this is one of our key challenges, both for the FBI and for the interagency and for the country. Misinformation, disinformation is not new, but what is new is the ability through social media to amplify it at scale in a much more challenging way. 
That's why the partnerships with the private sector and was Silicon Valley, the tech companies, etc., has become so critical to our efforts. There are things that they can do and they have resources to take responsibility for things that are happening on their own platforms much more quickly and--and within greater legal flexibility under their terms of use and terms of service than we could do through law enforcement needs. And so, that's why that is--that's part of the key effort. 
Now we, the FBI, are not and can't be the truth police. And a lot of people don't understand that that is not how we go about deterring misinformation efforts and malign foreign influence efforts. We follow the threat. So, if it's the Russians, we follow the Russian actors. 
[*]WRAY: (INAUDIBLE) Identify certain accounts, we talk to the social media companies, they take action but we don't have people sitting on social media trying to find things that look false and then wondering who did it. We go the other way to look at the actor and then see what they are trying to spread. The social media companies so they can come at it in whatever way they want based on their terms of service and they have resources that I envy sometimes that they can and should and are increasingly bringing to the fight. 
It is particularly of concern to us in the election context when Americans make the mistake of getting information about elections themselves from social media so it is one thing to push out Ms. information about a candidate or a policy or something else but when information gets pushed out about where you go to vote, whether your polling places open, whether it's closed that kind of thing we are trying to make sure Americans know to get information about where and when and how you vote you need to go to your local election officials website and don't take it from social media. 
RICE: Thank you both for being here today. Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Crenshaw for five minutes. 
CRENSHAW: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you for moving us into a much cooler room. 
THOMPSON: Much cooler. 
CRENSHAW: Thank you Director Wray for being here. I would like to ask you about a number of things. China, Iran, Russia. They thing is I think politically there's not that much daylight between us on these issues, we largely agree on these--on these threats but there seems to be disagreement over politically speaking is the source of the domestic threats that we are facing that the vast amount of looting, rioting and instruction that has occurred in our country over the last few months. 
I don't understand why we disagree on these origins but we do. There has been a lot of peaceful process, that is absolutely true. There's also been more than 550 declared riots, many stoked by extremist and Antifa and the BLM organization. A recent report indicated between $1 billion and $2 billion of insurance claims will be paid out. That doesn't even come close to measuring the actual and true damage done to people's lives, not even close. That's just insurance. We've heard multiple reports of small businesses without any insurance whatsoever. Some of these will never open up even if they did get insurance payments. 
I have heard many members of this body, of this committee question whether Antifa even exist. Director Wray, earlier you confirmed Antifa does indeed exist that you consider it more of an ideology than a group, correct? 
WRAY: Yes, and ideology or maybe a movement. 
CRENSHAW: Okay. That seems to me to be downplaying it and this is an ideology that organizes locally, it coordinates regionally and nationally where is a standardized uniform it collects funds to buy high powered lasers to blind federal officers, built homemade explosive devices, feed the rioters since they clearly aren't working and then bail out those who have been arrested. This is an ideology that has trained its members, makes shield wall (INAUDIBLE) to attack federal officers. It formed an autonomous zone in an American city and besieged a federal courthouse in another so I mean it just seems to be more than an ideology. Do you have a way to--to define what you mean by it's not a group? 
WRAY: So I want to be clear that by describing it as an ideology or movement I by no means mean to minimize the seriousness of the violence and criminality that is going on across the country some of which is attributable to that people inspired by or who self-identify with that ideology and movement. We are focused on that violence, on that criminality and some of it is extremely serious. 
CRENSHAW: And you mentioned before three categories the criminality, the peaceful protesting but then and you didn't use these words but I will ideological rioting. I think that sort of matches that third category of what you said the people who purposefully want to instigate it, Antifa being clearly one of them so I want to read you the definition of domestic terrorism section 2331, it says domestic terrorism has three components A, involves acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state; B, appearing to be intended first to intimidate or coerce a civilian population two, to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or three, to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping and see, occurred primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Does that at all match the activities of Antifa? 
WRAY: Well, it certainly matches the activity of some of the individuals we are investigating and have pursued other kinds of charges against. You put your finger on a little bit of the legal predicament which is that there is not currently in title 18 a domestic terrorism offense or crime as such. There's a definition - make 
CRENSHAW: That seems pretty specific. 
WRAY: Well, there is a definition but ironically there's not unlike on the international foreign terrorist side there's not a crime of domestic terrorism that you can charge so typically we in domestic terrorism cases including of these sort you are describing we are pursuing explosive charges, firearms charges, rioting charges you mentioned or other-- 
CRENSHAW: Are you prevented from say following the Monte and following the websites that these groups are clearly organizing again it seems strange to me that we can't call led a group. 
WRAY: We are not--we are not precluded from following the money as I have said to Congressman Bishop we have a number-- 
CRENSHAW: That's good. 
WRAY: --of investigations where we-- 
CRENSHAW: One more--one more question before my time runs out. 
WRAY: It is not a material support to offense like there is you know we do material support to al Qaeda or ISIS, there is not a material support to a domestic terrorism. 
CRENSHAW: One more question. The FBI's civil rights investigation can target law enforcement officials who willfully failed to keep the public from harm in violation of the color of law statute. Does that apply to mayors and city councils who have restrained their Police Department such as Mayor Wheeler in Portland, Mayor De Blasio in New York, and the Minneapolis city Council? 
WRAY: Well, respectfully I think that is a legal question that I would want to defer to the attorney general and department of justice on whether that would apply there. 
CRENSHAW: Thank you. I yield my time. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Correa. 
CORREA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our witness is to day Director Wray, director Miller for being here today I want to thank all of the good folks who work under you and your agencies for keeping us in this country safe and keeping our families safe as well and I will thank you Mr. Chairman Thompson also for holding this most important hearing and your focus today is a central topic of this homeland security which is keeping this country secure. One of the purposes of this committee is to assess international as well as domestic threats to this country. 
One of those threats right now I guess one I hear about much in my district is election security but not only our foreign actors threatening to again interfere with our election but there's a lot of concern in my district about transition peaceful transition of power in this country, that has been the hallmark of our democracy and a lot of my constituents are concerned that if President Trump loses in November he will not relinquish power and he will try to stay in office. I am reminded of Al Gore who lost the election in the year 2000 and by a ruling of 5-4 in the United States Supreme Court. 
I am saddened that Mr. Wolf is not here today because I wanted to ask him a few questions yes or no and I really what I really wanted from Mr. Wolf was I wanted to ask him to make the same commitment as general Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has made and I'm going to quote him, open quote and General Milley said I believe deeply in the principle of in a political U.S. military in the event of a dispute over some aspect of the elections, by law U.S. courts and the U.S. Congress are required to resolve any disputes not the military and I foresee no role for the U.S. Armed Forces in this process. And I was hoping that Mr. Wolf would also take that pledge and Mr. Chairman since he's not here I would like to submit for the record that these questions in writing and hopefully you can get them to him and he will respond to them. 
THOMPSON: Without objection. 
CORREA: And gentlemen, I have a question for both of you. Some time in mid-August, the Senate Intelligence Committee released its fifth and final version or volume I should say regarding the Russian interference into the 2016 election. That Senate report found that Manafort passed sensitive campaign information to Russian intelligence officers in my question to both of you is are you monitoring to make sure that it's not only foreign interference into our elections but rather that campaigns here in the U.S. are not trying to ask or solicit foreign support by foreign countries of domestic campaigns? Question. 
WRAY: Well, certainly, we pursue what I would call foreign influence investigations both with respect to election interference in the sense that-- 
[*]WRAY: --it was just described in the Senate--in the SSCI report, but also in terms of, you know, political corruption or illegal campaign financing cases and things like that. Some of those are criminal investigations, some of those are even counterintelligence investigations in certain scenarios, I can imagine. So we certainly have a number of people working on those kinds of matters and that's a threat that we take very seriously. As part of our overall effort to protect not just our elections but our democracy from foreign interference and influence. 
CORREA: Mr. Miller. 
MILLER: Sir, in accordance with statute, that's beyond the remit of that National Counterterrorism Center. We--we focus on linkages of international terrorist organizations into domestically, but I have no role in that and I'm not completely familiar with all the ends and outs, sir. 
CORREA: I'm running out of time, so very quickly, Mr. Miller, then under your definition of terrorism, how does the concept of foreign interference of our elections, foreign manipulation of our democracy fit into the concept of terrorism? 
MILLER: Sir, we focus on acts of violence committed against American citizens for--to effect political change from an international context only. The--when you talk about influence and what not, that's a different category that doesn't fall within--within our remit, sir. 
CORREA: Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time. I yield. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey for five minutes, Mr. Van Drew. 
VAN DREW: Thank you, chairman. Thank you all for being here today. Just very briefly, I wanted to go back to the Antifa issue. So we if we have an organization that is able to communicate among different counties, different states, different areas, different cities, is able to organize when Black Lives Matter also organizes at the same time, advertises for people to help them and they will pay them, feeds them, as we said so eloquently before, and takes care of them, that to me would be more than just the loosely knit group of people. 
I mean, I guess we want to define this a little bit that there--in my mind, there is Antifa, there's a group or individuals that control antifa and had some authority over it and it is some--to some degree without question organized. Would you agree with that? 
WRAY: Well, I think what I would say is that we have seen folks who subscribe to or self-identify with the Antifa movement who couple us regionally into what we refer to or think of as more small groups or it nodes and there certainly organized at that level, those individuals-- 
VAN DREW: --Not to interrupt you-- 
WRAY: --Yeah-- 
VAN DREW: --And--but for example, and I understand that some people self-identify as communists, yet there is a real communist organization that is organized at the same time. 
WRAY: Right. I think--I'm not sure I'm seeing the rest of your question. 
VAN DREW: So what time--what I'm saying to you, maybe take clarify a little bit more, is just because some people self-identify doesn't mean that there is more of an organizational aspect to this and that there's something out there that deserves a very thorough investigation. 
WRAY: Well on the last part, I would say that we are very thoroughly investigating. And as I mentioned, we have a number of--quite a number of properly predicated investigations being conducted by our joint terrorism task forces around the country into violent anarchist extremism and any number of those involve people who are tied either by their own admission or otherwise to the antifa movement. 
And in some cases, in some cases we see in those individuals working together in a in a tactical, organized way. And so the investigation in those instances might be more of a what we might call an enterprise investigation. 
VAN DREW: Let--let me ask you this question. Black Lives Matters, which are good words, black lives do matter. Black babies, like parents, mothers and grand (INAUDIBLE) human beings and human souls. So there's nothing wrong with those words. Yet, it is emblematic of an organization that is Marxist. Just get your Google out and look it up. 
It's a Marxist organization and it is also an organization that believes in some degree in overthrow and a change of the country and it also believes that the nuclear family, the traditional family that we know has a place no more. Is there any examples or is there any real interaction with Antifa and Black Lives Matter or did they just happen to always be at the same place at the same time? 
WRAY: I'm not sure there's anything I could share on that, certainly in this--in this kind of setting. I guess what I would say to you, and again, it's important to understand this four--not for you, but for people listening, write, we investigate the violence. We are about the violence. We are agnostic about the idea ideology. We don't investigate the ideology. 
But when the ideology inspires violence, we will investigate the violence aggressively. And when I make comments about movements and ideologies, I want to be very clear that I'm in no way minimizing the seriousness of the criminal conduct and the violence that we're investigating or in any way downplaying the aggressiveness or determination of the FBI to investigate those leads fully and pursue whatever charges are available to us. 
VAN DREW: Because the ideology of Antifa is based on changing and breaking down the United States of America, so I--I think that's something that we have to all just admit, you know, kind of--not you all. I'm not saying that to you, but in a cruder way, strap them on and say yeah, this is what it is and this is something we have to deal with. 
One other quick question here too, we are seeing a lot of emerging threats as a result of the evolving communication technology. I just want to ask you a few questions. What role have novel communication technologies played in the recent rise in domestic extremism? 
WRAY: So-- 
VAN DREW: --And are you getting the tools you need to really deal with this? 
WRAY: Right. I very much appreciate the question and I actually think it flows naturally out of the first topic that you raised because the coordination, the communication that we're describing and some of the frustrations that we have in really drilling into that is in part due to terrorist actors, whether domestic or international for that matter, relying on increasingly end to end encrypted messaging platforms. And we're getting to a point where the technology companies are creating an entire world warrant proof world in which there are devices and communications platforms, that it doesn't matter how awful the conduct, it doesn't matter how tragic the victim, it doesn't matter how bulletproof legally our court order image to get into it, we're going to be winded to it. 
And that's a dangerous, dangerous world for us to be in and it's directly relevant to some of the activity that you're describing, but lots of other threats to. I'll take, for example, the Sutherland Springs shootings. Some of the members of the committee, and you may remember, which was one of the deadliest shootings in America down in Texas. You know, the phone that that shooter had, we've been trying for now three years to get into it. 
And this is not just an FBI problem, it's not just a federal law enforcement problem. If you talk to state and local law enforcement leaders around the country like I do every day, you hear about this issue more and more all the time. And so we have to figure out a way to deal with that or we're going to create a world where law enforcement is blind in its ability to protect kids, families, and communities. 
VAN DREW: And one-- 
THOMPSON: --The gentleman--the gentleman's time has expired. 
VAN DREW: I'm sorry. Thank you very much for your time. 
THOMPSON: The Chair recognizes the gentle lady from New Mexico, Ms. Torres Small. 
TORRES SMALL: Thank you, Director Wray and Director Miller for being here. Transnational criminal organizations present a continuing threat to our Homeland and our border communities. I've discussed efforts to curtail their efforts with Acting Secretary Wolf and was hoping to continue that work today. However, I look forward to working with the department in the future to strengthen our border security. 
As I've said many times, to fully understand the threats and our defense capabilities at the Southwest border, the department needs a mile by mile analysis of that border, which is why I recently introduced legislation directing the department to conduct such an analysis and to develop a plan to meet gaps identified in that analysis. I understand CBP conducts--conducts a border security improvement plan coming which is a start, albeit limited and I request the department provide it to the committee as soon as possible. 
Moving on to cyber security, Director Wray, according to U.S. intelligence officials, Chinese and Russian hackers are using cyber tools to steal American biomedical research used for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Officials have also expressed concern about the possibility of Chinese and Russian hackers damaging American efforts to develop a vaccine. What is the department doing to combat foreign hackers and to work with pharmaceutical and academic--academic institutions to strengthen their cyber defense capabilities? 
[*]WRAY: So, congresswoman, you're--you're correct that we are saying efforts by our--our foreign adversaries to engage in cyber targeting of COVID vaccine research, testing technology, treatment technology, and efforts to disrupt our national response to the pandemic. We've recently publicly attributed some of that conduct to China's most prolific cyber actors. I know that our UK counterparts have publicly attributed some activity there on the same kind of fun to Russian actors as well. 
We're--we've tried to be very forward leaning in our engagement and outreach to companies, manufacturers, universities, research centers, etc., when we see targeting by these adversaries, cyber targeting, so that they can take appropriate steps from a cybersecurity perspective to harden their systems and--and prevent exfiltration of the information. 
And so far, I think we've been pretty successful in getting there before valuable information has been lost. But it's a--make no mistake, this is a very, very real cyber threat that we're contending with daily. 
TORRES SMALL: Thank you, Director Wray. Congressman Higgins and you also discussed Russian disinformation related to the elections. Another way that Russia is--in particular is seeking to undermine Americans recovery is with COVID-19 and the public health crisis are spreading that same disinformation on the virus and on future vaccines to create distrust within the public. Are there any distinct challenges in disrupting Russia's disinformation specifically on--on COVID-19 and vaccination efforts? 
WRAY: Well--well, certainly misinformation--we share your concerns about misinformation about--about COVID, whether it's misinformation about the infectiousness of the disease itself or misinformation about treatments and cures, vaccines. And in some instances, we are able to, and we have, pursued cases for various scams and schemes, you know, essentially fraud, people pitching fraudulent tests and cures and people claiming to have the vaccine, you know, things like that. So, we've--when there's sort of fraud engaged, we're able to use law enforcement tools to go after it. 
But as I said in the election context, and you're right to kind of draw the analogy, we're not the truth police. And especially on something like medical issues, we defer to CDC and the medical professionals to correct misinformation there. But it's--it's important that people get their information in this context from the medical professionals and not from things like social media. 
TORRES SMALL: Just reclaiming my time briefly, just to stay on Russia and making sure that Russia is not spreading disinformation on this, you mentioned that a key strategy of working to disrupt Russian voices of disinformation was--was stopping them up before they gained credibility. And a--and so, I wanted to see if, in the COVID-19 space, there's an extra challenge there, if, for example, Russian disinformation is gaining credibility, for example, through anti-vaxxers. 
WRAY: Well, certainly as we've--as we discussed and as you mentioned, the essence of disinformation--the only way it works is to do it through voices that are viewed as credible. So, if there were--I'm not sure that I can think of a specific example off the top of my head, but if there were a situation where a credible voice that people really paid attention to as a medical expert was--was pushing out, under the guise of being a medical expert, flawed--badly flawed and dangerous information, then that would be a source of particular concern. 
TORRES SMALL: Thank you. My time is expired. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Guest, for five minutes. 
GUEST: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Wray, want to direct these questions to you. We're here today talking about threats to the homeland, and--and I specifically want to discuss recent attacks on our law enforcement officials. 
We saw just this past weekend in California--the headlines from Fox read ""Compton Ambush Leaves Two Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies Fighting for Their Lives."" The story goes on to say a man in underway in California early Sunday after two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were shot in their patrol car by a suspect who opened fire without warning or provocation. 
The deputies, a 24-year-old man and 31-year-old woman, were both in critical condition at the time of this article and fighting for their lives as they underwent surgery following the attack. A handful of anti-police protesters show up at the hospital where the deputies were being treated. A local faith leader who came to the hospital to pray for the deputies told a reporter that some of the protesters had been shouting slogans like death to the police. Protesters were blocking the entrance to the hospital emergency room and yelling we hope they die. 
In June 2020, the AP reported ""California Deputies Shot in Ambush Attack at the Police Station."" A California deputy was shot in the head but survived in ambush by a gunman intent on harming or killing the police. The shooter opened fire around 3:40 A.M. on the backside of the police station. 
ABC News, July 22nd of this year, ""Police Officers Killed Surged 28 Percent This Year, and Some Point to Civil Unrest and Those Looking to Exploit It."" CNN, February 10th, 2020, ""Attacks on Police Are a Cause for Alarm."" The article goes to say--on to say an armed assailant approached a marked police van in the Bronx on Saturday evening and opens fire on two on-duty police officers. The suspect, who remained a large until the firing--following morning, then on Sunday police video captures a man, later identified as the same suspect, strolling into NYPD's 41st precinct before opening fire on police, wounding a lieutenant. 
Fox News, June of this year, ""Police under Siege."" They go through incident after incident of attack on police; Buffalo, New York, two law enforcement officers are struck by a vehicle Monday, and another was run over during a demonstration in front of the Buffalo Police Department's E District. The trooper who was run over suffered a shattered pelvis and broken leg. 
Cincinnati, Ohio, an officer was saved by a ballistic helment when a bullet struck the protective covering. Chicago, police reports Monday that 132 of its officers had been injured during violent riots. Davenport, Iowa, an undercover police officer in an unmarked vehicle was struck twice by gunfire. Las Vegas, a Las Vegas police officer was on life support after being shot in the head Monday during a protest. Minnesota, shots were fired at law enforcement officers near a Minnesota police station last week. On May 28th, another, which means a second, police precinct in the city was set ablaze as violent protests surged. 
New York, a New York police officer was seen being struck by a vehicle in what appeared to be a deliberate hit and run. Oakland, California, several shots were fired at Oakland police headquarters. A federal law enforcement officer was also shot and killed Friday night. 
We see story after story after story of violence against our first responders. The very men and women who put their safety in jeopardy to protect us are under attack. And so, director, I ask you at this time, what intelligence, what information can you share about us about--about these attacks? And also, what can we do ask Congress to better protect our first responders? 
WRAY: Well, first let me say, although I'm familiar with every one of those instances you described, just hearing you go through them again is just yet another reminder to me about how tragic this is. And I think it's important for Americans to take a deep breath for a second and think about what it means for somebody to put his or her life on the line for a complete stranger and then, after they've paused and thought about that for a second, to think about what it means to get up every morning and do that day after day after day after day. 
As I said in response to I think one of the earlier questions and you've touched on through your comments, the number of officers feloniously killed in the line of duty this year is up significantly from last year. And that's not even counting all the officers who were lost to COVID because they have to be out on the streets doing their jobs and they can't stay home. That's not counting all the officers who miraculously survived an attack but whose lives are forever altered. That's not counting the officers who died in things like vehicle incidents as their racing to the crime scene. 
[*]WRAY: Every time an officer is shot and killed or killed through adversarial action in this country I was going to call myself the chief or the sheriff and express my condolences on behalf of the FBI and each time I do it I asked my staff to give me a picture, a photograph of the officer and a description of you know their families so I know how many kids they have, all of their kids were I had a guy recently who was engaged to be married six months out of his wedding day who was killed and I will never forget for example having to call in your home state to Brookhaven, Mississippi where they lost two officers in a single incident in the department of you know I want to say less than 30 people. 
We think about what that means to a department like that where every single person knew those two officers. So I understand people in this country are angry and upset and hurt and I get that and there's reasons to be angry and upset and no means mean to--to minimize their concern and hurt but the law enforcement family is hurt to and these people who put on the uniform and go out to protect all of us and our families every day deserve some level of appreciation and I appreciate your comments. 
GUEST: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. Director Wray for the record I think there is no issue around support for law enforcement on this committee it has consistently been there, it is only when the rules get changed is the concern and I might ask Mr. Rose to talk a little bit about the rules. After 9/11 Congress did quite a bit (INAUDIBLE) toward supporting the men and women and their families who have lost their lives and all of these sudden in the middle of this New York gets penalized in terms of the resources that Congress had already approved so it is those kind of things. With that I yield to the gentleman from New York. 
ROSE: Chairman, thank you. Director Wray, director Miller first of all we have--we do not have a domestic terrorist destination in the United States of America, we have a foreign terrorist organization destination especially designated terrorist group designation. That is correct? Okay. Aside from a domestic terrorist designation which is in our legislative purview, something I support, something that some Republicans do not support, some Democrats do not support. Do you need any other further resources to go after criminal organizations in the United States of America that are organizing to inflict violence on American citizens, law enforcement especially? 
WRAY: Well, I think I would put resources in sort of two categories. One is funding, right, for data analytics which I can explain why that is relevant to boots on the ground you know, etc. So there is that piece of it and then I would say there are tools, we always want more tools and I touched on one of the concerns earlier which is this in and to end encryption issue and when especially when you talk about organizations and people communicating with each other if we move into a world in which bad guys have a choice between putting all of their information in their communications in platforms or devices that are utterly that are warrant proof that are utterly beyond reach of law no matter how rock solid the legal case is I don't think that's a judgment that those companies should be making on behalf of the American people. I think that is something that say Congress-- 
ROSE: I'm most certainly agree. Can you please commit to getting us in a memo form or a list form the tools you think you need to keep us safe and our law enforcement officials safe and our said this and save from violent criminal organizations in the United States of America? 
WRAY: We would be happy to follow up with you with-- 
ROSE: Thank you. So then let's see that we can unite around something here rather than what it appears that we are doing. 
I want to move on to the threat of white supremacist globally, domestically. Director Miller, looking at the existing list of SDTGs and FTOs put that list aside which organizations are you concerned with particularly in the white supremacist organization front? 
MILLER: As you noted thank you, it's nice to have an Army veteran here by the way yeah, Russian Imperial movement as you know we designate-- 
ROSE: Absolutely. 
MILLER: Which was I thought a real strong statement in a good way. We see the other groups you see what is going on in Germany right now-- 
ROSE: Which groups? 
MILLER: Well, you know they change their name so fast these days to keep ahead of us-- 
ROSE: So things like (INAUDIBLE), combat 18(SP)-- 
MILLER: Sure. 
ROSE: (INAUDIBLE) now if you look at any of those global groups do you see any connection between those groups in Germany, central Europe or otherwise? Any connections between those groups and domestic organizations? 
MILLER: Nothing monolithic or--we are not picking up anything of a routine systemic connection. I think what you will see is more ad hoc because they are all sitting online together chatting but have not picked up anything deliberate - make 
ROSE: But you are seeing communications between them, you are seeing interactions, you are singing physical movement of people at all? 
MILLER: Other than as you know with Russian Imperial movement there have been Westerners that have gone out to some of their training-- 
ROSE: To Crimea as well to fight in Crimea. Do we know who all of those individuals are who have gone to partner with the Russian Imperial movement or (INAUDIBLE) and come back here? 
MILLER: I can't say that we know all of them. 
ROSE: Do you think that's a problem? 
MILLER: It's--it's a problem that we know? 
ROSE: Know, is that a problem? Would you say that we know everyone-- 
MILLER: No. 
ROSE: Or have a--would you say that we have a system in place for those who have gone to try to work with ISIS or al Qaeda? 
MILLER: Like--like Director Wray noted with the communications technology the way it is right now I would like to say we know but I cannot say definitively that we know everyone who has gone overseas to support for an terrorist organizations. 
ROSE: Would you support this administration looking at expanding the list of foreign terrorist organization and SDG organization so as to assist us in fighting this new terrorist threat? 
MILLER: I think we have an extraordinarily robust and solid system for doing that and we look at that regularly to see if we are online correctly, if there are any other organizations that should be designated. 
ROSE: To include those organizations that you just refer to earlier that are not presently on the list? 
MILLER: Correct. 
ROSE: Okay. Thank you. 
THOMPSON: The chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Garcia for five minutes. 
GARCIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to Ranking Member Rogers for the warm welcome, really appreciate aid it as a student of national security, as a former frontline operator and a steward of developing national security technology (INAUDIBLE) it really is an honor to be here especially here in this era of our nation's history. Director Wray, director Miller thank you both for being here today and taking the time to help educate us and keep us--keep us aligned and keep both sides of the aisle informed, really appreciate it. 
Director Wray, I think your comments, the single biggest threat to our nation's security right now is our politicians and government leaders especially at the state and local levels, the city levels to not get their collective programs together and support law enforcement. As my colleague from Mississippi Mr. Guest mentioned it is getting ugly out there. It is getting uglier out there and as leaders of government if we don't back law enforcement, if we don't make it crystal clear unambiguously that we support those who protect us as a nation not just through policy but also through funding then this will get worse so I really appreciate your comments and commitment to that. 
I also appreciate your condemnation of previous abuses of power by - make by your organization and look forward to fixing those--those sins of the past so appreciate you both being here. I would like to prove it to a slightly different conversation and topic if we can. In my district I come from Southern California. We were unfortunately the site of a mass casualty at a local high school where we lost two of our beloved teens less than a year ago. 
Where I come from I was a former naval aviator when we ever--whenever there was a mishap, whenever there was a loss of life we would convene what was called the safety investigation board or review this team would go away for six months, nine months, sometimes they would look at every element that led to the mishap, what the pilot ate, what--what medications he was on, what his family life was like, what his emotional state was, what his mental health state was and they come back to the entire fleet and debrief us on the incident, all of the lessons learned, what went wrong, what went right in some cases, what could--how could we have avoided that situation. In our country we don't seem to have anything like that for what I would call mass casualty incidents. 
[*]GARCIA: We have these fatalities that high schools and we have mass casualties in different types of weapons. We hear about it in the news. It makes frontline stories for a couple of weeks and then it goes away. And besides the close friends and families and communities that are impacted, we simply sometimes don't remember the specifics and the details. 
I guess my question is why don't we have that? Why don't we have sort of eight mass casualties lessons learned report that becomes public domain. We can redact things to protect in and anonymity and protect personal private information, but within that, we can get lessons learned about what this kid was going through, what his parents saw, what tell tales or issues or prevalent, and I bet you we do find common denominators in some of these cases. 
Something that as parents weekend read, something that his teachers we can read, classmates can have access to it and we can all as a nation really understand what led to some of these instances. Why don't we have that? What do we need to do in order to get to that and have it available to all 330 million (INAUDIBLE)? 
WRAY: Well, congressman, I appreciate the question. I think we do have some of that, actually. We at the FBI have done a number of studies of not individual self-contained mass casualty attacks, we've looked at the trend of them. We've looked at their collection, the universe of them over a longer period of time and have generated some--some reports about indicators that might have tipped people off if they had known what to look for. 
And so we've--would try to get some of that information out. A number of the field offices, as I mentioned it, I've visited all 56 of our field officers, met with partners, law enforcement community in each place and a number of offices are doing--FBI offices are doing outreach efforts with schools and neighborhoods in there AOR, their Area of Responsibility two kind of better educate people as to what to look for because one of the things that we have learned, and frankly the same thing applies on a lot of that terrorism incidents is that if you look back, there's almost always someone, a classmate, a family member, at neighbor, a coworker who saw at least with the benefit of hindsight saw a change in behavior, a transformation. 
And you hear a say all the time if you see something say something. Most of us, when we hear that, we picture, you know, the unattended backpack in the bus station. Of course we want people, if they see something to say something there, but we also need people if they see something about somebody to say something. And so the more we can educate people as to behavioral patterns to be concerned about a lot of this is very individualized because people are individualized. And so it's the people who know the baseline behavior of the person to know, wait a minute, this has changed now and I need to--this is something I should be concerned about. I should go to the school security officer, I should contact law enforcement, et cetera. So that's part of it. 
There's also lessons learned in terms of hardening our schools and there's been a lot of work done with our state and local partners on that. So there's kind of an infrastructure piece of it. So there's a lot of work to be done in this space that's going to take kind of a collaborative law enforcement education community partnership. 
GARCIA: Yeah. And I'm out of time, but I'll just say that I think we need a concerted effort to try to make some of those documents and lessons learned truly accessible to every--every American out there so that we're--we're actually benefiting from foresight and not just commiserating on hindsight, you know, I think that's the path forward. So again, gentlemen, thank you for your time. 
THOMPSON: The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan, Ms. Slotkin. 
SLOTKIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses for being here. I really appreciate it. And I know there's been back and forth one whether--whether Acting Secretary Wolf should have been here. Whatever the reason, given that this is a worldwide threats hearing, the secretary should have come here. And this idea that someone under Senate confirmation can't appear is actually factually incorrect. I know that since I was under Senate confirmation when I was called to testify many times. 
Let me ask about--I think, Mr. Wray, you've been really helpful in just being straight and clear about kind of the threats that are going on out there. Can you talk about level of effort on extremist violence, domestic extremist violence? You talked about in this hearing how you're seeing 2019, I think you said, was one of the greatest levels of--of domestic violence we've seen in the country for some time since Oklahoma City. 
Can you tell me how many cases you have opened? And if you don't know the exact number of, just approximately, you have opened on groups that are white supremacists versus groups that are coming from the left. Just level of effort that the FBI is employed right now. 
WRAY: Well, I'm trying to think what I--what I can say, certainly off the top of my head on numbers. I mean, I will say that--let me start with this. As a general rule, we have each year, lately, we've been having roughly 1000 domestic terrorism investigations a year. It's higher than that this year, you know, a good bit north of 1000 this year. 
I know that we've had about 120 arrests for domestic terrorism this year. Now, that number of investigations, the 1000 plus and the 120 arrests, that's domestic terrorism across the board, right? 
SLOTKIN: Yeah. 
WRAY: Everything from racially motivated violent extremists too violent anarchist extremists, militia types, sovereign citizens, you name it. Of the domestic terrorism threats, we last year elevated racially motivated buy land extremism to be a national threat priority commensurate with homegrown violent extremists. That's the jihadist inspired people here and with ISIS. 
SLOTKIN: So let me--because that's important, right, that your--what you're saying is the level of threat from domestic terrorists across the board, regardless of ideology is at the same level as homegrown terrorists that have connections to a foreign terrorist organization. Is that--did I hear you correctly? 
WRAY: Well, we're treating it--we're treating it as a commensurate priority in terms of warranting our intention and resources. 
SLOTKIN: And--but I mean, I'm assuming you're--you're giving it that attention because it deserves that attention because the threat has elevated from a time when--I mean, I'm a former CIA officer-- 
WRAY: --Right, I'm-- 
SLOTKIN: --We were doing a lot of foreign terrorism Nexus stuff, you know, 2005, '6, '7 through the last, you know, 10 years. So it's interesting, I think, that domestic terrorism has elevated in FBI's eyes. I'm just-- 
WRAY: --Yes. 
SLOTKIN: And--and I think the thing that we're all struggling with is, you know, there are these homegrown terrorists of every flavor and type, but just in the number of either cases or arrests, how many of them are white supremacist? What is the if not the exact number, is it the same as other types of domestic terrorism? Is it higher? Just give us a level of--of approximate numbers. 
WRAY: Well, what I can tell you is that within--within the domestic terrorism bucket category as a whole, racially motivated violent extremism is, I think, the biggest bucket within that larger group. And within the racially motivated violent extremist bucket, people ascribing to some kind of white supremacist type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that. 
SLOTKIN: Okay. That's very helpful. 
WRAY: I don't have numbers for you. Yeah. 
SLOTKIN: That--that's very helpful. So they're--the white supremacists are the largest chunk of their racially motivated domestic terrorists. 
WRAY: Yes. Let--but let me also say that--and I would also add to that that racially motivated violent extremists over recent years have been responsible for the most lethal activity in the U.S. Now, this year, the lethal attacks, domestic terrorism lethal attacks we've had have, I think all fit in the category of antigovernment, anti-authority, which covers everything from and anarchist violent extremists to militia types. We don't really think in terms of left right, we just--we have-- 
SLOTKIN: --Yeah, I understand-- 
WRAY: --That's not the way we look at the world. 
SLOTKIN: I understand. And in just my last seconds, I'll be submitting some questions for the record for Mr. Wolf. Commensurate with the--the questions that I submitted to--to Chairman Milley on the role of the Department of Homeland Security in and around our elections and the peaceful transition of power. But thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. In line with Ms. Slotkin's questions, Mr. Wray, you know, Congress passed a law, the data act. It's referred to as the domestic and international Terrorism Act that requires the production of a report identifying everything that Ms. Slotkin talked about. Are you familiar with that? 
WRAY: I am familiar with it, yes, Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: And you know we're three months late on the production of that report? 
[*]WRAY: And so I'm--I'm certainly aware of the report and the requirement I will say that--and I'm aware that it's delayed and behind schedule. I know that the first report of the ones that are called for, it's my understanding it's complete and that it's in the interagency approval process, so it should be forthcoming soon. 
Unfortunately, with COVID--of course when the NDAA was passed, no one anticipated the impact of COVID and the people that--and the impact that would have on our workforce, so that's been a big part of the delay. But I understand the importance of it and I know we've been engaging with--with you and your staff in terms of providing briefings and so forth as well, and we'll get it to you just as fast as we can. 
THOMPSON: Yeah, I think it's important that all members of Congress have access just to the data. And if there are some follow-ups from it, it's fine, but you know, Congress has spoken and--and I--I hope you follow. 
The gentleman recognizes the--chair recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. Katko, for five minutes. 
KATKO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you both for being here today. I appreciate it very much. I spend a lot of my waking hours down here in Washington on anti-terrorism matters an election security and cyber security. So, I can talk to all of you for hours, but I do want to pause for a second, Director Wray, to just come in the work of the FBI agents on a regular basis. You don't hear that enough and you should. 
For 20 years before I came to Congress, I was a federal organized crime prosecutor. And some of the best cases I ever did had heave--heavy involvement by the FBI, including police corruption, political corruption, gang cases, and homicides. And so, I--I just want to commend the staff--the--the--the line agents day in and day out who do all the great work, and I--please condemn my--convey my thank you to them. 
There's plenty of ways I can go here. But one thing that's been gnawing at me and I just want to touch on real quick if I can for both of you because I have another question, and that is when the New York City Police Department was cut by one-sixth or $1 billion of their budget, and knowing that New York City is the primary target in the world for terrorists to attack, I'm just curious if either one of you have had any sort of information or concerns that have risen because of the lack of funding that they now have. We can start with Director Wray. 
WRAY: Well, first let me say I appreciate your kind words about the hard-working men and women of the FBI. We and our folks had a tough job before this year, and certainly COVID it didn't make it any easier. And I'm really proud of the hard work that's gone on in terms of keeping our people and their family safe but not letting up on the mission, and the results are--are pretty extraordinary, frankly. 
As far as New York, as somebody who grew up in New York City and still has, you know, family there, I care deeply about the safety of that city in a very personal way. And--and certainly I don't think it's appropriate for the FBI director to wait into sort of political debates, local or otherwise. But I think our police officers, including the NYD--PD police officers, our extraordinary public servants who have a very, very, very, very tough job to have--to undertake, and I think people really ought to think carefully about the ramifications of making the job harder 
KATKO: Okay. Thank you. Mr. Miller? 
MILLER: Thank you, congressman. And obviously, last Friday as we recognized the 19th anniversary, we--our hearts went out to New York City. And we--we were disappointed we weren't able to go up. But of course, with COVID-19 and whatnot, we--we weren't able to do that. And we're hopeful that next year at the 20th anniversary we'll be in an entirely different place in this global war against terrorism, and we'll have some good news on al Qaeda's demise. 
I just wanted to highlight we have the most unbelievable partnership with the New York--NYPD. We have an analyst, she's magical, embedded into the National Counterterrorism Center. And we talk to NYPD probably three or four times a day. I--I'm not familiar with--in total honesty, I'm not familiar with the cuts; look into that, absolutely. And if there's anything we can do to support, obviously we will because between the joint terrorism task force and NYPD, they're just remarkable partners and we want to help them in any way we can. 
KATKO: Thank you very much. And--and Director Wray, I--I've spent a lot of time on election security. It's one of my greatest concerns, and everything from making sure that--that the machines don't get hacked into, and I'm relatively confident on that, to the high concern I have about the possible obstruction in the process of the--of the election by foreign--foreign actors such as Russia and Iran and China. 
And I'm also concerned about, like in New York State, for example, there's a delay of eight days before they start counting absentee ballots after the election, which delays the results, which delays individuals' belief in the results. And I'm concerned about that. But if I could just ask you this question--I know you testified on a lot of different aspects. What's your biggest concern right now about election security going forward for this fall? 
WRAY: You know, obviously there are a lot of aspects of it that we're concerned about. You touched on some of them. But I think in many ways what concerns me the most is the steady drumbeat of misinformation and--and sort of amplification of smaller cyber intrusions that contribute over time. I worry that they will contribute over time to a lack of confidence of American voters and citizens in the--the validity of their vote. 
I think that would be a perception, not a reality. I think Americans can and should have confidence in our election system and certainly in our democracy. But I worry that people will--will take on a feeling of futility because of all of the noise and confusion that's generated, and that's a very hard problem to combat. 
KATKO: Thank you very much. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver. Mr. Cleaver, you need to unmute yourself. Well--well, we will--well, we will--we'll go to Mr. Green. We'll go to Mr. Green for five minutes. 
AL GREEN: Yes, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? 
THOMPSON: Yes, we have you. 
AL GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the witnesses for appearing and I'm especially interested in a topic related to violent activity. I have in my hand, Mr. Chairman, a story from the Washington Post dated September 14th, 2020. And it is styled, ""Trump Health Appointee Michael Caputo Warns of Armed Insurrection After Election."" 
The relevant portion of the story that is quoted reads, ""And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,"" he warned in video. ""The drills that you have seen are nothing. If you carry guns, by ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it's going to be hard to get."" 
Mr. Director of the FBI, you pride yourself on your independence, do you not? 
WRAY: I--I'm sorry, Congressman. I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the very end of your question. 
AL GREEN: I said you pride yourself on your independence, do you not? 
WRAY: I do pride myself on my independence and my-- 
AL GREEN: --And you-- 
WRAY: --Organization's independence-- 
AL GREEN: --You will--and you will investigate anybody or any opportunity to prevent a crime. Is this correct? 
WRAY: We will follow the facts and law and nothing else, and we will aggressively pursue any criminal activity. 
AL GREEN: Can you explain to me kindly, sir, why you have not pursued the facts and the law as it relates to Mr. Caputo and the statements? He appears to be warning us of some sort of impending crisis related to violence. 
WRAY: Well, I--I don't want to, sir, try to engage in whether or not there's any particular investigative activity going on or--that might be somehow related to all that. What I would say is that we don't investigate rhetoric, and we will investigate when we have proper predication of a federal criminal violation. And you can be sure that-- 
AL GREEN: --Well, if I may ask-- 
WRAY: --We will--you can be assured that we--if-- 
[*]WRAY: --if we have a situation where we have the facts and the law and the evidence then we will pursue it without regard to any other consideration. 
AL GREEN: Permit me to ask this. Mr. Caputo is a part of or was a part of the administration he appears to be on some sort of leave right now, he has indicated that there is going to be violence. It would seem to me that at least an interview would be in order (INAUDIBLE) not interview? 
WRAY: Well congressman I'm not particularly familiar with the public comments that you are referring to but as I have said if we see credible evidence of violent criminal activity that is a federal crime we will pursue that activity. 
AL GREEN: Mr. Chairman, may I kindly insert the Washington Post article in the record without objection? 
THOMPSON: Without objection. 
AL GREEN: Thank you. Back to you again Mr. Director of the FBI my hope is that by calling this to your attention today it will give you sufficient reason, you have got a member of the United States Congress who is bringing to you intelligence that has been reported publicly that a member of the administration has made comments that there will be violence if there is a refusal to stand down by a person who is associated with the presidency. My hope is that this is sufficient for you to at least interviews someone. 
Let me move to the director of national counterterrorism. Could this intelligence not seem to indicate that there may be some sort of activity that would fall under your umbrella if this is credible information, Mr. Director Miller? 
MILLER: Sir, thanks for the question my focus in remit is connections between international terrorist organizations and in the U.S. domestic violent extremist or homegrown violent extremist. 
AL GREEN: I have to ask now rhetorically what--what does it take to investigate someone who is associated with this administration who makes these kinds of comments? This seems to be fairly serious to me. I likely will be at the inauguration and we have a person who is associated with the administration who is indicating that bullets are going to fly and shooting will begin, these are his words. 
It would seem to me that this should be sufficient so I'm going to ask as a member of Congress that the FBI performed its duty as an independent agency fearing none having favor for none investigate this and please report to me if you would if the committee does not desire to know would you kindly report to me what your findings are to the extent that you can? 
I yield back Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes Mr. Cleaver for five minutes. 
CLEAVER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for my technological failure earlier. Let me also first of all say I would like to thank you Mr. Chairman for your leadership. I look at leadership as being measured by how function during a crisis and we are in a crisis and I think magnificently. You know Director Wray let me just say (INAUDIBLE) polarization (INAUDIBLE) is rising frighteningly as at least (INAUDIBLE) and I think it is helping to create a new and growing dangerous tribalism in our country now (INAUDIBLE) people want to live in neighborhoods that are--where people have similar ideologies and we--we (INAUDIBLE) different political (INAUDIBLE) we condemn lying little small circle in which we might function but we except to even when it's down to achieve some political (INAUDIBLE). 
Now let me just say I--I have to say I appreciate you and the way you handled the department. I can tell you I trembled at night because we have seen many of our institutions damaged over (INAUDIBLE) years and people in position of significance have allowed those organizations to bend to the will of politicians and I don't--I have not (INAUDIBLE) started I would like for you to stress if you can you know where the FBI stands in terms of the morale and whether the FBI is now in a situation where we can depend on it to (INAUDIBLE) central objectivity and I also and died just saying that (INAUDIBLE) is something that I want to express appreciation for but where--where is the FBI right now in terms of (INAUDIBLE) out on the streets doing all of the work that we need to get done to protect the United States of America. 
WRAY: Well, congressman, I want to tell you I very much appreciate your kind words to our folks and the question. I will say that I could not be more proud of our people and so whenever you ask questions about something like around it is a hard thing sometimes to measure but I will give you a few pieces of information that I think are extremely good news. One is that last year and this has been a trend over the few years of my tenure as FBI director are our attrition rate is down to 0.45 or 6 percent so well less than 1 percent and there are very few organizations in this country that have an attrition rate that low but an even better piece of news is on the recruiting side. 
Last year we had tripled--tripled the number of people in this country applying and these are qualified applicants to be special agents of the FBI the prior-year the highest number in about a decade and this year we are on track to be even higher and so I think that is a very positive signal about the brand of the FBI and the currency of the FBI out all across the country and among the public. You know but just in the middle of COVID our folks have you know open something like 750 COVID fraud investigations, 600 plus violent gang members arrested just in the course of a single month. I mentioned the terrorist attacks we have thwarted. I think in Fiscal Year 20 we recovered something like 500 plus kids who were victims of human trafficking. I could go on and on and on but they are doing all of that despite the challenges of the current environment and I--I am--I say I am honored but really I'm humbled to be working with them. 
CLEAVER: Thank you. I would also it would have been great if Secretary Wolf had been here. I think unfortunately tragically and painfully his absence does continue to do damage to the democracy. I would like to yield back to you at this time, Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Underwood. 
UNDERWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Your agencies have identified domestic violent extremism particularly white supremacy as a leading threat to our homeland. Last month a teenager from my district in Antioch, Illinois went to Kenosha, Wisconsin where he allegedly killed two people within (INAUDIBLE) style rifle amid the protests there. We have seen too many examples of this kind of deadly violence being fueled by online extremism and now we know that combating extremism requires a thoughtful approach in order to safeguard American civil liberties. 
Director Wray, in explaining the FBI's approach to domestic extremism you said quote the FBI is only concerned with responses from ideas and constitutionally protected protest to violence. In the day before the shootings in Kenosha the Atlantic Council's digital forensic research lab found that so-called militias were publicly organizing on social media for armed individuals to travel to Kenosha. A so-called militia later wrote quote ""law enforcement is outnumbered. (INAUDIBLE) tonight from (INAUDIBLE). Another user wrote quote I am on the way with 75 people from Green Bay. We have lots of guns, lots of pipe bombs, going to cleanse the streets of rioters. 
[*]UNDERWOOD: A third user wrote, ""Attention all nonwhites and degenerates of Kenosha, you have until sundown to pack up your belongings and leave the area. After that, anything that happens to you or your children will beat your fault."" and a fourth quote, ""Shoot to kill, folks."" Director Wray, are these ideas or are they threats of violence? 
WRAY: I'm sorry, congresswoman, the very--the very last part, the question itself, I couldn't quite hear. I'm not sure if it's the audio or-- 
UNDERWOOD: --Director Wray, are these ideas or threats of violence? 
WRAY: Well I--without reference to any specific case, certainly, language about violence can and certain instances be part of the offense and can be a threat. And we pursue threats to commit violence, not just the actual commission of violence. 
UNDERWOOD: To your knowledge, did Facebook at any point provide any of these Kenosha specific threats to federal law enforcement? 
WRAY: I can't, sitting here right now, speak to any specific tips or threats. I will say that we get lots of leads and tips from Facebook and work closely with them on a lot of a lot of terrorism issues. 
UNDERWOOD: In light of the violence that occurred at similar events this year, I think we can all agree that statements like these are concerning and that's why it's so important to share this information as soon as possible with local officials like those in Kenosha so they can make effective plans to keep your community safe. And I want to be clear, I'm speaking here about statements publicly posted online, often or the user's real name's, not about private communications. Director Wray, what steps, if any, did the FBI take to alert state and local officials in Wisconsin about these specific threats of violent activity in their area? 
WRAY: Well congresswoman, there's a few things that I would say on this topic. First, just to be clear, you know we don't have people we had FBI don't have the resources or the authority to just sit on social media and troll for threatening information-- 
UNDERWOOD: --I didn't (INAUDIBLE)-- 
WRAY: --I know you're not--I know you're not suggesting that, but what I'm just making sure that the people out there understand-- 
UNDERWOOD: --Sir, we have limited time. Just answer the question. 
WRAY: I'm sorry? 
UNDERWOOD: We have limited time, if you could answer the question. 
WRAY: But--but--so what we do--do, we have--in addition to the relationships we have with social media companies, we have something called NTOC, which is our National Threat Operation Center that has both call in lines, you know, 1-800 Call FBI, and then email version and we get-- 
UNDERWOOD: --Director Wray, excuse me, sir, I asked if you took steps to alert the local officials. 
WRAY: Yes. And so what I'm getting to is that the National Threat Operation Center, when it gets threats and tips of this sort that you're describing, we have a mechanism--we have a mechanism by which we feed that information as quickly as possible to state and local law enforcement so they can take appropriate action. We have a system called E-Guardian (SP) that does that-- 
UNDERWOOD: --Okay. Reclaiming my time. Reclaiming my time. The director is not answering specifically whether or not this FBI alerted state and local officials in Wisconsin. I'd like that noted for the record. 
The day after the Kenosha shootings, I heard from a mother in the alleged shooter's hometown in my district who wrote that there's a malicious (INAUDIBLE) that's becoming more and more emboldened to take the law into their own hands and I'm becoming fearful to send my children to the same schools as white supremacist militia members. Domestic extremism and white supremacy pose critical threats to our Homeland. 
To stop deadly extremist violence, federal law enforcement and their partners must be sees on opportunities to intervene before the violence begins. And I'm looking forward to working together with you, Director Wray, on improving our ability to prevent violent threats from becoming violent actions. Thank you to our witnesses for being here. I'm so disappointed but not all of our witnesses fulfilled their duty to help this committee and the American people understand the threats to our national security. And I yield back. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The gentle lady yields back. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Clarke for five minutes. 
CLARKE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank our Ranking Member Rogers. As our nation faces immeasurable threats on the rise of white supremacist terrorist groups and the risk of cyberattacks crippling our critical infrastructure. This committee has an obligation to conduct oversight and ensure that the executive branch is doing its job. But Congress can only fulfill our constitutional role if the executive branch follows the law and appears before us when subpoenaed. 
I'd like to thank Director Wray and Director Miller for appearing before us today. I would also like to condemn in the strongest possible terms Mr. Wolf's refusal to appear before us and comply with a lawfully issued subpoena. His refusal to testify is yet another example of the lawlessness that has infected the Department of Homeland security. 
Mr. Wolf may not want to answer for his department's actions for removing the uteruses of ICE detainees to manipulating and intelligence to minimize Russian meddling in our election. But when a congressional committee subpoenas you, the law says you must show up. And with that, I turn to my questions. 
My first question is actually for you, Director Wray and it's a bit parochial. It has to do with my district. Yesterday, I joined a letter to Commissioner Shea of the New York City Police Department signed by two New York State legislators, two members of Congress, and members of the New York City Council regardless--regarding, excuse me, alleged cooperation between the FBI and the NYPD in a community in my district. 
Specifically, it alleged that in light of New York's new state level bail laws, investigations that would have previously been handled by local officials, the NYPD are now being turned into federal cases. Are you aware of any arrangement of this nature between the Bureau and the NYPD? 
WRAY: I'm not familiar with the specific issue that you're referring to at least in New York. I will say that certain-- 
CLARKE: --Okay, will--will you look into it and get back to me on this? 
WRAY: I'd be happy to take a look. You said there was a letter that you'd written for-- 
CLARKE: --Well, this was sent--this was actually sent to our local police commissioner, but the there was a public statement made by one of our police officials that they are working with the FBI. And so I'd like to get some clarity around what this arrangement is, if it exists at all. 
WRAY: Okay, well I'll have my staff follow up with your staff to get a little more information about it and see if there's information that we can provide that would be helpful to you. 
CLARKE: Wonderful. I appreciate that. I'd like to ask a question about the really recent resurgence of white supremacists against African Americans, Jewish Americans, Latinos, and so many others. Politico recently obtained a draft DHS 2020 Homeland threat assessment, which described white supremacists as the deadliest domestic terror threat currently facing the nation. But subsequent drafts diminished this warning. 
What is your assessment of the deadliest domestic terrorist threat currently facing the nation? And have you ever faced political pressure or been received--or have received a request from any other element of the U.S. government to alter the assessment? 
WRAY: Well first, let me say my commitment to calling it straight extends not just to our investigations, but to our intelligence assessments. That's been my commitment since day one and it continues. It will continue as long as I'm sitting in this role. And we have continued to take that approach to all of our intelligence assessments on my watch. 
As far as the--the issue about danger and domestic terrorism threats, what I would say is that we assess that the most dangerous threat to the homeland encompasses lone actors, radicalized often online with easily accessible weapons against soft targets. That includes homegrown violent extremists jihadist inspired as well as domestic violent extremists of all sorts. 
Now, within the domestic violent extremists, we have assessed that racially motivated, racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists is--has been responsible for the most lethal activity over the last several years, and that's why we elevated it-- 
CLARKE: --(INAUDIBLE) I asked specifically about white supremacists. Are they included in that threat assessment? 
WRAY: Yes. So within--within the racially motivated--racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists, the--I would say the biggest chunk of those, I can't give you a percentage, but the biggest chunk of that are individuals who are motivated by some form of white supreme--supremacist ideology. And that's the group, the racially motivated violent extremist has been responsible for the most lethal activity over the last few years. 
[*]WRAY: The lethal attacks that we've seen I think of all been from antigovernment or antiauthority types. But--but if you go back over the last few years, it's been the racially motivated violent extremists that had the most lethal attacks in the--in the homeland. 
THOMPSON: The gentlelady's time-- 
CLARKE: --Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Las Vegas, Ms. Titus, for five minutes. 
TITUS: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? 
THOMPSON: Yes, we can. 
TITUS: Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. Actually, I'm sorry Mr. Wolf wasn't here because I wanted to ask him about a limitation on J-1 visas, which is keeping about--several dozen special ed teachers from coming to Clark County, and I really don't think special ed teachers are a threat to the homeland, but nonetheless. 
Director Wray, despite your protests to the contrary that the FBI is not being politicized, we have seen increasing politicization of the Justice Department under Attorney General Barr. And this has crossed a long-standing line that has not--we don't usually expect or see or tolerate this sort of thing from our nation's law enforcement. 
Just yesterday, the attorney general told the nations federal prosecutors, this is virtually a quote, to be aggressive when charging certain demonstrators with crimes, including the crime of sedition. Now, sedition, as you know, is an act of inciting revolt or violence against a lawful authority with the goal of destroying or overthrowing it. Now, put that in the context of the fact that FBI officials earlier this year described the perpetrators of some of these actions at demonstrations as largely opportunistic individuals taking advantage of the protests. 
Then we had a report by Armed Conflict and Location and Event Data Project, which monitors political upheaval around the world. They looked it 7,750 protests from May 26th to August 22nd in 2,400 locations in all 50 states and in Washington, and found that 93 percent of the protests were peaceful. 
Third, we--we've seen a statement by the formal federal prosecutor--or federal attorney from Eastern Virginia, who said, well, if you're--Eastern District of Virginia, Mr. Rosenberg, who said, if you're--if Barr is saying if you have a sedition case, then bring it, that's okay. But if he's urging people to stretch to bring one, that's deeply dangerous to our Constitution. 
I wonder, if under these new directives from Attorney General Barr, who's apparently trying to shore up the president's law and order image, you're going to change your approach to dealing with some of the people who have been involved in these demonstrations, if you're going to look at building a case for sedition. It's difficult to prove, but maybe you'll set out to do that. Could you kind of describe how this might make a difference in the crimes that you pursue against some of these people? 
WRAY: Well, congresswoman, I'm--I'm not familiar with the--the conversation that's been attributed to the attorney general, you know, in the press. I can't really comment on that specifically. I will say my commitment, our commitment, is to pursue justice in every investigation, to follow the facts, follow the law, and follow proper predication. And we have a commitment to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution. And we're going to do both in every investigation, and that includes in this context. 
TITUS: Could you talk a little bit about the crime of sedition and what it would take to prove it? And do you see any cases pending out there now that might fit under this kind of charge? 
WRAY: Well, I will--I will confess that I'm not a--a legal expert on the crime of sedition. So, I'm not sure that--I would have to brush up on that to be able to really answer your question in the intelligent way that I think you would expect of me. 
Certainly, there is dangerous violent criminal activity that is occurring amidst some of the protests around the country. And we I think have a responsibility to pursue that activity aggressively but appropriately. Even if numerically--even if numerically it may not be the lion's share of the protesters by any stretch of the imagination, it doesn't take more than one person to engage in sometimes lethal activity against others. So, we have a responsibility to pursue that, but you can be confident that we're going to pursue that based solely on the facts and the law and the appropriate evidence, and not based on any kind of improper partisan consideration. 
TITUS: Would you think that Mayor Durkin or Governor Jay Inslee are domestic terrorists because of what's happened in Seattle, as has been suggested perhaps by this administration-- 
WRAY: --I'm not familiar with-- 
TITUS: --Even if they-- 
WRAY: --The particular comments that you're referring to, so I really can't comment on that. 
TITUS: Well, no, I'm just asking do you think they would fit the category of domestic terrorists based on what's been happening in Seattle. 
WRAY: I'm sorry. Do I think who is domestic terrorists? 
TITUS: Mayor Durkin and Governor Inslee. 
WRAY: I--I wouldn't be describing them that way. But I--I will say I don't tend to comment on people as--ascribe labels of terrorist or criminal activity two people except when we're speaking through our charges. That's all I would communicate about that. 
TITUS: I appreciate that. I wish some other members of the administration felt the same way. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
THOMPSON: Thank you. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from New Jersey, Ms. Watson Coleman. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for the service that you render, the job that you do, and your willingness to be here and have an exchange of views. 
Mr. Wray, I have a--a--a series of follow-up questions. Congresswoman Underwood asked you about investigations, and you did not answer whether or not you would be pursuing those investigations at her request. So, is that a yes or no? 
WRAY: I--I will confess, congresswoman, that I was having an extremely hard time hearing Congresswoman Underwood. I don't know if it was the quality of the audio connection or perhaps because she was appropriately wearing a mask that I couldn't hear through the mask. So, I--I will confess that I really couldn't understand the question very well. I was doing my best interest to the best of my ability. So, it probably makes more sense for me to follow up with her staff off-line-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Good-- 
WRAY: --To make sure that I-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Okay-- 
WRAY: --Actually understood the question. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you. What about Congressman Al Green's request that you investigate the statements that Mr. Caputo made while he was a spokesman at the DHS impacting what the CDC was saying, and his notion of there would be violence and that the scientists were actually--I think the terminology is creating--or were seditious in their--and their actions? Will you be investigating that? 
WRAY: Well-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --I know you said you didn't know the comments that were made. But now that you know, will you be investigating that? 
WRAY: Well, first, congresswoman, let me say, as you may know, we don't ever confirm or deny the existence of investigations. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Okay. 
WRAY: And so, when we get--when we get requests from members of Congress to-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Okay-- 
WRAY: --To investigate something, which happens all the time, we-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Yeah-- 
WRAY: --Will take evidence that's submitted. If somebody has credible evidence of-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Okey-dokey-- 
WRAY: --A crime, will review the evidence and decide what to do about it. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Okay. Then can you tell me a couple of things? Number one is do--do you feel that voting by mail as a result of the pandemic and in anticipation of having the largest turnout in voting at a time when we have this pandemic, do you believe that there is widespread fraudulence and abuse historically in voting by mail? That's a yes or no. 
WRAY: Well, I--it's--I'm not sure--with respect, I'm not sure it easily lends itself to a yes or no question, but I will--I will answer the question. We--we take all election related crimes seriously, including voter fraud, whether that's in person or mail-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Well, then I guess my question is--my question is--it is a yes or no question. Is there this sort of--of experience, historical record, of wide--wide--wide abuse--widespread abuse of--of voting by mail? Yes or no? 
WRAY: We have not seen a--to date-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Thank you-- 
WRAY: --A coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election. We have certainly investigated-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: --Okay. Then I simply--yeah-- 
WRAY: --We have certainly invest--if I just may finish, we--we've--certainly have investigated voter fraud committed by mail. It's typically been at the local level. 
WATSON COLEMAN: And--and--and very isolated circumstances, I suspect. I'm just wondering how often you get to speak to the attorney general and if you would use your good graces and the respect that we have for you to--to sort of ask him to stop spreading such misinformation about vote--voting in--voting integrity. 
[*]WATSON COLEMAN: I want to ask you a couple of questions about white supremacist. White supremacist do you--first of all let me ask you about Black Lives Matter. Does Black Lives Matter represent an organization to you? Is that a yes or a no? 
WRAY: I understand that there is an organization that calls itself Black Lives Matter. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Do you have it--okay. Do you have it listed as a terrorist organization? 
WRAY: No. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Do you have any reason to believe that it is a terrorist organization? 
WRAY: Well, we don't--we don't categorize domestic organizations as terrorist organizations under the law because there's no mechanism-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: Have you found--okay, have you found any individuals that have aligned themselves with lack lives matter as the perpetrators of any of the violent actions that you have seen take place in what was peaceful demonstrations organized by Black Lives Matter allies? 
WRAY: I--I can't sitting here right now speak to specific cases. I know that we have had a wide range of domestic violent extremist in midst of the current protest activity engaging in violence or destruction of property and whether in any one of those cases someone may have online themselves or associated themselves with black--sitting here right now I can't think of one but I don't know for sure. 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you. Do you know whether or not they have been aligned with white supremacist, Boogaloo, militia groups or whatever other sort of right-wing groups? 
WRAY: Well, we have had a number of investigations involving some of the activities we are talking about, sort of domestic violent extremism that in some instances as I have mentioned are people who are associated themselves with various anarchist ideologies like pink and in other instances associated themselves with Mike the Boogaloo--Boogaloo for example I mentioned the case in my exchange with Congresswoman Lesko about the Minneapolis individuals for example who associated themselves with the Boogaloo and ultimately were also ensnared in trying to provide an shows support to Hamas and then there are some other cases that we have had involving Boogaloo activity I believe perhaps the individuals who--the individual who killed the FPS officer out in--in Oakland may have referenced Boogaloo inspiration. 
THOMPSON: The gentle lady--the gentle ladies time has expired. The chair-- 
WATSON COLEMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
THOMPSON: Yes. The chair recognizes the gentle lady from Florida, Ms. Demings. 
DEMINGS: Thank you so much Mr. Chairman and thank you to both of our witnesses for being with us today. I do have to say that I am disappointed that assistant Secretary Wolf did not join us today and also ignored our subpoena. I have always expected and kind of prided the fact that the Department of Justice homeland security those in the intelligence agency would act of above the fray, active above politics, keep us safe, hold bad actors accountable and eagerly appeared to tell their own story on behalf of the men and women that they work for and the American people so director Miller and Director Wray, thank you both for being with us today. 
I can also say that I am grateful for the work that the men and women in law enforcement do every day and I can say that and hold them accountable when they are engaged in wrongdoing all at the same time. The men and women in law enforcement do not deserve nor need to be used as political pawns as I believe that we have heard too much today. I think they are clear on who they work for and that is they work on behalf of the American people. 
Before I get into my line of questioning for the reasons we are here today Director Wray following up on my colleague Ms. Titus's line of questioning about the Attorney General's agenda you know we are in a strange place right now and we are just hearing strange things all of the time and what I did here recently the Attorney General say that really concern me he said like I say to the FBI agents whose agents do you think you are. Now Director Wray as we think about law enforcement and the very nonpartisan role that law enforcement is engaged in or should be to alleviate any confusion on behalf of your agents are the American people how do you respond to that comment from the Attorney General? 
WRAY: Well, I'm not familiar with that particular comment from the Attorney General. I will say we, the FBI work for the American people. 
DEMINGS: Okay. Thank you so much for clearing bad out. Secondly, I know both of you have said that pretty much the biggest threat or these persons we would consider as lone wolves, loan individuals, homegrown violent extremist how much would you say that they have taken advantage when we look at the number of protests that we have seen around the country how much would you say and I admit the acoustics were not the best in here? How much would you say that they have taken advantage of the number of protest to really spread their own individual purpose, calls, message and what can we anticipate as we get closer to the election from them? 
WRAY: Well, certainly we have seen a minute some of the protest in some cities at certain times dangerous violent extremism committed by people from a variety of ideology who are hijacking those protest as cover or cover for their own ability to engage in violence and dangerous criminality. I think one of the phenomenons that that lends itself to is not just dangerous to small businesses, dangerous to law enforcement we talked about already but frankly dangerous to the other protesters as well, the people who are there peacefully you know then find themselves you know in the line of fire. 
So it is activity that we need to pursue aggressively using every tool that we--lawful and appropriate tool that we have in the toolbox. I think one of the things that we have started to see more and more of that I am concerned about this goes to your question about what can we expect to see in the future, in addition to people committing violence against government buildings and law enforcement which is a real problem and people need to understand themselves that it's really happening and having real consequences. 
You are also seeing now different violent extremist groups or--or individuals committing violence against each other and other words one group shows up to pick a fight with the other group and who knows which is chicken and which is eggs but now you have got an additional level of combustible violence as opposed to maybe just one category of violent extremist you know hijacking a particular protest now you have both groups from opposite sides adding to the combustibility and the danger of the situation and so we certainly see that in a number of cities and that's a force multiplier in a bad way that I am concerned about going forward. 
DEMINGS: Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, may I ask one more question? Director Miller, in May the acting director of national intelligence conducted a so-called reorganization of the National Center for Terrorism or the National Counterterrorism Center without consulting Congress reportedly cutting resources and staff. What is the impact of the reorganization at the in CTC operation? 
MILLER: Thank you congresswoman and we owe you a briefing on that, be happy to do that. I have been there for five weeks. I thought the reorganization we cleaned up some stuff, I have not other than a few--we had some seats that weren't being filled for a long time so those kind of went away so I have not seen a major--in the major issue at all with their effectiveness or our efficiency. Happy to talk to you more about that. 
DEMINGS: That would be great. So you do commit to working with Congress - Max 
MILLER: Yes, ma'am. 
DEMINGS: --to discuss the resources? 
MILLER: Absolutely. Yes, ma'am. 
DEMINGS: Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
THOMPSON: Thank you very much. The chair recognizes the gentlelady from Texas. 
JACKSON LEE: Mr. Chairman thank you for your generosity. I just want to put on the record one question and introduce elements into the record. Is the DOJ contemplating or has it contemplated opening an investigation into domestic terrorism charges against BLM? I would like to have that on the record for a response by both our witnesses today and Black Lives Matter. And if so, what is the status? 
New York Times--I want to introduce this, New York Times federal officers deployed in Portland didn't have proper training, DHS memo said and I--I will just do unanimous consent at the end, Mr. Chairman. Washington post ICE flew detainees to Virginia so the planes could transport agents to DC protest a huge coronavirus outbreak followed. ABC news death that protest from Kenosha to Portland but motives tell a different story. 
This indicates who are actually involved in that. FBI names QAnon a domestic terrorist threat. Ask unanimous consent. This is a Federal Bureau of Investigation intelligence bulletin May 30, 2019. Esquire, years after being debunked interest in pizzagate is rising again and finally, political divides conspiracy theories and diverted new sources heading into 2020 election. Pew Research Center 43 percent of Republicans identify fraud as a major problem with voting by mail versus 11 percent Democrats. I ask unanimous consent that these be introduced into the record--I am sorry, NPR what is QAnon the conspiracy theory tiptoeing into the Trump world? I ask unanimous consent that these periodicals be submitted into the record along with those questions. 
THOMPSON: Without objection so ordered. I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a statement for the record from Brian Levin(SP) director of the study of hate and extremism at California State University San Bernardino. Without objection, so ordered. 
I think the witnesses for their valuable testimony and the members for their questions. The members of the committee may have additional questions for the witnesses and we ask that you respond expeditiously in writing to those questions. Hearing no further business the committee stands adjourned. "

HOUSE ARMED SERVICE COMMITTEE PROFESSIONAL STAFF MEMBER PHIL MACNAUGHTON 
[*]SMITH: The committee will come to order. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: Yes. Mr. Thornberry is recognized. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. Does the chair agree with me that we have a quorum of the committee physically present in the room? 
SMITH: Yes, we do. We have just--just about everybody here, so we have a physical quorum. 
THORNBERRY: Thank the chair. 
SMITH: Thank you. There's a fair amount of preliminary statements to make here, so I'm going to get through those. And then I'll turn to the opening statement that I have, an opening statement of Mr. Thornberry, and then we'll get rolling through our subcommittees. 
So the committee will now markup H.R. 6395, the National Defense Authorizing Act for Fiscal Year 2021. I'd like to welcome the members who are joining today's markup remotely. Just about everybody is here physically present, but we do have some members who are participating remotely. We have done a hearing doing this before, and it worked quite seamlessly. 
So I think the process is well set up, and I will do this in more detail in a minute. But I do want to thank the staff. In fact, if we could just pause for a moment and give the staff a round of applause, I think that would be very appropriate. 
(APPLAUSE) 
This was not easy to set up. Those members that are participating remotely are reminded that they must be visible on screen within the software platform for the purposes of identity verification when joining the proceeding, establishing and maintaining a quorum, participating in the proceeding, and voting. 
Members who are participating remotely must continue to use the software platform's video function while attending the proceedings, unless they experience connectivity issues or other technical problems that render the member unable to fully participate on camera. If a member who is participating remotely experiences technical difficulties, please contact the committee staff for assistance, and they will help you get reconnected. 
When recognized, video of remotely attending members' participation will be broadcast in the room and via the television Internet feeds. Members participating remotely are asked to mute their microphone when they are not speaking. Doing so will help to ensure that the remote technology works properly. Members participating remotely will we recognized if they are visible and seek recognition verbally. 
In all cases, members are reminded to unmute their microphone prior to speaking. That sounds like sound advice. Members should be aware that there is a slight lag of a few seconds between the time you start speaking and the camera shot switching to you. Members who are participating remotely are reminded to keep the software platform's video function on for the entirety of the time they attend the proceeding. Those members may leave and rejoin the proceeding. 
If members depart for a short period for reasons other than joining a different proceeding, they should leave the video function on. If members will be absent for a significant period or depart to join a different proceeding, they should exit the software platform entirely and then rejoin it if they return. Members are also advised that I have designated a committee staff member to, if necessary, mute unrecognized members' microphones to cancel any inadvertent background noise that may disrupt the proceeding. 
Members may use the software platform's chat feature to communicate with staff regarding technical or logistical support issues only. Remotely participating members should see a countdown clock on the software platform's display, but if necessary, I will remind members when their time is up, and you all know I will not be shy about doing that. 
For the purposes of voting, remote members are reminded that they must unmute themselves to vote. For voice votes, I will pause for a few seconds when asking for votes, to ensure remote members' votes have been heard. For roll call votes, remote members are requested to both say their name and how they vote. Doing so will help to ensure that the clerk can properly record your vote. 
Remote members must be visible to me on the screen to vote. Remote members who experience connectivity issues or other technical problems that render the member unable to fully participate on camera will not be able to vote. And that, believe it or not, is all the preliminary procedurals. 
I want to start my opening remarks where I started earlier, thanking the staff, but specifically thanking Zach Steacy, Everett Coleman, and Doug Bush, who took the lead and put together this entire room; made the microphones work, got the remote video set up. We've been working on this for some time, and I really want to thank the three of them for their outstanding work. 
As I say over and over again in this process, the best thing about this committee is the staff. The consistency, the professionalism, the experience, serves us all in this country incredibly well, and that has never been more true that in the last three months--four months now. So thank you. Again, I really appreciate that. 
I do not have a long opening statement. It's going to be a long day. There's a lot of work to do here. Passing the defense bill every year is--is a challenge. And this year, of course, it's even more difficult, given the realities of COVID-19 and everything we've had to do to respond to it. But I do want to reiterate how important this process is and why I think it is just the best representation of the way Congress should and does work. 
In this committee in a bipartisan way, we debate the Defense Authorization Bill, which provides for $741 billion this year for defense, and does the oversight function that Congress needs to do on the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy within our national security budget. That's not easy, but we do it every year. And we do it every year because of a bipartisan commitment to work the legislative process the way it's supposed to be worked. We have very good debates, we have robust disagreements, but we keep the process moving forward. 
And every year for 59 straight years, we've been able to pass this bill. That's the way legislation is supposed to work. You know, we work it through committee off the floor. The Senate does the same. We go to conference. We come up with a product, and we pass it on to the president. I think it's incredibly important that we do that every year. 
It's even more important that we get it done this year, that we show despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, by our economic impacts, that we still get our job done and we still know how to work this process. So it's incredibly important that we get that done. 
And the only last thing I'll say, there are a lot of provisions in this bill, and we'll debate a lot more throughout the course of this day. But at the end of the day, what we're doing is we are exercising our oversight as Congress over national security. As I said, primarily Department of Defense, little piece of the Department of Energy. Enormously important that Congress does that. 
For all the different ins and out of the provisions, us continuing to exercise our oversight authority, to authorize what we do on national security, is incredibly important. I look forward to working with all of you again this year to get that done over the course of the next several hours. Well, maybe more than several hours. Quite a few hours, let's put it that way. 
With that, I look forward to the process, and I turn it over to Ranking Member Thornberry for his opening remarks. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start making a few comments on process before I turn to substance. Every member on this side of the aisle opposes remote participation in today's markup and in all of Congress' proceedings. We have one of our members who recently became a father. He's not here. He's where he should be with his wife and child, but he will not try to debate or vote remotely, even though he has a very good reason for not being here, out of respect for the institution and the process. 
And the point I want to make is there's always going to be a good reason to not be physically present. But remote participation degrades the legislative process, especially today, where we set for hours listening to each other, learning from each other, and finding a way to come together. I hope my Republican colleagues won't mind if I relay that last week, we had a Republican meeting to go over the markup and talk about different issues that we expected to be debated. 
On the issue of renaming bases, we had a very heartfelt discussion where you could hear a pin drop, as members from different parts of the country described what they were hearing at home, members with different backgrounds, military, not military, talked about their viewpoint. I don't know if anybody's position was fundamentally changed. I do know everybody left with a greater understanding of--of this issue, and that's what Congress was designed to do and be. And you can't do that remotely. 
So I just want to start out by saying it's going to be easy to extend this beyond COVID. There's always going to be a good reason not to be here. But I would ask my colleagues to be on guard about this process, about how special it is in this committee but also the Congress as a whole. 
Now, despite our concerns about remote participation, as you can see, all Republicans are here. We're ready to work. We're ready to work together constructively and to participate. And I want to start--or I want to continue that by saying I really appreciate the job that Chairman Smith has done in navigating this committee through times that none of his predecessors have had to deal with. 
I agree with you completely about the staff. They have been amazing at figuring out logistics, dealing with members who were grumbling about phone calls that dropped, and all of that. But the chairman has really led this effort to figure out a way, right at the height of the time when we had to have hearings and come together and draft a bill, and I don't know how it could've been done better. And I appreciate the consultation, the working together, to get that done. 
On the substance of the bill, it seems to me there's been a genuine effort on both sides to work together to get a product that we can support, and I hope that will continue today through the floor and into conference. There have been literally hundreds and hundreds of provisions that were suggested, requested, by members of this committee that are in the underlying bill, many more in amendments we'll adopt, other amendments we will debate. 
I appreciate the contributions of every single member of this committee. Again, that's part of what makes this so special. And I fully agree with the chairman that of all our 60 years, it may be as important this year, with all the tumultuous times around us, that we come together and are able to work together to get a defense authorization bill signed into law for the 60th time. I think the country and our military need to see and hear that. 
Just a couple more comments. I support the top line that is consistent with the two-year budget agreement. I also know, as most of my colleagues know, that the military has had direct and indirect costs that are not reflected in that number. And Ellen Lord, among others, has helped us understand some of those additional costs. 
And then the rest of the story is, the world is not going to be safer after COVID. In fact, it looks like it may be the other way around. It may be more dangerous as we read headlines of the day. I still think it's good to stick to this number, do everything we possibly can to get our bill done on time, and a matching appropriation bill done on time. And then as and when further COVID supplementals come across the floor, that we address other costs there. 
But I'd just remind everybody that shortchanging servicemembers, in either time through CRs or money, has tragic consequences. And I can't help but just remind members of an article that appeared yesterday in Military Times, and let me just read the first sentence. The military services saw an overall decline in the number of serious aviation mishaps and aviation-related fatalities in 2019, reversing a trend in recent years that saw record high numbers of serious aviation mishaps and deaths in recent years. 
And then it goes on to talk about the details by service, and it goes on to talk about this committee and the work that we have done together to help turn that around. So working together, getting things done, saves lives. This is the latest example of how that can happen. 
Two brief concerns. There are obviously some choices made in the chairman's mark that I would not have made. I just want to highlight reductions in the requested funding for partner forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. As we cut our forces in these locations, we are more dependent on our partner forces to protect our guys than ever before. And I worry about cuts that make it harder or less likely or riskier for--for that to happen. 
I'm also concerned about extraneous issues in our bill. I know from experience that this is only going to get worse as the process moves forward. And particularly this year when there are so few legislative vehicles, everybody's going to want to hitch their wagon to us. 
And the danger is that it tends to bog our bill down with all these extraneous issues that have nothing to do with the Department of Defense or our military. We have to always remember that our foremost obligation is to America's national security and the men and women who provide it. Nothing should distract or undermine our ability to carry out that mission. 
And if that continues to be our guide, then I'm sure today will be a success and that we will fulfill our duty for the 60th time. And the country will benefit as a result. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Thornberry. I appreciate that, and I appreciate the partnership that we've had, both when you are chairman and now as ranking member. I think it's really helped the process move forward. I should point out on the remote voting that the rules in the House are very specific. The only reason that a member can participate remotely is because of the coronavirus; if basically, they are concerned about their individual health in being present. 
So actually, under the rules, Mr. Gallagher--and I've been there. It's been a long time ago now, but when I had my children, I missed substantial numbers of votes as well. But that's not a reason to participate remotely. So if any of you are thinking of like just ducking out because you're getting tired of us, that's not actually within the rules. It's only supposed to be coronavirus related. 
All right. So the order of consideration for today's markup of H.R. 6395 will follow our subcommittee structure, and we will begin first with the subject matter that falls under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces, followed by Seapower and Projection Forces, Intelligence and the Emerging Threats and Capabilities, then Readiness, then Personnel, then Strategic Forces, and finally the full committee. 
For members' information, we talked about this a little bit, but I want to make sure everyone's aware. Most of the votes are going to come later in our committee. We're trying to negotiate our way through votes on the floor, which are going to come, I gather, at like 1:00 or 1:30, and you are all now familiar with how long that process takes. It is my intention to keep the committee working through those floor votes. Given the 40 to 45-minute space we have there, if we sort of come and go in a reasonable fashion, and if you make sure you're here if you wish to speak or if you have an amendment, I believe we can do that. 
Now, if for some reason it turns out we can't, we'll take a recess. But I want to give that a try, because it is my goal to get done today. I know we noticed--well, get done without going in too far into Thursday, let's put it that way. So we have tomorrow reserved and if we have to come back tomorrow, we will. But it is our goal to make this a one-shot markup, again, to get through that process. 
I will say I'm not going till 7:00 in the morning this time. That was--that was a one-time deal, which you can all be proud that you experienced. We're not doing it again. If it gets to be, you know, 11:00, midnight, it looks like we've got six, seven hours to go, we're coming back tomorrow. 
But we're going to try to work through the votes in that fashion, and the one thing, we will not have our votes while we're also voting on the floor. We're going to make sure those are separate so members can be here and be focused on that. So that is the plan going forward, to make sure that we get through all of that. 
So let me get to where we're at here. So as we're rolling through this, if a member has an amendment that involves the jurisdiction of other committees, we request that the member before he or she offers the amendment have a letter from the respective committee chair indicating their waiver or the right of referral. In other words, if the amendment added would require us to refer the bill to another committee, we don't do that unless you get a waiver from that committee saying they will not require that referral. 
I note I impose the same requirement both including--sorry, what do I do here? I note I impose the same requirement for including language in the underlying mark. I remind members that this approach has been the practice of the committee for many years. It is done so that we can proceed directly to the House floor without our bill being sequentially referred to other committees. 
Also, it is the practice of the committee that amendments involving additional spending should identify suitable offsets. Members must not offer amendments--members must not offer amendments that could result in a point of order against-- 
UNKNOWN: We can't hear you. 
SMITH: All right, let me try it this way. It has the added benefit that I can see now. All right, I'll start up again here. Members must not offer amendments that could result in a point of order against H.R. 6395 on the House floor during its consideration. Pursuant to the guidelines on submitting amendments sent to member offices last week, we will not permit any earmarks in the National Defense Authorizing Act for Fiscal Year 2021. 
Without objection, members have five legislative days within which to submit written statements into the record. Hearing no objection, so ordered. 
Before beginning with the subcommittee reports and in following consultation with Mr. Thornberry, I ask unanimous consent that the provisions contained in the reports of the subcommittee in the chairman's mark, which includes full committee provisions, be considered for the purposes of this markup as original text of H.R. 6395, and that these provisions be considered as having been read and that the bill be open to amendment at any point. 
Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. And without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. 
One quick note. It is required within the hearing room for members to wear face masks. So I see everyone is doing that; that's outstanding. If you, as I just experienced, if you have a hard time being heard when you're talking into the microphone, perfectly understandable to take the mask off and speak at that point. I appreciate everyone's cooperation on that. 
So now, we move on to our first subcommittee. The committee will now receive the report of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all of the recorded votes on the amendments of this particular subcommittee mark until consideration of all amendments of this subcommittee mark has concluded. 
The chair recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Mr--the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Norcross, for any comments he would like to make. 
NORCROSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee marked now before the members of the full committee, as a result of much hard work in very unusual and demanding circumstances. And I want to first thank the members of the committee for coming together. This is a committee that has had a tradition that continues to work together. You don't have to compromise your values in order to compromise on an issue and come together. I especially want to thank Ranking Member Mrs. Hartzler and her staff for that cooperation. 
Despite these challenges imposed by COVID, we've also been working remotely for oversight. Members and staff gained information necessary to build what we believe is the mark before you, which is thoughtful and comprehensive. Our consideration of the department's request on how best to meet the current and future modernization needs also gives strong consideration to the committee's members' top priorities. 
In that regard, the subcommittee's recommendations carefully manage how to equip, modernize, our military while increasing the need for oversight, to ensure accountability and execution of the Department of the Defense programs, especially focuses on the following: aggressive oversight on the Stryker--the strike fighter aircraft programs, including the most expensive program in the history of DOD, the F-35 and also the F/A-18. 
Particular attention was given to the development, sustainment, and management of manned and unmanned Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft, as well as meeting the combatant commanders' requirements. Continued oversight of the Army's new modernization strategy, including the CH-47 Chinook and the tactical vehicles' air and missile defense network. 
Members have also seen by now the recommendations that support careful oversight and resources of the tactical and rotary aviation, ISR armor, certainly the critical munitions, and obviously the risk of our defense industrial base. 
Again, I want to thank our ranking member, and finally to the subcommittee staff who have done an incredible job under difficult circumstances. Bill Sutey, Heath Bope, Carla Zeppieri, Liz Griffin, Jesse Tolleson, and our clerk, Caroline. I do want to add one other thing. My personal staff with Ryan Ehly, and for my Army fellow Captain Craig Overholt, who today becomes Major Craig Overholt. So I want to congratulate him and his family for doing a great job. 
And with that, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Norcross. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Tac Air and Land Forces, the gentlewoman from Missouri, Mrs. Hartzler, for any comments she would like to make. 
HARTZLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start by thinking Donald Norcross for his leadership and his strong spirit of bipartisanship in building this subcommittee mark. This mark addresses the bipartisan priorities of our subcommittee members. I also want to express my appreciation to all the members of the subcommittee for their active participation in the process this year, and for their valuable contributions that directly informed this bipartisan mark. 
In building the mark, the subcommittee conducted oversight on approximately $118 billion in program budget authority for fiscal year 2021, covering almost every domain of combat capability. I believe this mark will advance the progress we have made over the last several years in restoring readiness and modernization consistent with the objectives of the National Defense Strategy to maintain credible deterrence. 
As such, the mark rightfully manages operational risk in fighter force structure requirements, and strongly supports the need for a highly capable mix of fourth and fifth generation fighters. Through oversight, the mark takes the necessary actions to set better conditions going forward to mitigate shortfalls in the Navy's strike fighter inventory. And the mark also supports the F-35 joint strike fighter, and we all understand the critical need for this program. 
Building off previous committee oversight, and the mark works to ensure that the F-35 will have a successful full rate production decision, as well as a fully reliable and affordable plane for the future. I'm also pleased this mark takes appropriate steps to manage risk in airborne ISR, capability and capacity, and requires more detailed certifications and justification for decisions related to retiring these critical platforms without a suitable replacement. 
Finally, I'd also like to express my thanks to the subcommittee staff for their hard work and their dedication throughout the process, to include Jesse Tolleson, Bill Sutey, Heath Bope, Carla Zeppieri, Liz Griffin, and Caroline Kehrli. I also want to mention my MLA and LD, Chrissi Lee, and my military fellow Tom Spellman. 
Mr. Chairman, the subcommittee's mark is a good step in the right direction and reflects strong bipartisanship. I encourage everyone's support, and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Before the entertaining of amendments, is there any discussion on the committee's report? Hearing none, we will now consider en bloc package number 1. The chair recognizes Mr. Norcross for the purposes of offering the amendment. 
NORCROSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number one, consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. 
SMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? So these amendments will now be appearing on your handy-dandy little tablet in front of you, as we did the last--last year? Well, it was a couple of years anyway--as opposed to passing out paper. So as long as everyone has that in front of them. Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. 
And the gentleman is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of explaining the en bloc amendment. 
NORCROSS: Thank you. It consists of the following: Log 8r1 by Representative Slotkin, Log 49 by Representative Brown, Log 117r2 by Representative Kelly, Log 118r2 by Representative Kelly, Log 152r2 by Representative Kelly, Log 195r2 by Representative Abraham, Log 242r2 by Representative Wittman, Log 244r1 by Representative Hartzler, Log 245r1 by Representative Hartzler, Log 268 by Representative Scott, Log 271r2 by Representative Bishop, Log 273 by Representative Cheney, Log 337r1 by Representative Mitchell, Log 349 by Representative Wilson, Log 398r2 by Representative Banks, Log 431r2 by Representative Gallagher, Log 519 by Representative Brooks, Log 558r1 by Representative Turner, Log 579r2 by Representative Bergman, Log 580r1 by Representative Kelly, Log 582r1 by Representative Brown, Log 619r1 by Representative Waltz, Log 624 by Representative Horn, Log 631r1 by Representative Sherrill. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: Is there further discussion on the en bloc package? And people will have to help me to make sure we recognize anyone. You're more spread out than usual, so if someone does have something to say, make sure I'm aware of it. If not, the question is on the adoption of the en bloc package offered by Mr. Norcross. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed, no. 
UNKNOWN: Aye.(PH)
SMITH: Sorry. Excuse me a second here, my glasses are now caught in my mask. That was something that I read and should have made note of. When we do that, I'm going to have to pause for a second to let the people who are participating remotely speak. Also, I think someone has neglected to re-mute themselves, so if they could do that remotely, that'd be great. 
The ayes have it, and the amendment is adopted. Okay. Sorry, where are we at now? If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Norcross, for the purpose of offering a motion. 
NORCROSS: Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt the subcommittee's report of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land as amended. 
SMITH: Questions on the motion of the gentleman from New Jersey. So many as in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. A quorum being present, the ayes have it and the motion is adopted. The committee will now receive the report of the Committee on Seapower and Projection Forces. Pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all the recorded votes on the amendments for this particular subcommittee mark until consideration of all amendments to the subcommittee mark has concluded. 
The chair recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Courtney, for any comments he would like to make. 
COURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to offer the subcommittee mark for Seapower and Projection Forces portion of the Fiscal Year 2021 NDAA. Mr. Chairman, Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states, ""Congress shall have the power to provide and maintain a Navy."" This subcommittee's mark executes that directive with a bipartisan bill that as in years past will truly make a difference in our nation's seapower and projection forces policy. 
I want to thank my colleague and good friend, Ranking Member Rob Wittman, for his partnership in this process, and to all our members on both sides of the aisle for your constructive input into this year's mark. 
Going back to last February's budget, it became immediately clear that we were facing a daunting challenge in our subcommittee's jurisdiction. Airlift and sealift were under-resourced, the Navy's shipbuilding budget was cut by 17 percent from last year, the request for new ships as verified by the Congressional Research Service was actually seven, the lowest since 2009. And the statutory requirement for the Defense Department to submit a 30-year shipbuilding plan was and continues to be brazenly ignored. 
Thankfully, our mark is actually aligned to the Navy's actual requested priorities that were not included in last February's budget. Our mark recommends that the Navy procure eight new battle force ships, one more than originally requested. This includes the first Columbia-class fleet ballistic missile submarine, two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers, two Virginia-class subs, one fast frigate, and two towing salvage and rescue ships. 
Additionally, as a cosponsor I look forward to an amendment that will soon be offered by Mr. Byrne, that will bring the total to nine with the procurement of a high-speed EPF ship. The mark reverses one of the most confounding elements of this year's budget, the elimination of a Virginia-class submarine which would disrupt the two-a-year build rate for the first time in a decade. 
Since 2011, our subcommittee and Congress has diligently sustained the two-sub build rate as a way of mitigating the decline in our submarine fleet, and has already previously approved $1.1 billion to support a second 2021 submarine. 
We have heard from Navy officials again and again that their number one--that there is industrial base capacity to support a second submarine in 2021, and that restoration of that platform is their number one unfunded priority that represents the most cost-effective and least disruptive way to mitigate our declining fleet. 
Last week, the Navy announced a milestone $10 billion contract to begin work on the first two Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines, the culmination of a decade of preparation that goes back three administrations. In our mark, we authorize that contract by legislating incremental funding within the national sea-based deterrence fund. 
And I would like to pause here for a second and just direct a question to Mr. McNaughton from our subcommittee staff because, again, a kind of intuitive logical question is being asked about whether or not these two muscle movements, which are substantial, whether or not we are going to inhibit or hinder in any way the Columbia program, which is clearly a top priority in terms of our triad. And I would yield to Mr. MacNaughton just to respond to that question. 
MACNAUGHTON: Yes sir, Mr. Chairman. Because of the multiyear contract that the Virginia class is under, if the second FY21 vote is not authorized and appropriated, the shipbuilders will continue to build a second Virginia starting in FY21, because of the multiyear. So they will essentially be bringing work forward under that contract. 
The result of that will be if they maintain the current schedule that they are, or if they recover schedule as they're planning to do, by the time they get to the end of FY23, they will run out of Virginia-class work to start. And due to the nature of the contract they have with their unions, they are required if there is a reduction in workforce to lay off the most recent hires. And that will be the second year of production on the Columbia-class submarine. 
So the result will be they will actually have to be laying off a--workers that they had intended to hire for Columbia due to the result--due to the reduction in Virginia-class work. So if a second submarine is not authorized or appropriated in FY21, we'll see a potentially impact to Columbia in FY23. And at that point, there's very few levers for the Navy to pull to try and help that workforce and help correct the Columbia. 
COURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. MacNaughton. And again, that extends to shipyards in Virginia, New England, and actually 48 states that are part of the supply chain that again are going to be instrumental in terms of that program. 
In regards to projection forces, we were asked to cut aerial refueling and tactical airlift in return for investments in new high-end capacity. The problem is, as Mr. Wittman I think can powerfully state, that new capacity is not operationally ready. So this mark prudently reduces the number of KC-46As to a minimum contractually allowed sustained production rate until the new vision system is--is actually fixed. And we will ensure that our legacy capability is in place until the Air Force and industry partners deliver a working tanker. 
We also established a statutory requirement-- 
SMITH: I'm sorry, Mr. Courtney, your time has expired. And if you'd want to wrap up just quickly, that's fine. 
COURTNEY: Great. 
SMITH: The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Wittman, for any comments he would like to make. 
WITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Seapower and Projection Forces mark is a strong bipartisan mark. Chairman Courtney has done an exceptional job of truly advancing the interests of the Seapower and Projection Forces' efforts. This mark seeks to rapidly expand unique asymmetrical advantages the U.S. maintains over peers, and seeks to impose a cost imposition strategy with these investments. Preeminent in this mark is the inclusion of an attack submarine, the number one unfunded request by CNO Gilday. 
We also include critical capabilities to expand undersea strike with six P-8 Poseidon aircraft in advancing a future attack submarine design. This mark is equally about providing support to the Army. I previously opined that we can have the world's best Army forces, but if they can't get to a contingency in the time frames expected, what good are they? 
We seek to address some of these concerns by authorizing the purchase of four used sealift vessels, the authorization of a tanker security program, and the establishment of a C-130 aircraft for structure floor. While this is a good start, I continue to believe that Army needs to invest significant capital and logistics to better manage lift requirement. 
Finally, this mark is about oversight. We curtailed the KC-46A, an aircraft that is replete with deficiencies, including an ineffective remote visioning system, a refueling boom that is so stiff it may go through the canopy of an A-10, tanks that leak excessive fuel, and a habitual foreign object debris manufacturing defect that continues to manifest itself today. 
Additionally, we limit the procurement of large unmanned surface vessels until basic unmanned concepts are demonstrated. The department can do better, and it's our job to make sure they do. This seapower mark, and as I review the chairman's mark, are worth supporting. I'm also cautious as we continue to review amendments for our consideration that can be very divisive. 
As we move deeper into the markup, I am reminded of a quote by a more contemporary book, The Lord of the Rings. In the book, a group of varied interests align in a common purpose, and are contemplating whether they have the will to overcome an evil so great that it seeks to completely wipe out their civilization. One of their companies opine, the quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little, and it will fail to the run of all. Yet hope remains while the company is true. 
My friends, this is a good mark. Chairman Smith and Chairman Courtney should be commended for their leadership in giving us a mark worth supporting. My fear is that we will be considering a number of potentially divisive amendments over the next few days. While my hope to vote for an NDAA remains true, I am concerned divisive tendencies could prevail to the run of all. 
We should all be reminded that the purpose of our quest is to pass a bipartisan mark that can overcome dithering forces that seek to weaken our national security and our nation's resolve. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Before entertaining amendments, is there any discussion on the subcommittee report? Hearing none-- 
LURIA: Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: --we will now consider en bloc package number--oh, sorry. Where are we at here? Ms. Luria. Ms. Luria is recognized for five minutes. 
LURIA: Thank you for yielding, Chairman Smith. As vice chair of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Courtney and Ranking Member Wittman on putting together a strong mark for this year's NDAA. The strong shipbuilding and maintenance authorizations provide certainty for the industrial base that ensures our fleet is ready for tomorrow to fight and to win. 
I'm particularly pleased that's the chairman's mark restores full funding to the second Virginia- class submarine and the advance procurement to maintain the two-ship per year build rate. Without a naval force structure assessment or an updated 30-year shipbuilding plan, it is impossible for Congress to provide adequate oversight of the Navy's budget. And this bill contains strong language to compel the Navy to provide these guiding documents to this committee prior to making changes to their force structure. 
I'm proud to support the seapower mark, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes. 
SMITH: Thank you. Is there further debate on the subcommittee mark? Seeing none, we will now consider en bloc package number one. The chair recognizes Mr. Courtney for the purposes of offering the en bloc amendment. 
COURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number one, consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. 
SMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. And the gentleman from Connecticut is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of explaining the en bloc amendment. 
COURTNEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. En bloc package number one is comprised of the following: Log 20 by Rep. Gallagher, Log 44 by Rep. Brown, Log 67 by Rep. Conaway, Log 70r1 by Rep. Conaway. Log 96 by Rep. Horn, Log 113r4 by Rep. Kelly, Log 116r1 by Rep. Kelly, Log 172 by Rep. Luria, Log 289 by Rep. Brindisi, Log 319r1 by Rep. Kelly, Log 324r1 by Rep. Larsen, Log 357 by Rep. Wittman, Log 400r1 by Rep. Norcross, Log 457 by Rep. Luria, Log 466 by Rep. Garamendi, and that's all. 
SMITH: Is there--is there any further discussion on the en bloc package? If not, the question is on adoption of the en bloc package offered by Mr. Courtney. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: So many as are opposed will say no. The ayes have it, and the amendment is adopted. Okay, we will now consider Log number 311. For what purposes does the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi, seek recognition? 
GARAMENDI: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. The chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi, for the purposes of explaining his amendment. Mr. Garamendi, you're recognized for five minutes. 
GARAMENDI: Chairman, I'll make this very quick. I want to commend Mr. Courtney and Wittman and their committee for moving very aggressively forward to develop the capacity of the Navy to move personnel and material around the world when needed. They've made enormous progress on this. 
This issue has been before this House and this committee for several years now. It's called the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Industry. Basically, it require that a small portion of our exported natural gas and oil be on American-built ships. It would add significantly to the capacity of the maritime industry to meet the needs of the military, should that ever be required. 
However, this amendment has a problem. and it's called the Energy and Commerce Committee. And we have not yet received a waiver from that committee and, therefore, the amendment would have to be withdrawn, unfortunately. 
So with that, unless somebody wants to chime in and give strong support, I withdraw the amendment. 
SMITH: The amendment is withdrawn. If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Courtney, for the purposes of offering a motion. 
COURTNEY: Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt the subcommittee report of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces as amended. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion from the gentleman from Connecticut. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. A quorum being present, the ayes have it, and the motion is adopted. 
All right. The committee will now receive the report on the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all of the recorded votes on the amendments of this particular subcommittee mark until consideration of all the amendments of the subcommittee mark has concluded. 
The chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin for--I'm sorry, the chair recognizes the chair of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin, for any comments he would like to make. Mr. Langevin, you are recognized for five minutes. 
LANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you on an impressive year in your leadership, and I want to thank also Ranking Member Thornberry. I'm pleased to present the Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee's portion of Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. 
I want to extend, first of all, my sincerest thanks to Ranking Member Stefanik for outstanding bipartisanship and for support for the sound, transparent collaboration between she and I, and members on the subcommittee and our staffs. I also want to thank our subcommittee members whose diligence and oversight and in crafting meaningful new policy is reflected in this mark before us today. 
And, of course, I must acknowledge the IETC staff, Staff Director Shannon Green, Eric Snelgrove, Josh Stiefel, Jessica Carroll, Bess Dopkeen, Joshua Schmidt, Caroline Kehrli; and on my staff, my MLA, Caroline Goodson, and my military legislative fellow, Matt Lake. 
With that, Mr. Chairman, we began this year focused on the many threats from malign actors that destabilize the international order. From interference in democratic institutions to disruptions of critical infrastructure, cyberattacks, gray zone activities, and continued development of weapons of mass destruction. We suddenly found ourselves in a crisis, the likes of which we have not seen in a century. 
The novel coronavirus pandemic has taken over 125,000 American lives and upended our way of life. It reminds us that we must confront challenges before they become crises. To that end, the subcommittee mark reflects our steadfast commitment to ensuring that the Department of Defense plans for, invests in, and matures the critical warfighting and deterrence capabilities to maintain our technological edge, protects and secures supply-chain capabilities and information, and postures the joint force effectively against current and future threats. 
We have prioritized spending to the highest priority requirements. First of all, we restored $135 million in funding to the Cooperative Threat Reduction account, fixing a devastating cut in the president's budget, and add over $50 million in funding for investments and efforts in biotechnology and pandemic preparedness. This mark adds nearly $600 million in science and technology funding, as addressing the challenge from rising science powers requires an ambitious plan of national investment, including in social science research programs like Minerva. 
Central to our thesis on the R&D side of the IETC mark is the great power competition, is also a race for talent. This mark ensures our special operations forces remain a professional, agile, and ready resource for high-end missions to protect our national security, while at the same time continuing their progress towards addressing the strategic challenges posed by China and Russia. And it supports funding for weather and climate research that advances the Intelligence Community's analysis and estimate capabilities in the area of environmental and climate security. 
Our subcommittee mark promotes the alignment of intelligence and security capabilities to the National Defense Strategy. And I'm particularly proud of its incorporation of a remarkable number of recommendations prepared by two commissions, comprised of some of our nation's most forward-thinking defense experts and futurists. 
The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence's work will lay the foundation for the country's workforce, ethics, and security requirements, as machine learning and artificial intelligence tools become more prevalent across societies. 
And the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which I had the pleasure of serving on with my fellow subcommittee colleague, Congressman Mike Gallagher, who was the co-chair of the Solarium Commission, along with Senator Angus King. I also want to take a minute just to congratulate Mr. Gallagher and his wife on the birth of their new child, but also his leadership on the Solarium Commission. 
This has provided a strategic vision of layered sovereign deterrence, backed by recommendations to implement it. I'm incredibly proud of our leadership in taking the first steps to achieve Solarium's vision. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank again all the members of the subcommittee for their extraordinary work, and for the staff on putting this mark together. 
With that, I'll yield now to Ranking Member Stefanik or back to you, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Thank you. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities, the gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Stefanik, for any comments she would like to make. Ms. Stefanik, you're recognized for five minutes. 
STEFANIK: Thank you, Chairman Smith. I want to start by thanking my friend, IETC Chairman Jim Langevin, for his leadership, and all of the members of the subcommittee for their attendance and participation in our hearings and briefings. We've covered critical issues in this mark, including the department's contributions to the COVID-19 response, and we have done so in a collaborative and bipartisan manner. 
I would like to take a moment to highlight three broad themes that I believe are notable within the mark. First, this mark is active in all areas of the subcommittee's jurisdiction, with special emphasis on basic research and the important contributions that our science and technology ecosystem, including our universities, the DOD laboratories, and DARPA provide to our collective national defense, including our pandemic preparedness and response. 
There are important lessons learned that must be captured from the current COVID-19 crisis, and this mark begins that process by requiring the Government Accountability Office to review the department's biosurveillance and detection capabilities, and ability to respond to chemical or biological events in the future. 
This mark also restores a critical social science research program that has provided foundational insights into violent extremism, great power competition, and foreign information operations campaigns. 
Second, this mark strongly supports the department's investments in emerging technologies, and builds out the structure that will transform our research investments into military capability. This mark establishes a pilot program inside the Defense Innovation Unit that will modernize how the DOD identifies and employs our Reserve and National Guard servicemembers. 
It also includes a provision that elevates the Joint AI Center as a direct report to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and establishes a board of directors that will forge long-term partnerships with industry and subject matter experts. These provisions demonstrate how important artificial intelligence is and how urgently it must be integrated into not only our weapons systems but our healthcare systems, our predictive maintenance efforts, our humanitarian assistance missions, and our cybersecurity. 
Many of these provisions came from the AI Commission, which was part of a previous NDAA. Our ability to apply artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies faster than our adversaries will allow us to maintain our competitive edge over Russia and China. 
Mr. Chairman, I am also pleased that this mark will continue the tradition of rigorous oversight of ongoing and sensitive military operations, and the structures of our cyber and special operations forces. It includes requirements for the department to study the establishment of the cyber reserve force, and update policies to streamline the interoperability of our Reserve and National Guard forces when dealing with cyber incidents. 
This mark also requires the comptroller general to review how our elite special operations forces are pivoting to the challenge of great power competition, and reinvigorating our efforts in the contested information and cyber environments. 
And finally, as the proud representative of the soldiers and families of Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, my work on this subcommittee is important. It's integral to ensuring the safety and security of the men and women sent into harm's way. This subcommittee mark supports our force protection and military intelligence capabilities, to ensure our service members have the tools they need to mitigate hostile actions while they continue their important missions abroad. 
As the representative of the most deployed division in the United States Army who is currently serving in Afghanistan, my number one priority is force protection, and the safety and security of the brave men and women called into action to protect our national interests. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank our dedicated professional staff members of this subcommittee, and in particular Eric Snelgrove and Jason Schmid from our minority team, as well as Shannon Green and the entire majority team. Thank you as well to Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry for your leadership. This is a strong subcommittee mark, and I urge my colleagues to support. With that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Is there any further discussion on the subcommittee mark? Yes, Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to take a moment to highlight the work of this subcommittee and commend the chairman and the ranking member. We're not going to spend a lot of time debating cyber and artificial intelligence and biological preparedness, some of the most important things, not only for now but for the future of our military. 
And I just especially want to highlight as Chairman Langevin said, this subcommittee created an Artificial Intelligence Commission that is still working. But a number of its preliminary recommendations are now included. This subcommittee set up the Cyber Solarium panel on which Chairman Langevin and Mr. Gallagher sat, and a number of those recommendations are included. 
And I just think it's--there is such important work here that we won't spend much time debating, but it is literally the future of the nation. And I would just add a third thing, and that is biopreparedness. Chairman's mark puts money back into the biothreat program, which was exactly the right thing to do. This subcommittee has kept its eye on preparedness for biological threats. And I worry that COVID is educating our enemies on how they can come at us. And we are going to have to be even more prepared in the future. 
So lots of good work within the subcommittee, but also on these outside panels. And I just wanted to highlight that. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Thornberry. I just want to echo those comments. I think we both were chairs of this subcommittee once upon a time. And you're right, it's usually not something that we debate a lot in here, but there's incredibly important work that goes into that and, you know, the future of warfare, the technology that is involved. It's incredibly important stuff, even if we don't debate it and argue about it. So I want to second the ranking member's comments. 
It is now in order to consider en bloc package number one. The chair recognizes Mr. Langevin for the purposes of offering the en bloc amendment. 
LANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I begin, I want to thank both you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Thornberry for--for their comments. Since both you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Thornberry chaired or were ranking members on this subcommittee, I take that as high praise and hope that the both of you feel that you've left the subcommittee in good hands between myself and Ranking Member Stefanik and all our members. So I thank you for the comments. 
With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number one, consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. 
SMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? I know I've said this before, but that used to be such a more interesting moment. All kinds of people would fly up from the side; paper would be passed out. We'd run back and forth. Now we just sort of go, okay. Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. 
And Mr. Langevin is recognized for five minutes, and it may take him that long. This is a fairly long en bloc package. For the purposes of explaining the en bloc amendment, Mr. Langevin, you are recognized. 
LANGEVIN: I hope I don't have to ask unanimous consent for more time, Mr. Chairman. This is quite a list. With that, en bloc package number one is comprised of the following: Log 10r1 one by Representative Slotkin, Log 19 by Representative Gallagher, Log 57 by Representative Stefanik, Log 93 by Representative Gallagher, Log 137 by Representative Lamborn, Log 160r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 177r1 by Representative Brown, Log 187 by Representative Bacon, Log 203r1 by Representative Waltz, Log 204 by Rep Wittman, Log 300r1 by Representative Brindisi, Log 313r1 by Representative Wittman, Log 328r2 by Representative Langevin, Log 335 by Representative Langevin, Log 338 by Representative Larsen, Log 351r2 by Representative Waltz, Log 371 by Representative Waltz, Log 392r2 by Representative Houlahan, Log 393r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 394r1 by Representative Horn, Log 402r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 427r1 by Representative Speier, Log 440 by Representative Kim, Log 447r1 by Representative Carbajal, Log 458r2 by Representative Waltz, Log 465r1 by Representative Brindisi, Log 473r3 by Representative Sherrill, Log 479 by Representative Stefanik, Log 48--448-488r2 by Representative Torres Small, Log 504 by Representative Khanna, Log 506 by Rep Khanna, Log 530r1 by Representative Escobar, Log 564r3 by Representative Horn, Log 59-598r1 by Representative Trahan, Log 608 by Representative Conaway, Log 621 by Representative Conahan (SP), Log 45 by Representative Brown, Log 60--Log 68r1 by Representative Horn, Log 50 by Representative Brown, Log 55r1 by Representative Brown, Log 91 by Representative Turner, Log 199 by Representative Larsen, Log 540r1 by Representative Moulton, Log 158 by Representative Langevin, Log 225 by Representative Crow, Log 487r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 596r1 by Representative Speier, Log 198r2 by Representative Abraham, Log 374r2 by Representative Wilson, Log 418 by Representative Houlahan, Log 421 by Representative Houlahan, Log 433r1 by Representative Houlahan, Log 548 by Representative Hartzler. 
SMITH: I feel like we should offer another round of applause. 
LANGEVIN: (INAUDIBLE) 
SMITH: But that--that is completed. I--I do wanna make one--I will recognize myself to--to comment on the--the amendment process, just for people who are watching this and participating in this. There's a lot more that goes into that list that was just lead--read that it may appear. We had a little over 600 amendments submitted by members of the committee to this bill, and the members and the staff then work together with each other to work out the language, to try to find agreement where possible, so they're--it's not just the amendment submitted that's accepted and that's it. 
There's a lot of work that goes into that to--to getting the amendment to a place where it's the best policy and where we support it and that's--that's what is being recognized by the en bloc amendments that are being presented here, is a lot of work by a lot of people, even if at the end of it, it does come down to people simply reading the--the amendments, a lot of work went into it and those amendments are crucially important to our product. Is there further discussion on the en bloc package? 
LARSEN: Mr. Chairman-- 
SMITH: Mr. Larsen? 
LARSEN: Mr. Chairman I--I just wish to speak on Log (INAUDIBLE), it--it is true that for infrastructure we think of bridges, highways and transit but our infrastructure also includes 5G investment. Our leadership in 5G is important to national security and for our competitiveness. And this amendment is actually a Larsen-Gallagher amendment and would require the Secretary of Defense to identify and mitigate vulnerability in the military's telecommunications infrastructure and require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to submit a plan for the modernization of government's information technology systems. 
I do wanna enter into the record a statement from Congressman Mike Doyle, who's chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee and our Energy and Commerce Comun--Communications and Technology Subcommittee which is in support of the underlying amendment. There's a similar amendment from the ENC equivalent in the Senate in the NDAA, ours though also includes an addition, having to deal with a DOD infrastructure when we work with the ENC Committee on this, to make this happen. And so, I just wanna thank Congressman--Chairman Doyle and the bi--bipartisan group of folks on the Energy and Commerce Committee for making this happen and support this amendment. And also, I do wanna recognize again, Congressman Gallagher's support and work on this as well, since he can't be here with us today. So, with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Escobar, you're recognized for five minutes. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment supports creation of a national institute for space research as a university consortium. This will ensure the Space Force gets the same support from our research community as the established military services. Universities provide a critical service as partners in national security research. In my district, UTEP has significant expertise in aerospace and defense competencies, including long-standing partnerships with the military and advanced manufacturing and hypersonic technologies applications, and a clearance ready advanced student population. 
I have no doubt they will make great contributions to this effort. A strong presence in space is a national security imperative that is increasingly important for supporting communications and infrastructure of the DOD. My amendment ensures the committee stays abreast of the efforts to fully engage our university partners as we stand up our newest service. Thank you, I yield back. 
SMITH: Is there any further discussion on the amendment, Mr-- 
WALTZ: --Mr. Chairman?-- 
SMITH: --Waltz? 
WALTZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I--I wanna thank the subcommittee chairman and--and ranking member and just highlight for my colleagues, I have amendments in here that deal with our research and development enterprise and particularly the--the talents program and programs like that where the Chinese have as a matter of state policy frankly, been stealing our research and development now for quite some time. I wanna highlight this for my colleagues, we all have academic institutions, we all have research laboratories and we must as a committee, and as a country begin taking important steps to safeguard those investments for our national security, in particular this expands the--the requirements for professors to--of financial disclosures and then also better defines what these nefarious talent recruitment programs are for our academic research enterprise. 
So, I appreciate the committee's and--and particularly the committee staff support in getting this language to a good place. And then secondly, I also would like to thank them for their help with the Armed Overwatch, formerly known as the Light Attack program, as we shift as a country in our national defense strategy to deal with great power of competition we cannot lose sight of these special operators in remote locations all over the world. Today as we speak that need to close airs--that need in Armed Overwatch platform that is able to support them, that is sustainable and that is able to land in remote locations, and I thank you for the committee's support in these amendments. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Langevin is now recognized. 
LANGEVIN: Tha--thank you Mr. Chairman. So artificial intelligence is--is ushering into a--us into a new national security environment from tracking and targeting to command and control as we've developed our--our capabilities so do our adversaries and we can appreciate the--the comments that you made Mr. Chairman, along with--with Ranking Member Thornberry on this--on this topic. In the face of this new realty, I along with Ranking Member Stefanik championed the creation of a National Security Commission, on AI. And I just wanna pause for--for a moment just to particularly thank Ranking Member Stefanik, this has become an area of expertise for her and--and greatly appreciate her leadership and passion on the topic. We've been a great team on this issue and it's important to our national security. 
The--the commission was directed to comprehensively address the national security and defense needs of the United States and consider the methods and means necessary to advance the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and associated technologies. Today, we present two amendments that address many of the commission's recommendations to strengthen the (INAUDIBLE) AI workforce. The Department of Defense must attract, recruit and develop a workforce that is fluent in data science, software development, and programming. 
It must compete with the private sector to attract the best and the brightest and swiftly put them to work. To that end, my amendment creates unclassified working spaces, so the DOD can put individuals to work solving national security challenges, while they await nation--while they await security clearance. It will also upgrade hiring and selection practices by training human resources personnel in basic AI and pilot--and piloting an e-portfolio program to evaluate AI and develop our candidates. My amendment again in--in support with Ranking Member Stefanik, my amendment also incentivizes service members and civilian employees to pick up the mantle and tackle self-directing A--AI courses. 
As I said, AI will permeate through everyone's lives, we must open pathways for everyone to adopt these skills and apply them to their--to their careers. Finally, that this amendment that I'm speaking on now, came along with Ranking Member Stefanik, she and I worked on this together, establishes a DOD Steering Committee, to strategize we are to make investments in emerging technology. With that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for including these provisions into this en bloc package and I would also again like to thank Ranking Member Stefanik for her continued partnership and her leadership, and insight on AI and emerging technology. 
SMITH: Thank you very much. Is there further discussion on the en bloc package? Hearing none, the question is on the en bloc package offered by Mr. Langevin, so many as are in favor will say aye? 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. The ayes have it, the amendment is adopted. If there are no further amendments the chair recognizes the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin, for the purposes of offering a motion. 
LANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman, I move that the subcommittee mark now be--be adopted. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion of the gentleman from Rhode Island, so many as are in favor will say aye? 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed, no? Quorum being present the ayes have it and the motion is adopted. The committee now--will now receive the report on the Subcommittee on Readiness, pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all the recorded votes and the amendments of this particular subcommittee marked until consideration of all amendments of this subcommittee mark have concluded. The chair recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi for his opening comments. 
GARAMENDI: I thank you Chairman Smith, it's an honor to offer the Readiness Subcommittee portion of the mark for the full committee's consideration. I'd like to start by thanking Ranking Member Lamborn for his partnership on the subcommittee, the members of the subcommittee for their contributions and attention to the issues as well as the subcommittee's awesome staff both majority and minority for the many, many hours that they spent preparing this mark. The jurisdiction of the Readiness Subcommittee is wide-reaching ranging in topics from civilian personnel, sustainment, logistics, military construction, energy and environmental policy. With that in mind I would like to take just a few moments to provide some highlights of the key issues addressed in this mark. 
Following last year, the Readiness mark continues to address the vulnerabilities in installations and energy resiliency, both in response to climate change, as well as to ensure the department can continue to operate when fuel supplies and utilities are disrupted. Last year's NDAA made sweeping reforms in response to concerns raised by military families about the management, oversight and condition of military family housing. This subcommittee has remained deeply engaged in this issue and this mark made some additional necessary reforms. Similarly, we build on the previous efforts to address PFOS contamination around military installations and remain committed to working with the department, in an effort to find an alternative fire-fighting foam. 
The health and safety of our military and civilian personnel remains a priority of this subcommittee. Following a review of a number of fatal ground vehicle training mishaps, the subcommittee is concerned that the department's approach to collecting and reporting vehicle mishap data is not working, it's insufficient. The Readiness mark includes a reporting requirement that will help clarify the responsibilities for collecting and analyzing the mishap data, how that data is then being used to identify the trends and actions that the department is taking to standardize the collection and action to reduce mishaps. In addition to the concerns with ground vehicle mishaps, the committee has identified critical failures and safety issues in the munition's enterprises. 
A number of provisions in our mark address this important issue as well. Moving on to sustainment, while the Department of Defense talks a lot about modernization and development of new capabilities, we must ensure that focus always remains on the sustainment of these weapons systems. I believe that our mark does a good job at focusing and emphasizing this. I'd like also to take just a moment to highlight a few of the readiness provisions that are in the chairman's mark. First, with regard to civilian personnel, this mark supports the civilian workforce of the Department of Defense, by addressing a paid disparity affecting the department's wage, grade civilian workforce. This mark also makes technical corrections to include a non-Title-5--to include non-Title 5 employees who were left out of last year's Paid Parental Leave Provisions. 
Moving on to one of my personal top priorities which also tucks--touches on the Seapower Committee, this year's NDAA begins a unified whole of government approach that leverages the best attributes of government and commercial fleets to increase resiliency in our maritime logistics. The mark includes several provisions that together establish a national maritime logistic fleet approach by strengthening the U.S. flagged vessel requirements for the transportation of military cargo and fuels, creating a tanker security program and to address the shortfalls of U.S. flagged U.S. cruise tankers, and requiring the Navy to initiate an affordable domestic built sealift ship. Strengthening our maritime logistics will also enha--enhance our military's capabilities by improving the overarching defense industrial base that supports each branch of our armed services. I'm proud of the funding authorized by and the legislative provisions included in the Readiness mark and I again, thank Ranking Member Lamborn for his partnership and the members, all the members of this committee for their contributions. I urge my colleagues to support this mark and with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness, the gentleman from Colorado Mr. Lamborn for his comments. 
LAMBORN: Thank you, Chairman Smith. I would like to thank you and Ranking Member Thornberry for your leadership on this committee, and John Garamendi for his continued leadership and collaboration as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee. Today, we continue our work to markup H.R. 6395 the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The world is becoming increasingly dangerous and challenges to U.S. national security and economic interests continue to evolve. Competitors like China and Russia continue to challenge U.S. primacy in multiple domains. Our national must continue to invest in critical technology and future weapons platforms, but at the same time, we must support the readiness today of our men and women in uniform who are engaged in global operations. 
Whether they are defeating terrorist organizations, deterring adversaries or responding to aggression all of these missions rely on today's readiness. Members on both sides contributed to this mark. It reflects their hard work and dedication to our military and sincerely appreciate their hard work and leadership. I also wanna thank the staff for their diligence in supporting the initiatives of our subcommittee members and for their many hours of preparation. This mark focuses on several areas at the core of military readiness, especially as it pertains to logistics, sustainment, infrastructure and mission preparedness, and I am particularly proud of the following provisions: too often the military departments focus on procuring combat systems without fully meeting their obligations to project and sustain the joint force. 
This Readiness mark requires the Department of Defense to develop a sustainment and logistics strategy and to identify critical capability gaps. The Readiness mark also supports the number one and two unfunded priorities of the Commander of U.S. Transportation Command. It addresses shortfalls in aerial refueling capacity, due to issues with KC-46A fielding and planned tanker retirement. We also begin the process of recapitalizing our surge sealift fleet, which is vital to projecting the joint force in times of crisis and to executing war plans. Military installations do not exist in a vacuum, they rely heavily on local communities for infrastructure and to support their operations. 
The mark codifies the existing DOD Office Of Economic Adjustment which works with communities to manage the defense community infrastructure and Defense Access Roads Programs. It also makes investments to improve installation and energy resilience for critical infrastructure. It is also important that our military remains a good neighbor and respects the environment. This mark includes provisions to encourage responsible water use by military installations. It also improves accountability and transparency regarding DOD PFOS releases, and ensures that all National Guard Forces can access the Defense Environmental Restoration Account for PFOS cleanup. The safety of our service members is a paramount concern for this committee, and an area where we provide significant oversight. 
Our subcommittee continues to monitor and review training mishaps and to help prevent them. The Readiness mark requires DOD also to clarify responsibilities for collecting and analyzing ground and aviation mishap data to standardize data collection and to report on how that data is used to identify trends and to make changes. The mark continues the work this committee did last year to reform military family housing. It requires a report on environmental hazards and government owned housing, and it requires the Department of Defense to review the need to standardize performance metrics for privatized military housing. Our military families deserve safe homes. So, this mark reflects solid bipartisan work by the Readiness Subcommittee, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its adoption. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. 
SMITH: Alright, is there any discussion on the subcommittee's report? We will now consider En bloc package number 1. The chair recognizes Mr. Garamendi for the purposes of offering the en bloc amendment. 
GARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package Number 1 consisting of amendments that have been worked on and approved with--by the minority and the majority. 
SMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. And Mr. Garamendi is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of explaining the en bloc amendment. 
GARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I might need more than five minutes, considering the number of amendments, but let me begin. 
SMITH: I believe in you John, go ahead. 
GARAMENDI: I'll do my best. Log 27 Cook, Log 332r1 Mitchell, Log 37r1 Conaway, Log 48 Houlahan, Log 64 Stefanik, Log 80 Turner, Log 97r1 Garamendi, Log 103r1 Garamendi, Log 104r1 Garamendi, Log 105r1 Garamendi, Log 107r1 Garamendi, Log 108r1 Garamendi, Log 109r1 Garamendi, Log 119r1 Garamendi, Log 123r1 Garamendi, Log 157r2 Bacon, Log 163 Gallego, Log 169 Wilson, excuse me, 169r1 Wilson, Log 183r1 Davis, Log 189 Brown, Log 205r3 Mitchell, Log 209r1 Waltz, Log 212r1 Waltz, Log 223 Crow, Log 234r2 Houlahan, Log 248r1 Wilson, Log 250 Thornberry, 260 Speier, 264r2 Houlahan, 269r3 Bishop, 292 Speier, 296 Cisneros, 317 Graves, 327r2 Lamborn, 332r1 Larsen, 415 Garamendi, 437 Graves, 452r2 Luria, 483 (INAUDIBLE), 529r1 Conaway, 616 Trahan, 629r1 Garamendi, 538r1 Larsen, 4--546 Houlahan, 561 Bishop, 430r1 Langevin, 7--Log 72 Rep Stefanik, Log 77 Norcross, 1--Log 142r1 Brown, Log 41--Log 314 Crow, Log 446 Carbajal, Log 531, Log 240 Wittman, Log 158r2 Slotkin, Log 186r1 Houlahan, Log 188 Stefanik, Log 168 Houlahan, excuse me--Haaland, Log 16 Bacon, Log 517 Sherrill, and, Mr. Chairman, we took care of about one quarter of all of the amendments. With that, I complete. 
SMITH: Thank you. 
GARAMENDI: (INAUDIBLE) 
SMITH: Is there discussion on the en bloc package? 
LANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: I'm sorry, with my glasses on I cannot see that far. 
LANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Langevin and then--then we'll get to Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Langevin is recognized. 
LANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The--the amendment that I wanted to speak on that is offered is--is actually a bipartisan amendment with Representative Bacon along with Representative Crow. Climate change is a direct threat to the national security of the United States as this committee recognized in the 2018 NDAA. Although Congress and military experts identify climate change as a national security issue, the Department of Defense has failed to publish a comprehensive climate change strategy in nearly six years. The department must continue to plan for and integrate climate adaption and mitigation measures into all lines of effort to ensure the success of the mission. 
So, my amendment requires the department to update its climate change roadmap no later than February 1st, 2022. This roadmap will address a variety of climate stressor, such as geopolitical instability caused by droughts, increased demand for disaster relief and humanitarian aid, changes in our strategic calculus as the Arctic Ocean become more ice-free, and how we must notify personnel training amidst harsher temperatures and fiercer storms. So, the roadmap should present a united strategy for dealing with climate change going forward, and the other--and identify specific actionable steps to implement that strategy. Additionally, the roadmap must examine the direct and indirect costs climate change was have--will have on the department over the next five, 10 and 20 years and identify necessary climate security investments. Mr. Chairman, for decades, our military has accumulated climate debt, it's a balance sheet of missed opportunities to invest in resilience or to reduce emissions. 
Those bills are increasingly coming due. So, we need a comprehensive understanding of the costs the taxpayer is--is on the hook for, as our planet continue to warm, our sea levels continue to rise, and our ice caps continue to melt. By acting now, we can begin to stanch this drain on our operational effectiveness that have managed (SP) the national security impacts of climate change and avoid even more costly catch up measures down the road. So I thank you--thank again Mr. Bacon, and Mr. Crow, for their input on this--this amendment and--and with that, I wanna thank you for including this topic on the En bloc package and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell? 
MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. While I have a couple of amendments in this En bloc package, there's one I wish--just to speak with--about briefly. It's number--Log number 32, and it gets into the Air Force, their analysis of community support, trending capabilities range and air space available for the location of strategic aircraft. As you're all here well aware, we put a great deal of money into our strategic aircraft, the most recent being F-35s and the basing of those have become a significant concern. I saw that recently with the F-35 Ops 5 and 6 basing decisions where despite ongoing and significant concerns from the community as well as regarding air space, the Air Force decided to move forward with a preferred--with their preferred alternative, rather than salvage Air National Guard Base. Despite direct access to the largest range East of Mississippi, the Air Force moved forward with a base at another location that the community has significant concerns about. 
To address--additionally in a CODEL that Mr. Carbajal and I participated among others, Mr. Bacon, we also saw another base that has significant concerns about training capabilities and had to actually come back to the United States to have training range necessary for the F-35s. We're making significant investment in this aircraft, it's helpful if it actually can have our airmen and women participate in training regularly, to keep them fully proficient. To address these deficiencies, my amendment simply requires the Air Force to actually analyze community comments in support of and opposition to their basing action and justify why they choose a site with less community support than others, review the joint all-domain training capability separate from their mission criteria. 
You can't complete the mission if we don't actually train for it, compare training aerospace availability separate from and in addition to the bare minimum requirements described by the mission criteria; do they have the best range possible? And finally, it (INAUDIBLE) reporting requirement to us, the committee, when preferred and reasonable alternative are announced. This then will help improve this committee's oversight of strategic basing, significant investment for the future and further insulate it from subjective criteria that compromise in my opinion, and the opinion of others I believe the objective decisions--objectivity of those decisions. With that I yield back, thank you Mr. Chair. 
SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Horn is recognized. 
HORN: Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I want to express my gratitude to Chairman Garamendi, Ranking Member Lamborn and all of the--the committee members on--on the subcommittee for the important work on--on military housing that we--that we accomplished both last year, and in this year's bill and speak briefly to Mi--Military Homes Act which is contained in my amendment, in 69 and thank Representatives Kim, Turner and Waltz for their work on this effort with me. 
This is an additional--this--this amendment provides additional protections for our military service members and their families, including hazard mitigation protection, transparency and performance fee contracts, (INAUDIBLE) mitigation working group that would help our service generals to provide guidance on mitigation standards and an IG Report on the expansion of basic housing standards for--for our military families, as well as an exceptional military family--family member program and facility housing liaison, and a GAO Report following up on the implementation of these important reforms that we have put into place. Because we know that readiness includes the critical care of our--our military service members as well as their families, and that every single one deserves safe and secure housing. And I am grateful for the opportunity to do this important work and look forward to the continued efforts and--and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Crow is recognized. 
CROW: Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I wanna recognize the leadership and hard work of Chairman Garamendi and Ranking Member Lamborn for this important effort. And also dovetail off of the--the comments by Ranking Member Lamborn and Mr. Langevin as well. One of the important things that this mark does is it recognizes the changing nature of warfare in the modern battlefield, in that our installations themselves should eb viewed as major weapons systems. As we address the--the changing nature of warfare and the evolution of the battlefield, we have to recognize that every electrical outlet, every installation is in and of--of itself critical to our national defense, from threats of climate change, to extreme weather, to water scarcity, to cyber threats, we have to address this threat, and this mark goes a long way to get us on the path to doing that. From the provisions that address water scarcity in the west, to those that require planning around climate change, to those that bolster the electrical grid and the infrastructure at our facilities, this mark is an important one, and I'm very proud to be working across the aisle with the members to make sure that we are preparing our installations to meet the needs of the 21st century. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Gallego, do you seek recognition? 
GALLEGO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you again to Mr. Garamendi also. Camp Navajo is a former military installation in Northern Arizona, it's pretty unused, mostly as a result of policies on land use in that area. This amendment will allow for greater use of the land and facilities there to the benefit of the local population. Everyone agrees with this amendment, the Army, the Navy, the local community, everyone. We even checked with the Committee on Oversight to get their take, even though we didn't need to, and they're good with it as well. So, I wanna thank the readiness staff and the committee staff as a whole for their work and urge a yes vote. I yield back. 
SMITH: Is there any further discussion on the amendment? 
UNKNOWN: Mr. Kelly's (INAUDIBLE), sir. 
SMITH: Mr. Kelly are you--do you--no. Just curious, what's going on back here? 
UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) 
SMITH: Thank you. If not, the question's on the adoption of the en bloc package offered by Mr. Garamendi, so many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed will say no. The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. Before moving on to the next amendment, I do wanna remind the folks participating remotely by video, you do need to--to keep your video on at all times while--while you're participating, thank you. It is now--let me find the right place, here. We will now consider Log 613, an amendment offered by Mr. Gaetz. For what purpose does Mr. Gaetz seek recognition? 
GAETZ: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the court please distribute the amendment? Without objection we will dispense with the reading of the amendment, and the chair recognizes Mr. Gaetz, for the purposes of explaining his or her amendment. 
GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I joined the committee in the 115th Congress when our service branches were dealing with the devasting consequences of sequestration and specifically the readiness consequences. As a bipartisan team, we pulled out of that, but it did create a number of downward pressures on military construction requests from--throughout our enterprise and from a number of our committee members. Now we find ourselves in a circumstance where repair dollars are un--are constrained to restoration even when replacement would be more financially viable and would be more cost effective. So, all my amendment does is give the service secretaries the authority if they so choose, to replace structures at a lower cost rather than repairing them at a higher cost. This is particularly poignant in circumstances where there are expensive environmental concerns, asbestos removal in--in our physical plant that we're seeking to improve. So, this would only allow the replacement instead of repair in the circumstance where the service secretary deemed it was cost effective and I would urge adoption of the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Garamendi? 
GARAMENDI: I--I fully understand what Mr. Gaetz is attempting to do here, but the result of it is to basically remove the authority of this committee in the construction of facilities, of new facilities. Basically, it would remove the over--the authority of our committees to authorize and appropriate military construction projects. The O&M accounts are rather large, they can be used for a variety of purposes, and they can be under this amendment, used for the construction of new facilities. I understand what Mr. Gaetz wants to do but we review constantly, literally the entire year, construction activities on bases, and we set out in the military construction portion of our mark the authorization for new buildings, new facilities and the like. This amendment would basically remove that authority. 
Those of us that have been here but for a year or two have recognized that the Congress has largely abdicated its appropriation responsibilities. And with earmarks no longer being a part of our life, we now have what are known as administrative earmarks and that's a problem. So here we are, in a well-intended amendment, really giving up a very, very important power that we have. And I suspect that at some point one or another of our 435 members will come to us and say, ""What is the world are they doing at X, Y, Z facility with that new hanger?"" And we'll go ""We don't know anything about that, it's never been authorized."" So, I would suggest that Mr. Gaetz's amendment well-intended as it is, really is not appropriate both for us as well as for the Appropriations Committee, and I would oppose it. 
SMITH: Thank you. I will speak on this amendment for a moment and I--I too oppose it. I understand what is trying to be accomplished here, but first of all there is a capped amount of flexibility for DOD to--to make these types of changes. They--they can do it, what this amendment does is lifts that cap and essentially the impact of it would be that you could--well first of all the--the readiness issue, I mean this is money that would be taken--being taken out of O&M, taken out of what is--O&M is basically readiness, for military construction purposes and the department would have the unfettered discretion to do that. And that take us out of the process, takes the oversight out of the process, and I think also--you know put--puts at risk the MILCON or it puts at risk our ability to have any say in what goes on in that MILCAN--CON account. So, I too oppose this amendment and I would urge the committee to oppose it as well. Is there further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Bacon? 
BACON: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield to Matt Gaetz. 
GAETZ: I thank the gentleman for yielding. I--I can't expect that our Article 1 powers would require the Congress to become the construction board for every installation and every case particularly in circumstances where you have to have the service secretary designate that replacement would be more cost effective than repair. 
So it would--it would seem that we would be merely resting on our laurels to say that to preserve an Article 1 power we would require repairs to entities that are more expensive and less cost effective than replacement. It seems fundamentally counterintuitive; I understand there's a--there's a cap in that flexibility now. I'm hopeful that during the conference process perhaps we might find a way to raise that cap to be accommodating to my concerns, so as to not do things that are financially cost effective. And so, with that hope, I'll withdraw the amendment this time. 
SMITH: Thank you, the--the amendment is withdrawn. We will now consider Log number 623, for what purposes does the gentleman from Texas seek recognition? 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. The chair recognizes Mr. Thornberry, for the purposes of explaining his amendment. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'll bet every single member of this committee has fussed at one time or another about DOD spending tons of money at--before the end of the fiscal year so--before they lose it. That use it or lose it problem. It--operations and maintenance money is one-year money. So, if it's not spent by September 30th, they lose it. And--and so what is natural for human beings to do? It's to spend everything they can think of in September or else they don't--it's--it's gone. 
And--and so, without maybe the deliberation and--and consideration that it deserves. O&M is--is I think the biggest part of the defense budget. And if you look at the percentage of O&M money that is spent in September it's an enormous share. So, what am I trying to do? I'm trying to say, ""Okay, 50 percent of what you don't spend, you can hold over to another year."" Now by the way, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Treasury, The Department of Transportation, The Department of Housing and Urban Development have that authority, with the 100-plus agencies that are under them. 
So, you don't get to spend it all, but you can spend half of it, in another year so that you reduce the pressure to use it or lose it. Unfortunately, this amendment has been referred to Appropriations Committee that will not waive. So, I'm--I'm not gonna be able to--to pursue it in the committee. I may well try to pursue it on the floor. But--but I just wanna take a moment to highlight to everybody we can fuss and complain all we want about DOD not spending money efficiently but here the problem is us. And as a Congress, we can fix it, if we just will. And--and we cannot let territorial parochialism prevent a fix that is working in other departments and that would make such a difference. 
By the way I have a--a companion measure that says, ""If DOD has some money that they can't spend, then they can come to us and put it into ship building or facility sustainment."" The problem is now if they say, ""We're--we're never gonna spend this money,"" then it goes back to the treasury, they lose it so they just leave it sitting there year after year, after year. Again, we're part of the problem, we're not giving them an out. These are both things that DOD has requested, but it gets in the jur--into committee jurisdictional issues. Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I can't proceed at this point, but I hope that as a Congress we can deal with these issues and I--and I withdraw the amendment at this point. 
SMITH: Hey, I have an enormous amount of sympathy for what--what the gentlemen had to say and I would look forward to working with you, 'cause I do think that's a significant problem and it--it absolutely happens, it is not just a--you know, an old folk tale that--sorry, it's complicated between the glasses and the mask here. So, I think it's really important that we consider this. People absolutely spend money because they know they'll get less next year if they don't. But the gentlemen has withdrawn the amendment, so I'm sorry, Mr. Cook, the amendment has been withdrawn, but did you wish to speak on anything else? 
COOK: Yes, sir I--I think everyone who in this room has been a military commander is--is guilty of this, we've all done it, and you say to yourself, ""Well, maybe it's cynicism, somebody else is gonna misspend the money, let's go ahead and do it."" It's actually criminal the more-the--when I think about it, I'll probably burn in hell for--for doing this repeatedly and it shouldn't--and--and general, stop laughing over there, you probably did the same thing too. But there's certain things that it's too bad we couldn't capture from--I'm leaving here. There's a lot of people here and it--this is as I said, something that we've gotta correct, it's been around since--God, I've retired from the Marine Corps in 1992, let's see. Some of you weren't born then probably but it--it's been going on, it's never been fixed and maybe we ought to get a tape of this and send it over to the Appropriations Committee and say, ""Do something about it, this is criminal and it's wrong."" So, I obviously support it, I just hope we don't forget about it. 
SMITH: Thank you, if--if I had the power Mr. Cook, I would absolve you, but I do not unfortunately. The amendment has been withdrawn, but I will--Mr. Moulton I believe has a comment, so I will recognize Mr. Moulton. 
MOULTON: Thank you Mr. Chairman, just very briefly as someone who is on the other side of the aisle, but also a Marine veteran though I wasn't yet in high school in 1992, I-- 
COOK: --You were born however, so there-- 
MOULTON:
 --I just wanna offer y support for Mr. Thornberry's amendment as well. 
COOK: No mea culpa? 
SMITH: Thank you. We'll try to work on something on the floor and work with the Appropriations Committee on that process. If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi for the purposes of a motion. 
GARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I move the mark. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion of the gentleman from California, so many as in favor will say aye? 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
GARAMENDI: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed, no. Quorum being present, the ayes have it and the motion is adopted. The committee will now receive the report of the Subcommittee On Military Personnel pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all the recorded votes and the amendments to this particular subcommittee mark until consideration of all amendments of this subcommittee mark has concluded. And the chair recognizes the chairwoman of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from California Ms. Speier, for her opening remarks. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the Military Personnel Subcommittee mark was adopted unanimously last week, reflecting the bipartisan nature of this effort and is inclusive of many member's priorities. I wanna thank Ranking Member Kelly for his leadership and support this year. The provisions included in this mark and military personnel provisions found in the full committee mark will continue to improve the lives of military service members and their families. 
The subcommittee's priority has always been to take care of service members and their families, and this year's mark raises military basic pay by 3 percent as well as authorizing the Secretary of Defense to pay a basic needs monthly allowance for low-income service members who meet criteria based on Federal Poverty Guidelines for gross annual pay, not including basic housing allowance. The full committee mark authorizes $40 million dollars to provide assistance to local educational agencies with military dependent students, and $10 million to assist with students with severe disabilities. 
It also reverses cuts by the department by funding the Stars and Stripes and requires a business case analysis to maintain the Stars and Stripes as an information benefit to service members, especially those deployed. The chairman's mark also requires a feasibility study on allowing military spouses to contribute to the Military Thrift Savings Plan of the military member. The mark also includes much needed improvements to the Exceptional Family Members Program by requiring the Secretary Of Defense to standardize the program across all service by establishing a process to identify and enroll dependents, improve seamless moves to new installations, maintaining the continuity of service, and a more robust review process to ensure healthcare is available in the MTF and TRICARE. This provision requires a single EFMP Office at the service headquarters as well as at each installation to coordinate services for those enrolled. Most importantly it requires the services to hire a dedicated EFMP attorney who specializes in education law, at each installation to advocate for children's education plans. 
The subcommittee continues to provide authorities to improve the department's childcare program by requiring childcare services on a 24-hour basis on installations where there is shift work. The mark also requires the Secretary of Defense to implement a communication strategy to better communicate with family members. This is extremely important to understand family issues and so it includes a requirement for a biannual survey to measure the effectiveness of the department's program for childcare education, spouse employment, financial stress and healthcare issues. The mark establishes a domestic violence taskforce with experts inside and outside of government to help formulate improve policy, and prevention efforts to reduce incidents of this heinous crime. 
The taskforce will collect the prevalence of domestic violence in the military and implement strategies that target prevention resources to address those with a higher risk of domestic violence and get to the left of the problem. I'm pleased the mark includes a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations for a Safe to Report Program which will reduce the fear victims have of reporting sexual assault. The mark also includes a requirement for a tracking mechanism and reporting requirements for supremacists, extremists and criminal gang activity in the armed forces as well as--as racist anti-Semitic, or supremacist in the workplace surveys to understand the magnitude of this issue. This is an area that is increasingly becoming problematic. 
The mark begins to address diversity in the military by requiring each secretary of the military department to submit annually a report summarizing gender and race of each officer who is recommended on a list for promotion to the United States Senate for the grades of 04 and above. The chairman's mark also provides to block PPI in promotion board reviews. This is only the beginning and we will continue to improve on this as we move through the committee process. The subcommittee continues to provide oversight over the military health system reform by prohibiting the realignment or reduction of authorized military medical and strength for one year, requiring more analysis that includes the military health system's role for homeland pandemic response, the mark also delays the implementation of moving retirees and family members out of military treatment facilities until one year after implementation plan is submitted to Congress. 
It also requires a report to higher retain behavioral health as well as expand the use of telehealth and include behavioral health treatment as part of overall service member readiness. The subcommittee mark continues over its oversight of the Space Force by requiring detailed report on the force-structure plan that includes milestones that highlight force-structure actions to be completed, resource allocation and personnel transfer. Finally, in response to COVID's pandemic that continues to impact our military with rising numbers of positives, the subcommittee mark includes several provisions to ensure the department is postured and prepared for future pandemics with the appropriate diagnostic testing capability, protective equipment and research capability on hand, as well as requiring the National Security Strategy to include provisions of drug vaccine and critical medical equipment to ensure combat readiness of our military. 
The mark also requires a pilot program working with our federal agencies, to enhance the surge capacity to assist citizens of our nation if required. Let me end by saying what I say at every base, that I have visited, ""When the service members serves, so does his or her family. Together they make sacrifices for our nation we will never totally understand, and we must continue our commitment to them."" 
Lastly, I wanna acknowledge the subcommittee's efforts: Craig Greene, Dave Cocheti (SP) our newest members of the team, Hannah Coffman, Jamie Jackson, Glen Deo, Paul Golden, and Daniel Stites (SP) all of whom worked in a bipartisan manner to develop the mark this year, with the added challenge of building it remotely and with over 141 amendments that were submitted to this subcommittee. I also would like to thank my personal staff, Josh Connelly, Brian Colins and fellows, Luke Cusenga (SP) and Tom Poopey (SP). 
SMITH: Thank you, the chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, the gentleman from Missi--Mississippi, Mr. Kelly, for his comments. 
KELLY: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I thank the Chairwoman Speier, and my fellow subcommittee members for yet again showing their professionalism and dedication to bipartisan through a unanimous adoption of the Military Personnel Subcommittee mark last week. This year's markup process led to some outstanding legislative outcomes that included many of the priorities of our members. 
There were some challenges this year, mainly COVID-19 but we came together and have embraced new norms to ensure the mark includes the vital provisions that support our war fighters, military families and retirees and gives them the care and support they need, deserve and have earned. 
This year's subcommittee mark continues to rebuild and grow the armed forces including increases in (INAUDIBLE) and the Army, Navy and for the first time the Space Force and there's also a requirement for a detailed report on the force-structure plan of the Space Force. This proposal also includes an extension of special pay and bonuses for service members in high-demand fields and supports a military basic pay raise of 3 percent. The mark continues the committee's dedicated work in support of military families. 
The full committee mark authorizes $40 million to provide assistance to local education agencies with military dependent students and another $10 million to assist students with severe disabilities. The full committee mark also includes a study that would require the Department of Defense to examine the feasibility of authorizing a spouse to contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan account of their service member spouse. If feasible this may prove to be very helpful to many military families. 
The mark requires the Department Of Defense to redefine military family readiness and military family resiliency, as well as implement a strategy to better communicate with military families and develop a bi-annual survey that measures the effectiveness of the department's program in areas like education, spousal employment and military healthcare. The mark requires a standardization of the Exceptional Family Member Program EFMP, to include the process for identifying and enrolling participants, enhances the Respite Care Benefit, establishes outcomes measures that improve the screening process for the evaluation of duty stations that can support EFMP enrollees. The mark requires the department to determine the behavioral health needs of service members and all other TRICARE beneficiaries and develop a strategy to meet any unmet demand. It also requires an action plan on the use of telehealth for behavioral healthcare and other similar medical disciplines. 
The mark requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a military civilian taskforce on domestic violence with experts from within the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department Health and Human Services, And Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as civilian experts. It also requires the department to collect information on the prevalence of domestic violence involving members of the armed forces, their intimate partners and immediate family members. The mark continues to build on critical reforms in previous NDAAs including refining sexual assault prevention and response programs, providing additional oversight of the military health system to include prohibiting further realignment of military medical in strength until a review of medical manpower requirements--includes homeland defense missions and pandemic influenza. 
Finally, the mark includes several provisions include--addressing COVID-19 pandemic that has gripped virtually all parts of the military and society. It requires the department to ensure that the armed forces have the diagnostic equipment, testing capabilities and personnel--personal protective equipment necessary to protect service members from the threat of infectious disease and to treat member who contact infectious disease. It also requires national security strategy (INAUDIBLE) provisions of drugs, biologics, vaccines and other critical medical equipment to ensure combat readiness and the safeguarding of health out of the armed services. In conclusion, I wanna thank Chairwoman Speier and my colleagues on the subcommittee for their considerable work on this mark. 
I also wanna thank our staff on the minority, Glen Dale (SP), and Paul Golden (SP), and on the majority, Craig Greene, Dave Giachi (SP), Hannah Coffman (SP) and Daniel Steeds (SP), who work in a bipartisan manner to support all members of the Military Personnel Sub--Subcommittee. I also want to thank my personal staff who worked diligently during this process. Mississippi National Guard captain Charles Woods who is now the chief of staff of the state officer in Mississippi who did immense work, Mississippi National Guard major Rodney Hall who works in my office in my MLA, and also my army fellow, Sergeant Major Jeremy Bartnett. I couldn't have done it without their help and input. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Kelly. Is there further discussion of the subcommittee report? Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to take just a second to highlight the work of this subcommittee when it comes to family readiness and resilience. The--the chair and ranking member have had some excellent hearings that have really dug down into some family issues and based in part on what they have discovered and what we've heard from family members, Mr. Kelly and I introduced a standalone bill on family readiness back in April and--and the chair was good enough to include it in her mark. 
And--and I can't do it say it better than--then Chairwoman Speier did. Families serve too and I think the provisions in this bill do as much for families as any we've had in--in quite some time. Now, we don't solve all the problems and I suspect all of us have heard about the backups in not being able to move and having multiple families have to live in the same house and all of these things that are happening. We don't solve everything, but there is a lot of good here and I just want to express my appreciation to the chair and then ranking member for--for this emphasis on family readiness and resilience. 
SMITH: Thank you. Ms. Luria. 
LURIA: Thank you, Mr. Chair for yielding. And I want to thank Chairwoman Speier and Ranking Member Kelly for your excellent work on this subcommittee mark. As the representative of a district where one in five residents touches the military, their active duty military, a veteran, or a family member there of military members and their families and veterans are among my top priorities and that's why I'm pleased that the military personnel mark implements policies that will benefit these members and families who serve our nation. 
Within this mark, I support the protections for families living in military housing and I'm also reassured carries language to further delay the reduction in the capacity of defense health agency providers. I'd also like to thank the chair for including the text of my bill, the Military Pilot Cancer Incident Study, H.R. 5858. I've heard many anecdotes of elevated cancer incidence amongst military pilots and it is alarming. 
I introduced this bill so that we don't have to rely on anecdotal data anymore. And on Veterans Affairs, as the chair of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, I know that the collection of this data will be incredibly important in determining, you know, if there is a link between this military service and the cancer that has been observed. 
So, I appreciate the inclusion of that in this bill and I greatly appreciate the support of the chair and ranking member on including that. And I strongly encourage my colleagues to--to support the military personnel mark as part of the NDAA. 
SMITH: Thank you. Is there further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Trahan? 
TRAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for including my legislation in the Comprehensive Review of Military Suicide Act as a--en bloc amendment. Our service members are dying by suicide at increasingly higher rates each year. It's abundantly clear that more needs to be done to prevent our men and women in uniform who sacrificed so much for our country from reaching a point of such despair that they are compelled to end their life. 
It is imperative the military leaders develop a complete picture surrounding these tragic events. That is why I introduced this bill which requires the Secretary of Defense through the undersecretary for personnel and readiness to publish guidance on the establishment of a multi-disciplinary board to conduct a comprehensive review of all suicide-related incidents. 
This multi-disciplinary board will have cross sectional representation and authority to create a more holistic understanding of why a service member committed suicide, which would then be reported in the DOD suicide event report. The bill would be made up--the board would be made up of unit leadership, supporting medical and mental health professionals, installation law enforcement personnel and community support personnel who each provide a unique perspective that adds to the completeness of each incident report. 
The department's own inspector general recommended that this board be implemented years ago. The implementation of this approach will go a long way in improving the quality and completeness of data collected in the DOD suicide event reports submission. Although much more needs to be done to combat the root causes of this tragic trend, the creation of a multi-disciplinary board is a step towards designing meaningful policy prescriptions to protect our men and women in uniform. I'd like to thank Chairwoman Speier, Ranking Member Kelly, and certainly Representative Cisneros for joining me in this effort. Thank you and I yield back. 
SMITH: Is there further discussion of the subcommittee mark? Hearing none, we will now consider en bloc package number one. The chair recognizes Ms. Speier for the purposes of offering the en bloc amendment. 
SPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number one consisting of amendments that have been worked on and approved with the minority. 
SMITH: Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? Without objection, the amendments are considered as read and the gentlewoman is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of explaining the en bloc amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. En bloc package number one is comprised of the following. Log 35 by Representative Davis, Log 4--47r3 by Representative Horn, Log 52r1 by Representative Brown, Log 74 by Representative Norcross, Log 76 by Representative Brown, Log 85 by Representative Turner, Log 98r1 by Representative Turner, Log 122 by Representative Luria, Log 133 by Representative Turner, Log 154 by Representative Lane--Langevin, Log 159r1 by Representative Bacon, Log 167 by Representative Bacon, Log 173 by Representative Waltz, Log 178r1 by Representative Brown, Log 253r1 by Representative Haaland, Log 290 by Representative Speier, Log 302r1 by Representative Hartzler, Log 341 by Representative Banks, Log 375 by Rep Langevin, Log 422 by Rep--Representative Brown, Log 448r2 by Representative Luria, Log 471r1 by Representative Brown, Log 472r1 by Representative Brown, Log 480 by Representative Moulton, Log 500 by Representative Trahan, Log 526 by Representative Bergman, Log 551r3 by Representative Gabbard, Log 553r1 by Representative Desjarlais, Log 555 by Representative Kelly, Log 610 by Representative Speier, Log 611 by Representative Waltz, Log 79 by Representative Turner, Log 84 by Representative Turner, Log 95 by Representative Turner, Log 221r1 by Representative Speier, Log 258r2 by Representative Haaland, Log 287r1 by Representative Speier, Log 2--297 by Representative Cisneros, Log 532r1 by Representative Speier, Log 34 by Representative Davis, Log 78--78r1 by Representative Brown, Log 134 by Representative Turner, Log 164 by Representative Brooks, Log 231r by Representative Wittman, and Log 376 by Representative Houlahan. 
SMITH: Thank you very much. I was thinking we should hire an auctioneer to get to get through those. That would be cool to listen to. Is there discussion on the en bloc package? Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: I thank the chairman for yielding. I wanted to talk about Log 555, that prohibition on changing--charging for accounting against certain acronyms on headstones of individuals interned at Arlington. I offer this amendment to give the families of our great service members who have paid the ultimate sacrifice the ability to have KIA, MIA, and POW, killed in action, missing in action, or--or prisoner of war placed on the headstones in Arlington without those three letters counting against the total character count or at line count. 
This amendment will also keep those three characters from being part of the charge when factoring pricing of engraving for the surviving families. I look forward to working with the VA committee and expanding this opportunity to go to all military cemeteries across United States. I thank you for your support and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Before moving on, I do want to make one note. It occurs to me that unlike in normal years--well, long story short, it's going to be tough for us to eat lunch without taking a break. Let's just get--get that point. So, we are going to take a half hour break. My intention would be, gosh, let's say 12:45, is that okay? 
We'll break from 12:45 to 1:15. Votes may be starting at that point, but we can navigate through it. So, it would be my intention to take a half hour break for lunch from 12:45 to 1:15. Members have concerns with that or have a different idea, please talk to the staff and let us know. Mr. Scott. No, no, sorry. Anybody else wish to speak on the en bloc? Raise your hand if you do. Yes, Ms. Horne. 
HORN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak on Log 47r3. This amendment, my amendment creates a fallen soldier's database, which will serve as a record in remembrance of the brave and immeasurable sacrifice that so many have made for our nation. Currently, online records and military casual--casualties are scattered amongst numerous web sites and platforms and the DOD should step in to create an accurate historical record and centralized location for that information. 
My amendment would create a publicly available database that would list every casualty where--and where it would occur. It would also list names, ranks, service branch, and the home city of record of each fallen soldier. We are doing a disservice I believe to soldiers in our history by forgetting each individual when considering the costs of--of their service. And this database would make sure that their sacrifice is never forgotten. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
SMITH: Further discussion on the en bloc package? Hearing none, the question is on adoption of the en bloc package offered by Ms. Speier. So many as are favorable say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed, no. The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. Now--we will now consider Log 323. For what purposes--for what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? 
GARAMENDI: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Would the court clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. The chair recognizes Mr. Garamendi for the purposes of explaining his amendment. 
GARAMENDI: I'll try to be very brief with this. Our former colleague Walter Jones was working on this when he died rather unexpectedly and I took over this task from him. Basically, what happens for military retirees, the benefit terminates on the day of death. That may occur in the first day of the month, or it may occur in the last day of the month, but if the surviving spouse does not notify the department immediately, the payment is made. 
The department then, unbeknownst to the surviving spouse without authority goes into the bank account and retrieves the money. Leaving the surviving spouse with an empty bank account in many cases. And so, what we tried to do with this--what Walter Jones was trying to do is to provide an opportunity for that month's payment to continue to be paid to the surviving spouse. That may have been a full month, or it may have been just the last day of the month. In either case, their surviving spouse would have that in the bank account and would not be subject to the money being taken out of the account without the knowledge of the surviving spouse. 
Unfortunately, CBO dumped on this one--jumped on it and dumped on it and said, ""oh my God, it's going to cost 25 to $50 million over the next decade. Oh my."" And therefore, we have a CBO estimate that makes it impossible for me to proceed. 
I have no idea why CBO is doing this to us or to the surviving spouse, but I am told by staff tough luck, surviving spouse. Tough luck, Walter Jones. And I suppose I'm going to have to withdraw the amendment unless something happens here. Well-- 
SMITH: --Thank you. The amendment is withdrawn, and it is now in order to consider tab number 368. For what purposes does the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania seek recognition? 
HOULAHAN: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? 
HOULAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Sorry. Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the gentlewoman is recognized to explain her amendment. 
HOULAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I came to Congress, this committee authorized a National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service. The commission delivered its report to Congress this March. My colleagues and me in the For Country Caucus introduced the commission's recommendation as a package, the Inspire to Serve Act led by my friend and former member of this committee, Representative Jimmy Panetta. 
Representatives Waltz and Bacon and I believe strongly that this committee needs to seriously consider the merits of these recommendations, which is why we are offering this amendment. These recommendations range across all of government and the national security apparatus from cyber security to benefits. I'm very excited about several provisions, including a cyber readiness provision to leverage a civilian cyber security reserve, which would permit agencies to quickly expand that federal civilian workforce with technical skills, unique platform knowledge, and appropriate clearances necessary to address cybersecurity needs in our nation. 
Cyber talent is something that I'm incredibly concerned about and this is an issue I've been working to address through my seat here on HASC. So, it's great to see ideas like these represented in this report. The commission has also recommended that all Americans be required to register for the Selective Service. Women can and do contribute to our armed forces just as much as their male counterparts. That includes as engineers, as I was, as doctors and lawyers, as cyber warriors, and yes, in combat. 
Though we are being reminded through this pandemic how important service is, we recognize that the Armed Services Committee is not ready to act on these recommendations at this time and that there are many other committees of jurisdiction involved. I understand that moving forward with this amendment now would trigger referrals to multiple committees, but we hope this committee can commit to seriously considering these recommendations in the coming months, especially in the inclusion of women in this selective service. I cede the remainder of my time to Representative Waltz and Bacon to share their support. 
WALTZ: Thank--thank you, Representative Houlahan, I--I certainly want to second my support for these recommendations. I've looked--very much enjoyed working with you and others in the For Country Caucus and I just want to emphasize to my colleagues whether it's military combat national, public service, I think one of the often overlooked aspects, particularly in these times that the country is going through now is that, you know, with her you're building a home for Habitat for Humanity, whether you're fighting in a foxhole, you do it with people that don't look like you, that don't come from the same background, and you learn to share those experiences. You learn leadership, followership, discipline, teamwork, and certainly no one cares about political party. 
And so, I think as--as we move forward as a committee, I look forward to working through some of these issues, to having the appropriate hearings. I--I can't think of anything more important that this committee could do working with our colleagues. But to understand one another and to move this country back towards a sense of service, towards a sense of mission, and--and towards a sense of--of patriotism and for a higher cause then for ourselves. I yield my time too Representative Bacon. 
BACON: Thank you, Mr. Waltz. Thanks, Ms. Houlahan, for bringing this forward. I just--my comments will be real brief. This is an opportunity to have one of the most transformative things that we can do in the next decade or two--two decades, it could be some of the changes in our country, in a positive way for decades to come. 
And so, I look forward to being a part of this discussion this year and next year to hopefully make this a reality. But national public service has a chance to make a long impact for decades to come in this country unifying impact bringing our country together and I think it's needed more than ever. So, with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Ms. Davis. 
DAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to echo my colleagues on this issue and honestly say of all the things that haven't happened while I've been here in these last 20 years, this is one area that I feel badly about. I had an opportunity to testify before the commission as well as work with them, as many of you have. And I do think particularly at this time when we need people to walk in one another's shoes, this is a very important idea that we've had in this country for years, but we've not been able to implement it at a scale that really impacts young men and women throughout our country. And I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Ms. Speier. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too would like to associate myself with the intent of this amendment, and if you recall, there was an amendment offered in the NDAA a couple of years ago by then-congressman Duncan Hunter. And it passed and I spoke heartily in favor of it and it got to the Rules Committee before it was taken up on the floor and they twisted themselves into some kind of a pretzel to take it out of the NDAA. 
So, Ms. Houlahan, you have my commitment that we will have a hearing on this issue in that next year because I, presuming we are all here, and I think that the time has come. I've always been a believer that we won't have true equality in this country until women Have a seat at the table and also contribute to national service. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to take a second and remind everybody it was kind of controversial sitting setting up this commission to begin with. But I agree that they have done outstanding work and I appreciate each of the commission members who sat--who served and their product. 
I do think it is the right thing to take some time and go through their recommendations because it's not just one issue that they address. They addressed a range of things. And--and so to--to give it its due, this is something that y'all are going to have to work on next year. But my point is this is better, this is more thoughtful, this is more wide ranging I think, as Ms. Davis was saying. It really gets to a lot of things in our society because this commission did such a good job. So 
I appreciate Ms. Houlahan And bringing it up, but also agreeing that we the Congress should--will take it seriously in the future. We should. I yield back. 
SMITH: Does anyone else seek recognition? Ms. Houlahan, my understanding is you wish to withdraw the amendment? 
HOULAHAN: Thank you. I would like to withdraw my amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Thank you very much. I appreciate that and I do appreciate all the work that has gone into this process and definitely agree with the importance of it. The amendment has been withdrawn and it is now in order to consider Log number 41. And for what purposes--purpose, sorry, does the gentle lady from Virginia seek recognition? 
LURIA: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment before the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the chair recognizes the gentlewoman for the purposes of explaining her amendment. 
LURIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment would include in this year's NDAA that language of my bipartisan bill, Healthcare Fairness and Military Families Act. As COVID-19 cases rise, there is significant economic uncertainty and employment instability. Current--currently, unemployment is highest among people ages 16 to 24 at a rate of approximately 27 percent. 
Many young Americans who lose their job or have trouble finding employment after graduating from college have their reassurance that they won't also lose their health care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, many young Americans can stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they're age 26. Unfortunately, children of military families and retirees cannot benefit from that same safety net and instead age out of Tricare at the age of 23. 
My amendment would bring equity to Tricare beneficiaries by conforming its eligibility requirements to those offered by private insurance plans that are regulated by the Affordable Care Act. This amendment would allow Tricare dependents to remain on their parents' plan until the age of 26 without an additional out of pocket cost. I'm aware of that there would be a point of order on this amendment because it impacts mandatory spending. But I think it's important to discuss ways our committee can do more to help military families and retirees, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. 
We all have a responsibility to ensure our service members and military families receive the benefits that they've earned. I had additionally planned on offering an amendment to require the Secretary of Defense to waive copayments from mail order generic drugs through Tricare during a national public health emergency. This amendment had the same issue related to increasing mandatory spending. 
However, military families and retirees have already sacrificed so much for our nation. We should always be looking for more ways to do right by them. Today, we can help thousands who have volunteered to serve our nation and their families to have affordable access to health care. But regrettably, I will withdraw this amendment, but I welcome any other remarks on this topic and would like to work together with my colleagues to support future efforts for these initiatives. 
SMITH: Thank you. The gentlelady withdraws the amendment. Sorry. Working my way through my color-coded tabs here. We will now consider en bloc package number two and the chair recognizes Ms. Speier for the purposes of offering the en bloc amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. En bloc package number two is comprised of the following. Excuse me. Log 7-- 
SMITH: --Actually, sorry. Script wise, you need to ask unanimous consent to bring it up first and then (INAUDIBLE)-- 
SPEIER: --All right. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Okay. The gentlelady requests unanimous consent to bring up en bloc package number--number two consisting of amendments that have been worked and improved by the minority--minority. Without objection, so ordered. Will a clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? 
Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. And Ms. Speier is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of explaining the en bloc amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The en bloc package is comprised of the following. Log 7 by Representative Slotkin, Log 140 by Representative Kelly, Log 541r2 by Representative Kelly, Log 83--83 by Representative Turner, Log 404 by Representative Davis, Log 130 by Representative Turner, Log 416r3 by Representative Brown, Log 31 by Representative Rogers, Log 202r1 by Representative Gabbard, Log 281r1 by Representative Cisneros, Log 29 by Representative Gallagher, Log 40 by Representative Gallagher, Log 75 by Representative Horn, Log 102r1 by Representative Gabbard, Log 139 by Representative Kelly, Log 147 by Representative Haaland, Log 174 by Representative Waltz, Log 180 by Representative Davis, Log 196r1 by Representative Abraham, Log 197 by Representative Gabbard, Log 208 by Representative Larsen, Log 214 by Representative Speier, Log 247 by Representative Hartzler, Log 267r1 by Representative Bacon, Log 301 by Representative Carbajal, Log 344 by Representative Houlahan, Log 476 by Representative Moulton, Log 595 by Representative Bishop, Log 4 by Representative Brown, Log 181 by Representative Davis, Log 286r1 by Representative Speier, Log 336 by Representative Escobar, Log 364 by Representative Speier, Log 382r1 by Representative Houlahan, Log 390r2 by Representative Luria, Log 419 by Representative Brown, Log 460 by Representative Carbajal, Log 498 by Representative Trahan, Log 520 by Representative Bergman, 534 by Representative Speier, Log 325 by Representative Haaland, Log 359 by Representative Houlahan, Log 194r1 by Representative Kelly, Log 454 by Representative Brindisi, Log 170 by Representative Gallego. 
SMITH: Is there a discussion of the en bloc package? If not, the question is on adoption of the en bloc package offered by Ms. Speier. So many as are in favor, will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. The ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. Sorry, just one quick second here. I think I know what comes next, I just want to be sure. Okay. If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Speier for the purposes of offering a motion. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me, before making the motion, compliment once again the Ranking Member Thornberry for all the work he and his spouse have done as it relates to families in the military and with that, Mr. Chairman, I will move to adopt the subcommittee report. The Subcommittee on Military Personnel as amended. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion of the gentlewoman from California. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed, no. A quorum being present, the ayes have it and the motion is adopted. I know I said 12:45, but we actually have a nice little break here before the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, so we are going to break for 30 minutes. We will reconvene--sorry recess for 30 minutes. We will reconvene at--we'll go an extra four minutes here. We'll reconvene at 1:10. And at that point, it we'll be taking up the Strategic Forces Subcommittee mark and moving forward from there. 
Yeah, I know that the votes are going to start, but remember we're going to roll through the votes. So even if votes are started, we'll try to get that done while continuing to move forward here. So, we'll be back at 1:10. 
(RECESS) 
The committee will reconvene, and we will now receive the report on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. Pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone all of the recorded votes on the amendments of this particular subcommittee mark until consideration of all amendments of the subcommittee mark has concluded. And the chair recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper, for his opening comments. 
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am proud today to speak on behalf of the strategic forces portion of the chairman's mark. I would like to thank Ranking Member Turner and all our subcommittee members on both sides of the aisle for their many contributions to the strategic forces mark. 
This mark is the result of months' long bipartisan process during a public health emergency in an effort to keep our long-standing tradition of producing a defense authorization bill. This subcommittee has particularly heavy, often highly technical responsibilities. This mark makes America stronger and safer by improving the odds for peace and stability by strengthening our nuclear forces, hypersonic weapons, and space and missile defenses. 
A nuclear attack on the United States, our forces abroad, or on our allies would be catastrophic. Preventing this attack is the first responsibility of the U.S. government. It is imperative to ensure our nuclear forces are safe, secure, reliable, and effective. This mark focuses on ensuring that the departments of defense and energy are wisely spending their larger budgets for maintaining our nuclear strength. It is the duty of the subcommittee to ensure that the department of energy's national nuclear administration, as well as, the entire department of defense execute this work in a responsible, effective, and efficient manner. 
In this context, this mark requires the president to participate in at least one nuclear command and control exercise and requires the department of defense to consolidate nuclear deterrents, space, and missile defense policy under one assistant secretary. In addition, it requires early coordination between NNSA and DOD to improve the budget process. After we saw a last-minute cut this past year of a nuclear submarine and a cut on nuclear cleanup, all in order to add $2.5 billion to the NNSA. The mark also requires a better understanding of unobligated and uncosted funds within NNSA. 
Regarding space, we continue our focus on increasing the resilience and capability of our space assets, specifically, the mark continues to require the Air Force procure commercial space domain awareness services and it builds on the congressional requirement for a program to incorporate allied positioning, timing, and navigation in order to disincentivize an attack on our GPS assets. It also includes a compromise on space launch that locks in phase 2 of the Space Force's five-year strategy while starting investments on phase 3 in order to maintain competition and to support innovative technologies in preparation for competition for launch awards after 2024. 
The mark focuses on near-term priorities for developing strategic hypersonic weapons in a way that avoids increasing the risks of ambiguity and miscalculation. It requires the Navy to initiate a program and provides the funding to do so that will deliver the conventional strompt--prompt strike hypersonic weapon onto a surface-based variant. With regards to missile defense, this mark continues efforts to increase reliability and capability of our homeland and regional missile defenses against missile threats from North Korea and Japan and Iran, including supporting U.S. Israeli missile defense cooperation. 
The chairman's mark once again provides additional funding for a space sensor layer that is capable of tracking both advanced ballistic and hypersonic missile threats, despite the Department of Defense's astonishing lack of focus on this effort over the past four years. In addition, after the failure of the redesigned kill vehicle program, we are carefully monitoring the next-generation interceptor program, and the mark adjusts funding for this program which is early to need in light of programmatic delays already experienced. 
That funding supports critical efforts in directed energy, additional regional defense interceptors, restoring a homeland defense radar in Hawaii, and also addresses critical technologies needed to advance testing for future hypersonic capabilities. I look forward to considering amendments of the strategic forces mark. But before I close, I would like to thank sincerely our incredible staff, Leonor Tomero, Jason Schmidt, Maria Vastola, Grant Schneider, and Zach Taylor. And now I turn to my ranking member, the gentleman from Ohio for his remarks. 
SMITH: The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for his opening remarks. 
TURNER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I would like to join with my chairman in thanking the staff, Dan Sennett (SP), Doug Bush, Jason Schmidt, Leonor Tomero, Maria Vastola, Grant Schneider, and Zach Taylor. They have worked under unbelievably difficult conditions while access to members has been--have been more difficult and in--are not being able to have proximity. And I greatly appreciate their substantive knowledge. 
I also want to thank Chairman Smith. This year, we have unbelievable bipartisan process that is moving forward, and I know that it came from his personal commitment to this and I want to thank him for that. And I know it--it takes the leadership of Ranking Member Thornberry and Chairman Smith to be able to accomplish that and so it travels down through all of our subcommittees and certainly our debate today. 
And in that, you can look at--at our mark as an example, nearly half of all the provisions that are in our mark were requested by both Democrats and Republicans. And as you know, we have the most important issues of missile, missile defense, you know our nuclear enterprise and space that are--are areas where we are currently investing and having that level of engagement is incredibly important. 
I want to thank the chairman for we have included a provision in this bill that--this mark that looks to foreign countries and what they are doing in their nuclear enterprise. When we look at what we need to do with ours in modernizing, in tailoring our needs and capabilities, looking to what our adversaries are doing is incredibly important. We have access to information on--on a classified basis, but it's not information that we're able to take forward into a public debate or to a debate into this body. And so, we're asking for assistance in producing non-classified information for which we can all then share and share with the public for the greater understanding of what our threats are. 
And I think that's one of the most important things that we have as a responsibility is try to defeat the capabilities of our adversaries. I appreciate the chairman's statement that our first responsibility is to make certain that we do not have a nuclear attack. Every day, our nuclear assets work. They work to deter adversaries, they work to ensure that we have peace. In that, this mark is making great progress in ensuring that the nuclear weapons enterprise can develop and maintain the capabilities that we require to ensure safe, effective, and reliable nuclear deterrent. 
You can't just build a nuclear weapon and put in a silo and be a nuclear-weapons state forever. You have to reinvest in it, you have to modernize, you have to--to look for areas in which it's degrading and to upgrade it. Our entire triad needs that work and it needs it now. We've put it off for far too long. There's measures in this bill that go right to the STRATCOM commander's requirements of need for investing. 
We are seeing with Russia and the already deployment of their hypersonic weapons, Skyfall where they're looking to field a nuclear-powered cruise missile. Poseidon where they're looking to have an underwater, unmanned nuclear missile. A greater increase in the need for our--our to--for us to ensure that what we have works and that it will deter our adversaries. 
I also want to take a moment--when Chairman Speier was speaking, I didn't want to take additional time out of that debate, but I want to thank Chairman Speier for their work on sexual assault in the military and working with the Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus. And with that, I want to thank Susan Davis, my co-chair who's retiring. Susan, you have been absolutely incredible in diligently working on bipartisan solutions to what I think is one of the most important issues that we have which is how do we ensure that our servicemembers are protected from violent sexual assault from other servicemembers and protect their right. So, thank you and we're very sorry to see you go and miss you in that. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you very much. As you can tell, votes are--have been called. So, for those of you who are not participating in upcoming debates, you can vote sooner or later, however you want to handle it. I think we'll probably have about 40, 45 minutes for the vote. So, we are now going to attempt to keep rolling here while everyone gets their votes done. 
With that, is there discussion on the subcommittee mark? Hearing none, we'll move on to amendments. And it is in order to consider en bloc package number one and the chair recognizes Mr. Cooper for the purposes of offering the en bloc amendment. 
COOPER: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number 1 consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with a minority. 
SMITH: Without objection, so ordered. And will the clerk please distribute the amendment--the en bloc amendment--sorry. Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. And Mr. Cooper is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of the explaining the en bloc amendment. 
COOPER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. The en bloc package number one is comprised of the following, Log 82r2 by Representative Gabbard, Log 92r1 by Representative Turner, Log 100r1 by Representative Turner, Log 131 by Representative Turner, Log 146 by Representative Haaland, Log 226r3 by Representative Lamborn, Log 369r2 by Representative Banks, Log 420r1 by Representative Garamendi, Log 510 by Representative Brooks, Log 512 by Representative Brooks, Log 567 by Representative Cooper, Log 577r1 by Representative Brown, Log 126 by Representative Turner, Log 136r2 by Representative Lamborn, Log 211r2 by Representative Larsen, Log 277 by Representative Carbajal, Log 436 by Representative Trahan, Log 493r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 531r1 by Representative Lamborn, Log 166 by Representative Brooks, Log 372 by Representative Haaland, Log 1--15r1 by Representative Bacon, and Log 308 by Representative Lamborn. 
SMITH: Thank you. As--as frequently happens, I was wrong. They actually went out and we're not voting apparently until 1:40 so, I apologize for the bad information. I'm sure all of you knew that and were just too polite to point--point out the incorrection there. So--so, we're not voting for another 10 or 15 minutes. Is there discussion on the en bloc package? Mr. Rogers? 
ROGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I just want to highlight a couple of good amend--a couple of good amendments that are in this package regarding the Ligado FCC decision. And I want to say that this discussion also impacts commercial satellite operations. At a time when we're pushing the DOD to use more commercial satellite services, it's just another reason the decision by the FCC was wrong. And with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Further discussion on the en bloc amendments? Hearing none, the question is on adoption of the en bloc package offered by Mr. Cooper. So, any of us that are in favor will say, aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed? The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. We will now be considering Log 266 and for what purpose does Mr. Cooper seek recognition? 
COOPER: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the court please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. And Mr. Cooper is recognized to discuss his amendment. 
COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment requires an independent cost estimate of the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility and plans and certifications from STRATCOM and the Secretary of Energy to make sure that the cost and schedule are not found by the EIS to be achievable at less than a 90 percent confidence interval. 
Members of this committee know full well problems that we've had in the past with premature and sometimes inadequate construction plans. We want to make sure that there are not unnecessary delays or cost overruns at Savannah River. Savannah River SRPPF construction schedule is likely to be extremely expensive and most people think it's unlikely to be completed on time. 
This amendment would ensure that both STRATCOM and the Secretary of Energy agree in advance that the plan is achievable. And if not, to provide alternative schedules. That's a short description of the amendment. I would urge that my colleagues support the amendment. 
SMITH: All right. I'll recognize Mr. DesJarlais. Yes. 
DESJARLAIS: Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: I'm sorry, I think--you're recognized. Go ahead. 
DESJARLAIS: I'd like to speak in opposition to the amendment. 
SMITH: The gentleman is recognized. 
DESJARLAIS: The DOD's requirement to produce no fewer than 80 PPYs by 2027 is driven by several factors, including advanced warhead safety and security, mitigating risk against plutonium aging, and responding to an uncertain future due to renewed global competition. According to the NNSA Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the requirement of 80 pits per year is at the low end. The requirement given the pace and scope of our current modernization program and further delay will increase the PPY need. 
On March 28, 2019, General Hyten said, ""I'm concerned about building new weapons that will have 100 year-old plutonium pits. I think that this is just a risk that the United States should not take."" At a time when we are undergoing nuclear modernization in all three legs of the triad with multiple warhead life, extensions, and--and it is irresponsible to continue using aged plutonium pits whose safety and surety attributes may be unpredictable. 
We need peace through strength and failing to invest in 80 pits per year by 2027 seriously weakens our nation's deterrence and our industrial capacity to produce and secure those weapons. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Wilson. 
WILSON: Thank--thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, would like to speak in opposition and I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak. And I appreciate the concerns by Chairman Cooper, but this amendment aims to target the two-site solution of--to plutonium pit production in favor of a singular perilous approach. 
The two-site solution has been supported, as previously stated by Congressman DesJarlais, not only by the National Nuclear Security Administration, but also the Nuclear Weapons Council, STRATCOM Commander Admiral Charles Richard, and former STRATCOM commander and current vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Hyten as the best way to manage the cost, schedule, and risk of such a vital undertaking. 
The NNSA conducted an--an analysis of alternatives and engineering assessment and a workforce analysis by both internal and external experts already to develop the recommendation of a two site solution. Since taking over this project, the M&O contractor at the Savannah River Site has had over 440 staff and subcontractors now supporting the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility, SRPPF, design effort with engineers at SRS, Los--Los Alamos, Greenville, South Carolina, and Denver, Colorado in addition to five employees working at Los Alamos this month, with an additional 15 more for FY21. 
The contractor is scheduled to deliver a conceptual design report in CD-1 package by the end of December 2020. And their oversight of the transition from the MOX facility to the SRPPF is ahead of schedule and forecasted to be completed by April 2021, six months early. And 70 percent of the total inventory will remain at the SRS site for future use. 
Regarding cost for the site, the engineering assessment for May 2018 listed the two site solution costing approximately $14 billion more than the Los Alamos options, however according to the Institute for Defense Analyses report on pit production, the lifecycle cost analysis for 80 pits per year omitted a significant number of personnel required for the support activities for all Los Alamos cost options, closing much of the cost gap between the two site versus one site solution. 
In fact, it can be estimated that the cost withheld from those calculators--calculations far surpass the lifecycle cost of the two site solution possibly by billions of dollars. Since the pre-conceptual design used in 2018 EA, the current design has matured significantly and new more accurate costs will be updated in CD-1. According to the Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Council, we need to produce no fewer than 80 pits per year by 2030. We need a second plutonium pit production facility to meet those needs and the Savannah River site is by far the best option. I strongly oppose this amendment and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Turner. 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I think I want to refer to the chairman of the subcommittee's words as our reflection of why we should defeat the chairman's own amendment. As he was giving his description of the subcommittee mark, he said this subcommittee mark meets the needs of our nuclear enterprise. 
It's really not up for debate. The Secretary of Energy, the head of NNSA, STRATCOM, all of DOD have indicated that we're to a critical point. We have for far too long undertaken the political debate of let's all go March this way and then let's stop and then let's all go March this way and bemoaned the increased cost that--that modernizing our nuclear weapons enterprise sustains because of the whipsaw from one direction to the other direction. 
We're now too, whether--where we have to pick a direction. We have to fund the direction. And we have to execute the direction in order to ensure that we have an effective nuclear deterrent for adversaries, and that's just to give us a nuclear deterrent that's capable of--to--as to what we currently plan for and have as of today. Our adversaries are already reaching well beyond our capabilities. 
And we're not doing that in this bill. We're not--there's not one new advanced capability that we're fielding, but our adversaries are. This--this is one of the additional aspects of let's have--have more delay--delay. Now, I--I agree with the chairman. I have been incredibly frustrated with the waste of cost that we've had, largely as a result of us. Not because of nuclear weapon enterprise or the NNSA has--have been wasting money. It's because we give them conflicting policy goals and objectives and conflicting execution for trying to achieve what we all know what we have to achieve which is an effective and reliable deterrent. This is just more of that. 
We already know, Secretary of Energy, we must do this. NNSA, Lisa Gordon-Hannity (PH), we must do this. STRATCOM, we must do this. DOD, we must do this. So, let's just go forward, get this done, and then we can at least look backwards and say that we have protected our country and done what was needed in order to ensure that we do have that deterrence that, as the chairman says, keep us safe every day. And if I do have time left, I will yield mine to the chairman. 
COOPER: Thank you, my friend, the gentleman from Ohio. I agree with most of what you are saying. I think it has very little to do with my amendment, however. All I really want is for DOD and DoE to coordinate. And sadly, that hasn't happened sometimes in the past. The gentleman knows that my amendment really doesn't threaten the 80 pit requirement. It really doesn't threaten two sites. All I want to know is that when we build the second site that it not be delayed or have excessive cost overruns. And that requires coordination between NNSA, DoE, and DOD which sadly hasn't happened sometimes in the past. 
So, really this is just an independent study, that's all it is. So, that--and the gentleman is entirely correct, so often problems in the past have been our own fault because there hasn't been coordination. So, I agree with the gentleman. I actually agree with most of the comments of my friends on the other side. This is just a study to make sure we do it right and to make sure that DOD and DoE are really talking to each other and that they agree. The first party has to be to make sure that Los Alamos can do it because they haven't built the 30 pit year thing yet. They don't--not quite sure exactly how they're going to do it. So, once they're successful, let's make sure that we can do it right, get another site. 
TURNER: I'm reclaiming my time then. The--the chairman has within his--his own authority to call a hearing, request all of these people to provide those assurances, and request that they come back and provide any additional information. We don't need to put in law asking people to confirm what they've already confirmed and what we're actually funding. But, you know, I understand that--I appreciate that the--the chairman has articulated that he recognizes the need that we have in this market because we really are to a critical juncture. Thank you. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Garamendi. 
GARAMENDI: The history of this re-starting the pit production is a history of uncertainty as to how best to do it, where to do it, and certainly history of extraordinary inability to estimate the cost of the efforts that have been made in the past and ongoing. The chairman's proposal is what we ought to do with every very expensive project in which there's uncertainty, and that is bring in an independent organization that doesn't have skin in the game, isn't part of the process, but is capable of an analysis of what is happening, how it can best be done, and what the costs are. 
The chairman said it very well, Los Alamos is the laboratory, the starting point of how these new--how these pits are going to be produced. The kinds of techniques, technology, equipment, safety, all that is being developed at Los Alamos and it is not yet complete. To move forward with Savannah River without knowing those costs and those activities and risks is, in my view, foolish. Nevertheless, this amendment doesn't stop that from happening or slow it down, it simply says somebody better--some other entity ought to take a look so we have some knowledge about the status, the cost, as well as the appropriateness of the various technologies and techniques that are going to be used in producing the pits. 
So, I think it makes eminent sense. And we're talking about a big ticket here. We're not talking about a few hundred million, we're talking about tens of billions of ultimately be spent. So, I think this is the wise way to go. And there's no harm--never any harm in gathering more information about a major defense project. I support the amendment. 
SMITH: Thank you. I--I recognize my--myself to--to comment on this in speaking in support of the amendment. I think this amendment captures a lot of the--the conversations we've had around nuclear issues. And you know, I have worked with Mr. Turner and others to--to get to a place where the committee can work together and move forward in a positive direction. And I will say there's you know, one set of those arguments is about whether or not we need the nuclear arsenal that is contemplated by the nuclear posture review. 
As everyone knows, I don't agree with that assessment. I do recognize that it was the assessment of both the Obama administration and the Trump administration, but I--I disagree with it. But I'm putting all of that to the side for the moment. We had that debate last year. It came out the way it came out. It's not going to change this year. You know, in the--in the future, we may--we may want to discuss it. But putting that aside for the moment, even if you accept the nuclear posture review and accept, okay, this is what we have to do, I have considerable concerns about whether or not that money is going to be spent wisely and efficiently by the NNSA. 
And Mr--Mr. Turner's also correct that a good chunk of this is--is our fault. I believe Mr. Cooper coined the phrase the--the zombie earmark on the MOX facility and we certainly contributed to that. I do not however, as I look at the record, find the NNSA blameless in--in this process. When it comes to the MOX facility, it's important that we understand what they were talking about doing there. And I actually went over the course of the last year and I visited Los Alamos and I also visited Savannah River. I thank the New Mexico delegation for hosting me in New Mexico and I thank Mr. Wilson for hosting me in South Carolina. 
And the effort here is to build more pits. Let me--let me also say that even with my sort of lesser viewpoint of what we need in terms of nuclear weapons, we need more pits. I do not dispute that in the least bit. You know, whether or not it's 30 or 80 is, you know, a different debate. Again, we had that debate last year. It came out the way it came out. My concern is that we develop the ability to build pits period, that we don't sort of spread ourselves all over the place and wind up without even having the 30 that pretty much everybody agrees that we're going to need I think it's by 2024, soon in any grade. 
So, apologize for this, but if you go down to Savannah River, what they're talking about doing--first of all, just a little history lesson on the MOX facility. The idea--there was a reason for it--was to reprocess plutonium through the MOX facility to make fuel for nuclear power plants. Now, there was always a flaw in that and that is that none of the nuclear plant--power plants in the United States actually use that particular type of fuel and there was no clear plan for how that fuel was going to get to nuclear power plants overseas that did use that fuel. But that went on for quite a while. 
But then it was determined--and I want to say at least six, seven years ago--that there is no way on earth that they were going to be able to generate fuel that was actually going to be used in a power plant. And they continue to build the facility to the tune of five to $6 billion. And the NNSA continued to ask for the money. Now, they did ask for the money that they said they needed this money to shut down the program. And I know nuclear stuff is complicated and all that but five, $6 billion over the course of seven years to shut down a program doesn't strike me as overwhelmingly efficient. 
The building that is now down in Savannah River was built for the MOX facility, and it's a very impressive building. It's not quite complete. It is a whole lot of concrete and a whole lot of places. And what they're talking about doing now is converting that building to make it so that it can make pits. That's not an easy thing to do. Now everyone down there assured me that they could absolutely do it. This isn't like, I don't know, remodeling a bowling alley into a restaurant. You--you've got to move a lot of very thick concrete walls around. And you've got to make sure it works. 
Seeing what they did at Los Alamos, it's very difficult to make these things. So, I am worried that we are going to spend billions of dollars just like we did on the MOX facility to get nothing. And that would not be good whether you support my position on the nuclear posture review or if you support Mr. Turner's position on the nuclear posture review. If you ask me, you know, I have to bet a hundred dollars on whether or not Savannah River is going to be able to successfully produce pits in a way that gets us to the 80 pit requirement by I think it's 2030, 2027, someone said--I thought it was later than that, but anyway. I would confidently bet a hundred dollars that they're not going to get there, okay? 
And I might well be wrong, but the doubts are deep, well-founded, and--and you know, plenty of good solid backing for those doubts as--as we go forward and try to figure out how to do this. And all this amendment says is you're going to need to do a little bit more to--to take away those doubts so that we aren't spending money in a way that's not going to produce pits. So, I--I have my worries about NNSA and I'm--I'm standing down on that--that fight for the most part this year. 
But what I hope is, regardless again, for how much money you think we want to spend on nuclear weapons, let's just make sure that we don't send another five to $8 billion down the toilet like--like--like we did at the MOX facility because that doesn't serve any of our interests. So, this strikes me as--as a reasonable approach to say, let's keep an eye on you. Because as bad as Congress was in terms of what we directed the NNSA to do, they haven't always been as efficient as I think they should be either. This--this is an accountability measure and I think it's a very commonsense accountability measure and I support Mr. Cooper's amendment. Who seeks recognition? All right--sorry. The first time we're going to have a voting amendment, so I have to make sure I've got the script right here. If not, the question occurs on the amendment offered by Mr. Cooper. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. 
UNKNOWN: I ask for a recorded vote. 
SMITH: Recorded vote has been requested. Here we go. 
UNKNOWN: What do I say now? 
SMITH: I think I know. The--the further--further proceedings going to submit will be suspended until the end of the mark in which we will--case we will have the rollcall vote, or more accurately the rollcall vote is ordered but will call this rollcall vote at the end of our consideration of the subcommittee's mark which is kind of what I said. So, we will now move on. 
MITCHELL: Mr. Chair? 
SMITH: I'm sorry, who's? 
MITCHELL: Mr. Chair? 
SMITH: Who's talking? Oh. 
MITCHELL: Way down here. 
SMITH: Mr--Mr. Mitchell, yes. 
MITCHELL: I'd like to make a unanimous consent request that we dispose of what another chair called the rigmarole. We all know the spiel on postponing votes and just say we're going to postpone till later and save your breath and save time. 
SMITH: Okay. From a procedural standpoint, I--I do have to let people know that that's what's happening otherwise it sort of hangs out there and we're--I--I will try to be crisper and clearer in the future in getting to that part. All right, thank you. It is now in order to consider number 424--I forget what we call those things, amendment number 424 and--Log number 424 and for what purposes--purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? 
GARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. And without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. Votes have now been called. I--I'm actually correct about that this time. So, keep an eye on it and make sure you come and go and get the votes in an--and we will continue to proceed. With that, Mr. Garamendi is recognized for five minutes to explain his amendment. 
GARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman and members, this amendment pretty much falls along on the discussion we just had. And it's really the acquisition of knowledge and information. As we discussed a moment ago with regard to the costs and the issues surrounding a pit production at--in Savannah River, this amendment will allow us--would give us an independent study on extending the Minuteman III ICBMs, their utility and their usefulness into the future. 
Some might argue that knowing how long and how useful these Minuteman III missile--ICBM missiles would work would somehow delay, cut, or otherwise impede the ground-based strategic deterrent program. I think not. But it would sure be good for us to know, do we really have a problem with the Minuteman III aging out anytime soon. There's some indication that they won't. In which case, the question arises about the development of a new missile and when that new missile might be needed. 
So, why do we so oppose information? Why do we not want to know about the Minuteman III and its usefulness over time? Can its utility, can its usefulness be extended or not? So that's what this is all about. This was actually in the mark last year and dropped out very, very late in the morning. Or I guess early in the morning actually, about 2 AM on a very confusing debate that went on at that moment. So, I'm trying to gather information. And I would think it's in the interest of all of us that we have all of the knowledge possible as we undertake a very, very expensive and strategically important process of how do we provide the motors, rockets for our ground-based strategic deterrent program. 
So, that's what it's all about. It's another study. This one, like the previous debate on the pit production at Savannah River, is critically important piece of knowledge that we need to carry out our tasks here. So, I would ask for an aye vote on this study amendment. 
SMITH: Thank you. I'll just make one quick comment. We--we did have this debate last year and the big point that's different, we have studied the lifetime of this missile, there's no question about that. Those studies have focused on whether or not it could last 80 years. What this is saying is there is some indication that it might last less than that. And 40 or 50 years could buy us some time and potentially save us some money. 
So, I know the arguments will come. We have study, study, study, study. Those studies have been over an 80-year period. This is for a period-- about half of that. So, that--that's the difference in what Mr. Garamendi is offering. I do support the amendment. And I now call upon Mr. Bacon. 
BACON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'm good friends with Mr. Garamendi. We've worked on quite a few issues together in this markup. But I have to respectfully oppose this amendment. We can--my personal opinion, after three decades in the Air Force and working at times in the nuclear force of our Air Force, it is of my opinion--my humble opinion that we can no longer delay modernizing our third leg of the triad, our ICBM IVs. It is beyond time to do it. We're talking 4 1/2 decades old with our ICBMs now and our air--Air Force, our DOD have said it's imperative that we start this modernization now. 
Now, as the chairman says, we have had multiple studies on amendment three, life extension possibilities. And the Air Force has come back repeatedly saying a service life expansion program is not cheaper in the long run than putting in the ground-based strategic deterrent program now. We need the modernization now in--in so many words. 
We also had this exact language closely last--last chairman's mark, last year. And it was dropped in conference. And it is my opinion, too, talking to our senators, they will not entertain this as a reasonable offer. They will either press forward or (INAUDIBLE) with our modernization as well. So, the Air Force is committed to the ground-based strategic deterrent program. Our current mark fully funds it. It has 15 million in milicon (SP) to support critical planning and design work. 
The minute--the Minuteman III was first put into the ground 47 years ago. That's the Minuteman III. it's already undergone two Service Life Extension Programs. So, the Air Force maintains concern over the industrial base's ability to support the SLEP and the ability to actually do a third SLEP on these ICBMs. 
Further, the stra--our strategic commands puts this down as the top priority, the need to put in G--put in the new ICBM will improve our survivability. So, we can--we can no longer kick the can on this program. So, I'll just close with this, we need to modernize triad for nuclear deterrence. Strategic de--deterrence is the top priority of our military and our military experts and studies so we--we cannot do a third service life extension. It's the time to look forward on this and not backwards when it comes to our triad. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield. 
GARAMENDI: Mr--would the gentleman yield for a question? 
BACON: I--I yield. I gave back totally 
SMITH: He yield--he yielded his time. Who seeks recognition? Mr. Bishop. 
BISHOP: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As much as I appreciate the statements by Mr. Garamendi as to his purpose, it is true we have studied this. There have been studies before. We are studying all over the time. Another study would do nothing more than, once again, change and delay the implementation of what we are trying to get to. And it is very clear, as the military has said, the Air Force has said, it is not cheaper to extend this program than to develop the ground-based strategic defense program. 
We are--this situation since this work is done very close to me, we--we are in the situation where the blueprints of many of the parts that are used in the Minuteman III no longer exist. The staff at the depots have to create it. That staff at the depots actually have to get parts off of eBay and then modify them because the companies that produced the parts in the first place are no longer there, and they're not producing it. 
So, what we are doing if indeed this is to get information, that's nice. But if this actually results in the delaying of the program--so once again our entire program of--of modernization is going to be off sync, that's counterproductive. That doesn't save us any money. We have had these studies. We have made these decisions before. Now it is extremely important that we move on and I appreciate--I appreciate the chairman's time and, Mr. Chairman, if you recognize in about three seconds or were to turn around, or even the staff would look at something, I'm ready to--I reserve--I mean I yield back. 
SMITH: Okay, thank you. Ms. Cheney. 
CHENEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And--and--I--I want to echo my respect for and appreciation for what my colleague, Mr. Garamendi, has been able to work with us on on a number of other issues. But as you--as you know, Mr. Chairman, this is very similar language to language that was offered last--last year. And--and at the time, I asked that these reports next to me that have covered exactly this issue be entered into the record. I would ask unanimous consent that they be entered into the record once again. 
We simply are--are in a situation, Mr. Chairman, as my colleagues have pointed out where we know the answer to this question. I--I think that the issue is not frankly that we need more reports, I think it's that my colleagues don't like the answer to the question and the answer to the question is, we cannot delay any longer. That, again and again and again, there has been exhaustive analysis done on whether or not this service life extension is feasible, is advisable, and is cost-effective. And the answer in all of those cases has been no. We must move forward modernizing. 
We--we cannot defend either from the perspective of what needs to be done in terms of maintaining our deterrence in the face of great power struggle and conflict or from the perspective of saying we need to study one more time. We can't defend a delay here. Our responsibility t--is to ensure that this modernization be completed. And that's modernization, by the way, that administrations of both parties in the last four nuclear posture reviews have said is absolutely crucial. 
So, I would just urge my colleagues not to go down the path of--of simply saying we're going to study and get more information. We have all the information we need. And there isn't even any disagreement in these reports. They all come to the same conclusion. So, I--I don't see how we can responsibly carry out our obligation to provide for this modernization if we simply say we're going to delay this and seek yet one more report. So, I--I would urge my colleagues-- 
GARAMENDI: --Will the gentle lady yield for a question? 
CHENEY: Yes, I will yield. 
GARAMENDI: Thank you very much. Perhaps in that stack of reports, there is a--is testimony from the House Armed Services Committee last year in which General Clark said there is one more opportunity to do that for these weapons. He was referring to a service life extension. What I'm trying to get at here is, what did General Clark mean? Is there an opportunity to extend the Minuteman III to 2050? I think those reports speak to 20-- 
CHENEY: --Re--regaining--regaining my time, Mr. Garamendi-- 
GARAMENDI: --Certainly. Thank you for the opportunity. 
CHENEY: Thank you, I appreciate that. I--I would say what is in this report is--in this stack of reports language including language from the ICBM modernization report that was done in 2013, frankly, by the GAO that makes clear that the assessment's got to be done, that they've got to look at the alternatives. But that we've got to ensure that a cost-effective approach is--is adopted and is agreed to. And subsequent to that, in 2018 in the Nuclear Posture Review, it was clear that we must and will begin to field the replacement. 2019, AFPC strategic primer, we've got to continue our support for the ground brace--based strategic deterrence. Th--sustaining the nuclear--U.S. nuclear deterrent, a study that was done by CSBA made clear in 2018, replacing the Minuteman III is the best option to sustain the land-based leg of the triad. 
And I'm happy to go through this entire list in terms of the importance of the ICBMs, the importance of ensuring we modernize, move to the GBSD, and that it's vital that we simply cannot have any further delay. And so, I think that--that at this point, the notion that somehow we need to study this further is just simply not sustainable. So, again I would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. And I--I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Turner. 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I wish we had the ability to vote on causing China to delay their hypersonics or their ground-based road mobile or tunnel mobile ICBMs. I--I wish we could vote on Russia delaying their already deployed hypersonics, land-based cruise missiles. I wish we could vote on Russia delaying their Sky fall that is nuclear powered, the world has never seen a cruise missile like this. But--but we can't delay what our opposition's doing and what our adversaries are doing. 
The only thing we can do is unhindered and with full support proceed to ensure that our capabilities are protected. Now, Mr. Garamendi, who I have a great deal of respect for, if you really want to know what General Clark said with respect to in an obscure statement of an opportunity in testimony, I'd be glad to join with you on a letter because a letter sounds like an appropriate response to General Clark, I'm not quite certain what it was that you said. 
What we do know unequivocally, what General Hyten said when General Hyten came before this committee, March 28, 2019, commander of the U.S. strategic forces at the top--strategic command at the time, is now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He said Minuteman III life extension is not cost-effective nor it will provide a weapon system, and this is the--this is the pause--this is the important part, this is why talk about China and Russia--capable of adapting to advancing technology and changing adversary threats. 
I'm not worried about 2050 or 2080, I'm worried about like right now. China and Russia are proceeding at such a rapid pace that we need to unhindered and with full support modernize and move forward. Now, you've requested in this an independent study. Now, as Chairwoman Cheney was saying, this has been studied and been studied and been studied. You usually do an independent study when you don't trust those who have studied it the first time or when there is contradiction among the studies or there is contradiction of even of the policy. Nowhere--nowhere in DOD does anybody step forward and say, ""I don't have confidence in these studies"" or ""do I not think that we need to move forward in this"". There is no within DOD. 
The only conflict is a political conflict. It's not substantive. It's not technological. This is not one of--of a mischaracterization of our adversaries. This is just a political discussion. And--and from a political basis, we need to get behind what's in this mark which is move forward to ensure that we have a reliable and capable (INAUDIBLE) deterrent. But if you have a concern about General Clark's statement, I'd be glad to--to join with you on a letter inquiring as to what his statement was. Mr. Chairman, I--I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Just one final comment on--well final comment by me on this. I--I think the issue, as we're talking about what Russia and China are doing, let me just be clear, we have to have an adequate nuclear deterrent in the U.S. The debate is over what is that adequate nuclear deterrent. As I've argued before, we have, I don't know somewhere in the neighborhood of 4000 nuclear weapons. The purpose of those nuclear weapons is to deter our adversaries, without question. What I do question is the idea that we have to build more and more and more and different weapons in order to accomplish that deterrent. 
Now, yes, if they're building new weapons, how does that make our 4000 nuclear weapons incapable of deterring? That's the debate that at some point in the future I would look--look forward to having. But I want to make it perfectly clear, not my position or Mr. Garamendi's position or anyone's position on this committee that I'm aware of, that we should not have an adequate nuclear deterrent. The difference of opinion is what--what does that adequate nuclear deterrent look like. Does anyone else seek recognition on this particular amendment? If not, if you would bear with me for a moment I need to put my glasses back on and get to the script. If not questions on the adoption and the amendment offered by Mr. Garamenti--Garamendi so many that I was are in favor, say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: So many here as opposed will say, no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: The opinion of the chair, the noes have it. I'm--do we know where Mr. Garamendi went? Yeah, I'm sorry, I've got--the noes have it, the amendment is defeated. It is now--well--now we really do need Mr. Garamendi. 
UNKNOWN: If you're not here, you can't do it, right? 
SMITH: If anybody knows where he is. 
UNKNOWN: He had to go vote. He had to go vote. 
SMITH: Yeah, best laid plans. We will have to go into a recess for--well--can we do the--do the en bloc, or do we have to? 
UNKNOWN: It was defeated. 
SMITH: Okay. Beg your pardon. So, we--we will go into recess for 15 minutes until we can get everybody back. As Mr. Garamendi has the next amendment, he's next in order, so we--we will have to go to recess for 15 minutes. We'll be back in at 1:25--is it 2? I can't tell what time it is. 
UNKNOWN: We have to have a vote. 
SMITH: Pardon? 
UNKNOWN: We have to have a vote. 
SMITH: Well, we've got a couple more amendments. Yeah, I know, at some point we will. It we'll--we'll get to that when we get to it, but we've got--we've got to go through the amendments before we get to the end of this mark. 
UNKNOWN: Are we adjourned for 15? I'm going to go vote. 
SMITH: We are in recess for the next, at least 15 minutes and then we'll reconvene. Everyone can go vote. We're going to reconvene in 10 minutes and figure out how we want to proceed at that point. 
(RECESS) 
SMITH: And there we are; just got to wait a certain amount of time. Okay. So, we are reconvening. And what we are going to do, I think--well, I know we're going to give it a shot, anyway, is Mr. Garamendi has agreed to withdraw the last amendment that he has an STRATCOM. So, we are--we are done with amendments on STRATCOM. So, the business in front of us now is to vote on Mr. Cooper's amendment. 
We are going to do this in sort of a Senate floor-like fashion, in a very slow moving--well, let's put it this way. We're going to--and I know the staff is going to want to kill me, but we're--we're--we're going to call through the role. We'll--we'll get who we can get, and then we will hold it open as members come back in. And if we could email, text, get a hold of everybody and let them know this is going on, that they could get back in. And we're going to give everyone a chance to vote and make sure we get every vote, and my understanding is the only person who's not here at this point and not going to be voting is Mr. Gallagher. 
So, we'll get everyone's vote before we proceed, but we're going to move to the roll call on Mr. Cooper. So, I have a script here, I think. Spencer (SP), you want to show me where I'm supposed to be? It's always good to just show me anyway. 
Okay. So, we are now going to proceed to votes on those amendments where a roll call vote was ordered. The committee postponed further proceedings on amendment Log number 266 offered by Mr. Cooper, and we shall now resume those proceedings. For those of you don't recall, Mr. Cooper's amendment is to require the--a 90 percent assurance that it can in fact work, basically, to build pits at Savannah River, and we had that debate. 
So, the question will now occur on that amendment, and the clerk will call the roll, with one quick second. We are--we've got some people participating remotely as well. So, we'll go through them as well. And then, once we're through the first series, we'll go through a second series, and then we'll give members the opportunity to come back in and identify themselves and vote. 
So, the clerk will call the roll.

So, once you get this vote done, we are then going to move into the full committee mark, which will debate the amendments that will be shown in order. The vote that's going on on the floor, I urge you to pay no attention to the alphabet. Vote whenever you want to vote. 
But--so, as soon as you're done voting here, you can go vote there, and then we're not going to have any votes back in here for quite a while. This is the only vote. So, vote-wise, you will not miss a vote in this committee once you are recorded voting on this amendment. The clerk shall proceed.

SMITH: All right. If the clerk will suspend for just a moment, so now what we have to do is, as members come in--come back in, and we've got the staff reaching out to the members who have not yet voted, we--we will have them vote and we--we are going to continue to hold this vote open until we get those votes. 
And with that, I'm going to go vote on the floor. And Ms. Davis, if you could just sort of every few minutes--you know, let's keep an eye, make sure we remind people as they come in, if they have not been recorded, to record them. And at some point--actually, right now why don't you read out for us the list of members who have not yet voted? 
CLERK: Mr. Wilson, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Cook, Mr. Keating, Ms. Cheney, Mr. Brindisi. 
SMITH: Oh, it's not as bad as I thought it would be. All right. So, we'll--we'll--if we could try and track those folks down, get them back in here as soon--Mr. Wilson, how would you like to be recorded? 
WILSON: No. 
CLERK: Mr. Wilson votes no. 
SMITH: Thank you. All right. I'm going to go vote. As members come in, if we could just sort of a direct them toward--make sure we get those votes counted. As soon as we're done with everyone voting, we will move on from there. But for now, the vote remains open. 
BRINDISI: Aye. 
CLERK: Mr. Brindisi votes aye. 
COOPER: Mr. Chairman, how am I recorded?

CLERK: Mr. Cook is not recorded. 
SMITH: Mr. Cook, can--you going to vote? Be sure and vote right now. Can you vote now? 
CLERK: Mr. Cook?

CLERK: Mr. Cook votes no. 
SMITH: Ms. Cheney? How is Ms. Cheney recorded? 
CLERK: Ms. Cheney is not recorded. 
CHENEY: I vote no. 
CLERK: Ms. Cheney votes no. 
SMITH: Okay. The clerk will report the tally. 
CLERK: Mr. Chairman, on this vote, the ayes are 31 and the noes are 25. 
SMITH: The amendment is adopted. If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper, for the purposes of offering a motion. 
COOPER: Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt the subcommittee report of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion from the gentleman from Tennessee. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed? Ayes have it. A quorum being present, the ayes have it and the motion is adopted. 
All right. The committee will now consider the chairman's mark. Pursuant to Committee Rule XVII and in consultation with the ranking member, we will postpone recorded votes and amendments until a mutually agreed time. I've kind of already made my opening statement, so I will skip past that, but I will now turn to Mr. Thornberry for any comments he may wish to make. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I likewise made my comments at the beginning of the markup, so I would yield back. 
SMITH: Before moving to our amendments, is there any discussion of the chairman's mark? 
We will now consider en bloc package number one. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number one, consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendment? 
Without objection, the--the--the amendments are considered as read. And now it's that ever exciting point in the markup when it's my turn to read through the list. So, en bloc package number one is comprised of the following; Log 25r1 by Representative Gallagher, 71r2 by Representative Gallagher, Log 81r2 by Representative Golden, Log 99r1 by Representative Horn, Log 121r1 by Representative Garamendi, Log 129r1 by Representative Turner, Log 153r2 by Representative Davis, Log 182--sorry, by Representative Haaland, Log 182 by Representative Davis, Log 1--Log 207r1 by Representative Waltz, Log 216r1 by Representative Waltz, Log 228 by Representative Crow, Log 229r2 by Representative Houlahan, Log 241r1 by Representative Brooks, Log 246r1 by Representative Hartzler, Log 251r1 by Representative Brooks, Log 255r1 by Representative Speier, Log 305r2 by Representative Slotkin, Log 312r3 by Representative Mitchell, Log 333r3 by Representative Mitchell, Log 373 by Representative Bergman, Log 380r1 by Representative Thornberry, Log 386 by Representative Khanna, Log 396r1 by Representative Courtney, Log 405r1 by Representative Courtney, Log 410r1 by Representative Courtney, Log 432 by Representative Khanna, Log 449r1 by Representative Davis, Log 459r3 by Representative Bacon, Log 470r1 by Representative DesJarlais, Log 478 by Representative Moulton, Log 489 by Representative DesJarlais, Log 491r3 by Representative Bacon, Log 501 by Representative Trahan, Log 503r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 505r3 by Representative Torres Small, Log 508r2 by Representative Torres Small, Log 525r3 by Representative Haaland, Log 537r1 by Representative Thornberry, Log 550 by Representative Houlahan, Log 557 by Representative Gallego, Log 559r1 by Representative Moulton, Log 569r3 by Representative Sherrill, Log 572r2 by Representative Sherrill, Log 589r1 by Representative Cooper, Log 594Rr1 by Representative Byrne, Log 627 by Representative Brown, Log 628 by Representative Sherrill, Log 39r1 by Representative Vela, Log 175r2 by Representative Waltz, Log 236 by Representative Speier, Log 543r2 by Representative Golden, Log 575r2 by Representative Lamberg--Lamborn, sorry, Log 213r1 by Representative Mitchell, Log 294r1 by Representative Brindisi--I keep turning the page and hoping that there will be an end, haven't gotten to it yet--Log 379r1 by Representative Thornberry, Log 585r1 by Representative Gallego, Log 38r2 by Representative Conaway, Log 144 by Representative Conaway, Log 306 by Representative Gallagher, Log 318r1 by Representative Banks, Log 578r2 by Representative Banks, Log 179r2 by Representative Waltz, Log 574r2 by Representative Banks, Log 284 by Representative Kim, Log 309r1 by Representative Slotkin, Log 590r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 507r1 by Representative Trahan, Log 257r2 by Representative Wittman, Log 360r3 by Representative Crow, Log 442r4 by Representative Kim, Log 2--Log 23r3 by Representative Bacon, Log 110 by Representative Killy--Kelly, Log 464r2 by Representative Bacon, Log 523 by Representative Courtney, Log 545 by Representative Kelly, Log 570r2 by Representative Moulton, Log 243r1 by Representative Brooks, Log 143r5 by Representative Lamborn, Log 149 by Representative Courtney, Log 276 by Representative Cheney, Log 283r1 by Representative Brindisi, Log 444r2 by Representative Houlahan, Log 499r3 by Representative Torres Small, Log 275 by Representative Crow, Log 304 by Representative Houlahan. 
Is there any discussion of the en bloc package? Well, actually, if there is no further discussion, the question is an adoption of en bloc package number one. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed no. The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. 
All right. We will now consider Log 63. I'm sorry. I did not get the new list here, or I didn't open the new list. I apologize. We will now consider Log 150 by Mr. Langevin. I'm sorry. For what purpose does Mr. Langevin seek recognition? 
LANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment, and Mr. Langevin is recognized to explain his amendment. 
LANGEVIN: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, my--my amendment would prohibit the deployment of warheads beyond the New START levels. I'm greatly concerned with the administration's reckless behavior with respect to arms control and our relations with Russia. 
Last year, the president left the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Early this year, he illegally left the Open Skies Treaty. Last year's NDAA, which he signed, explicitly called for congressional consultation and 20--120 days' notice ahead of a formal announcement, neither of which he provided. So, Mr. Chairman, Congress must step in and protect our last nonproliferation treaty with Russia, New START. So, we now live in a world with nine nuclear powers. More than negligent, I believe it is absolutely dangerous for the administration to continue wavering on nonproliferation commitments. 
Mr. Chairman, this amendment, though, also falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Relations. I certainly respect to the great leadership Chairman Engel has shown over the years on nonproliferation issues, and I've agreed to work with him as this bill moves to the floor. So, therefore, with that I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. Thank you and I yield back. 
SMITH: The gentleman withdraws the amendment. 
So, it is now in order to consider Log number 239. For what purpose does the gentlelady from California seek recognition? Well, that's not helpful. Mr. Gallego, are you prepared for your amendment? We're going to skip--we're going to skip the two amendments, so you ready? Okay. So, we'll now consider Log 453. And for what purpose does the gentleman from Arizona seek recognition? 
GALLEGO: Mr. Chairman, thank you. This amendment that I'm bringing with Mr. Bacon will protect-- 
SMITH: --Hey-- 
GALLEGO: --Our force posture-- 
SMITH: --Ruben? Ruben? Sorry. You--you have to offer--you--you have an amendment at the desk. 
GALLEGO: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with reading of the amendment, and now the gentleman is recognized to explain his amendment. 
GALLEGO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and--and my fellow members. Mr. Chairman, this amendment that I'm bringing with Mr. Bacon will protect our force posture in Germany and Europe. At this time, we can't afford to reduce our presence in Europe. Russia is a major threat to our country and to the free world. 
Our deterrence posture in Germany is a key reason that Russia no longer controls most of Eastern Europe. Our German bases have treated thousands of our service members who have been wounded in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Our airbases in Germany enable the rapid deployment of our troops around the world on almost no notice. And our force posture throughout Europe is designed and well placed to deter any Russian attack on NATO. 
We're still in the middle of our MILCON restoration and the European deterrence initiative, so I'm pleased that we have an infrastructure savings clause in here also. I want to thank Mr. Bacon for his support, and I urge a yes vote in favor of defending against Russian aggression and attacks. 
SMITH: Mr. Gaetz? 
GAETZ: I'd like to speak in opposition to the amendment. 
SMITH: Mr. Gaetz is recognized. 
GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to begin with a request enter into the record a New York Times piece from January 13th, 2012 entitled ""The U.S. faces new challenge of fewer troops in Europe."" I seek unanimous re--request for that--unanimous consent. 
SMITH: Hearing no objection, so ordered. 
GAETZ: And--and Mr. Chairman, the reason I would like this entered into the record is because it chronicles the Bush administration--the Bush-Cheney administration's efforts to withdraw elements of our troops from Germany. So, apparently the Bush-Cheney administration believed that this continued sustained level of troop presence in Germany was not necessary to achieve the deterrence objectives that was mentioned, but the sentiment continued. 
In fact, it was Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, whose--whose fine son serves with a--with us in the Congress, who also supported the reduction in these troop levels in Germany to levels that would even be consistent with what the Trump administration is looking at now. So, it seems to be that there is bipartisan support to reduce these troop levels. 
And what Mr. Gallego's amendment does is it forces--it ties the administration's hands. It says that no matter what the changing conditions are, the committee has taken the position that we must maintain our current level of involvement in Germany. I do not believe that our current presence in Germany is the reason why Russia no longer controls Eastern Europe. That was the argument the gentleman made, and I--I can't believe he was able to make it with a straight face. It's not as if our presence in Germany stopped Russia for marching into Crimea. They were able to do that despite our 35,000 troops in Germany. 
It's deeply disappointing that, when you have rub--Republicans and Democrats around the country seeking to put our--our nation first, seeking less U.S. involvement, that there seems to be tremendous bipartisan belief on the committee that we ought to be engaged everywhere at a tremendous high--tremendously high cost and with, I think, little impact on global affairs beyond the draining of our military, the overextension of our resources, and the limitation of our capabilities. 
If we do reduce our chirp--troop presence, I think that we could count on our European partners to step up. I think that the way they become stronger is by having to become stronger. I think that what we've seen in NATO has been helpful to the institution because more European nations are contributing a higher percentage of their GDP. And so, it's my sincere hope that the amendment will not be adopted, and I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Bacon is recognized. 
BACON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support the amendment, obviously. I served in NATO for three years. The Russian threat is growing. It's not declining. And I think a key facet here is we've already reduced our NATO forces by two-thirds since 1990 until today. I think our--a one-third presence is necessary, and we cannot--we can't afford to go less. In fact, I would--I would favor more. 
Also, when you look at what--what forces do we have in Germany right now? Well, the Army has no combat troops. They strictly have logistics forces there to take in more troops in case hostilities arise with Russia. So, by cutting ground forces, you're actually cutting your ability to--to receive more ground forces in a time of conflict. 
In regards the Air Force, we have two bases that are most--two of the most strategic bases in that whole part of the world, Spangdahlem and Ramstein. They're not only critical for what we do in Europe, they're absolutely critical to what we do in the Middle East and Africa. They're in the perfect location to take C-5s and C-17s without air refueling, then get gas, and then do--their next landing be in the Middle East, Iraq, or Afghanistan, or in Africa. So, in other words, it's in the perfect location to support three different continents worth of operations. 
So, if you're going to cut 9,000 troops, you're either cutting logistics forces with the Army, which hurts us for deterrence, it hurts us to put ground forces back in in a time of conflict, or you're cutting one of these airbases that are strategic in supporting three different COCOMs that--that are heavily involved today. 
Now, I do agree the president on this. Germany only is paying about 1.1 percent of their GDP to defense. I do think that we need to continue diplomatically putting pressure on our friends to do more. But we have to also realize they do things that aren't included in that 1.1 percent, like do much of the funding to support those two--two--those two airfields. 
So, bottom line is I think this weakens NATO. This weakens us against Russia. We've already reduced our forces by two-thirds. This will hurt our ability to respond in a time of conflict in the future. So, I think we have to keep our presence where it's at in Germany. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for giving me a chance to speak. I yield. 
SMITH: Mr. Garamendi? 
GARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gaetz makes a very interesting argument that ignores the fact from--the things that have happened between the Bush-Cheney administration and today, little things like Georgia, Crimea, Ukraine. I'd like to yield the rest of my time to Mr. Gallego. 
GALLEGO: Yes. Thank you, Representative Garamendi. Thank you, Representative Gaetz also for engaging in this debate in such a civil manner. I think we should always recognize when that happens. 
One of the things I'd like to point out, you know, and I think there are--there are legitimate concerns in terms of, you know, us cementing troop levels in different parts of the world. One thing that you should at least observe is that, in this amendment that Bacon and I are introducing, this amendment ends automatically unless we decide to somehow come back on the date of, I believe, October 31st of--oh, sorry, December 31st of 2021. 
And so, what I'd point out to you, Mr. Gaetz, is that this is not something that we're going to say is always going to happen. This just gives us an opportunity to--us as Armed Services Committee, to really be able to reevaluate in, you know, a proper amount of time what our force posture should be in Eastern Europe. And I agree to certain degrees that we may have to bring some troops back. We may have to rotate some troops closer to the Eastern front. But let's do that in a manner where we could all plan it, where we can all agree, and not in, I think, a hasty manner that create some doubt among our alliances. Thank you. I yield back my time. 
SMITH: Thank you. 
One quick note as we're dealing with this third vote, then there'll be a little bit of a gap there, in a few amendments we will have some amendments that face second degree amendments. And just for everyone's memory, if a second degree amendment comes up, we have to vote on it right then, not at the end of the process. So, just for your planning purposes, keep your eyes out for second degree amendments, as we will have to have roll call votes at that point, not at the end of the process. 
And with that programming note-- 
THORNBERRY: --Mr. Chairman-- 
SMITH: --I will recognize Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I support the Gallego amendment. I think it's well done. I fully agree that every NATO ally needs to meet their 2 percent commitment. But I was very concerned by the proposals that floated from apparently a couple people in the White House that not only would we bring a--a lot of troops out of Germany, but we would put troop caps on how many Americans could ever be in the country at any one particular time. And the effect of that would mean we couldn't do exercises. And as General Bacon pointed out, we also couldn't use Germany as a transit point for going to other theaters, whether it's the Middle East or Africa. 
It--it--it was not done--this proposal was not put together with the input or consideration of the Department of Defense. And so, the way I read the Gallego amendment is this says--this is not say you can't move people out of Germany or Europe. It says you gotta to study it and you gotta consult with your allies and you gotta figure out what the effects are going to be. 
Now, I don't think that's too much to ask, especially since we've had some proposals that did not meet that criteria. So, I think this is the right thing to do. I think it is imperative that, whatever we do, we consult with our allies, work with them, but we also don't cut off our nose to spite our face. 
SMITH: Mr. Brooks? 
BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a little bit different view, although I respect those differing views. Quite frankly, the United States of America has been defending Europe for seven decades. The result of that defense of Europe by the United States of America forces is that Europe has become dependent on the United States of America for its defense and has not built up their own military capacity in order to defend themselves. 
I would submit that if we, the United States of America, gradually reduce our forces in Europe, that in turn causes Europe to start building up their own military forces, which in turn means that we collectively, the United States of America's military forces and the strengthened European forces, are in a stronger and better position to defend Europe and other parts of the world in which the United States of America and NATO have an interest. And so, as a result I am going to oppose this amendment because I believe that a stronger Europe made up of a stronger European military is better for our alliance. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Khanna. Mr. Khanna, are you with us? 
KHANNA: Yes, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? 
SMITH: We got you loud and clear. Go ahead. 
KHANNA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am supportive of Representative Gaetz's objection to this amendment. The reality is progressives have always been for the rational reduction of troops abroad to prevent further engagement in the Middle East and to bring that money home so we can spend it on jobs in our country, infrastructure in our country. President Obama in 2012, as you know, Mr. Chairman, recommended a 7,000 reduction of troops from Europe. That was President Obama's policy. 
Now, of course everyone on this committee is opposed to Russian aggression, but the reality is that 34,000 troops didn't stop them from marching into Crimea. The way to stop Russian aggression is not going to be determined with whether we have 5,000, 9,000 more troops sitting there in Germany. If 34,000 couldn't stop them, I doubt 25,000 is going to be a deterrent in stopping them. What we need is a strengthening of our alliances, a clear sense to--to Russia about--through effective diplomacy that we are not going to stand for further aggression and interference in our elections. 
But that should not be a--a knee-jerk reaction, to--to not reduce troop levels and bring troop levels home and adjust to the 21st century. I mean, we can't be relitigating the 20th century wars in the 21st century. So, I don't support--as people here know, I've been one of the loudest critics of the president. I don't support the idea of retaliating against Germany. 
But I don't think it--it--just because the White House proposes something, and progressives are--have always been for troop reduction, that we say, well, now we're not--no longer for troop reduction. I think we ought to have a thoughtful, rational conversation about how we bring some of these troops home, and I welcome that debate. I can't support an amendment that--that restricts that debate. 
SMITH: Thank you. I have--just for members' information, I have Mr. Turner, Mr. Crow, and Mr. Cook. If there's somebody else who wishes to speak, let--let me or the staff know. I've got Mr. Bishop. Mr. Turner, you're up. 
TURNER: I want to speak in favor the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate Mr. Bacon's statements of the importance of the troops that are in Germany, and I--I really appreciate Mr. Gaetz' statement that these troops are insufficient and no longer needed to protect Germany, because they're not there to protect Germany. 
I--I've served as the president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and Garamendi, Mr. Cook, Mr. Lamborn, Mr. Bishop, Mr. Larsen, Mr. Wilson, on a bipartisan basis, have served in the--in the--and Susan Davis, who I promised would have--have no significant work who had to do great leadership there, had--are active and working with our fellow parliamentarians of our NATO partners. I know, as Mr. Gaetz knows, that all of us on this committee are in and out of Germany and in and out of the bases in Germany, and that's not what our troops do in Germany. 
Our troops in Germany coordinate all of our stuff all around the world, our--our nuclear deterrent, our--as the chairman--as Mr. Thornberry was saying, the forward deployment, our logistics. What we have in Germany is not to defend Germany. Now, this--and--and to--to--all deference to Mr. Khanna, whether or not this passes, these troops aren't coming home. This is not about, oh, we're going to go reduce troops. 
You know, the president, in raising this issue--and I think he rightly raised the issue with Germany. Germany needs to carry its weight. It needs to pay its 2 percent. It needs to be an active member of--of NATO and it currently is not. And I think his words are absolutely important in engaging Germany and our NATO allies. 
This amendment does not thwart the president doing that. It says that we need to look to the military goals and objectives, and I think that's what's important about what we have in Germany, and I think it aids the discussion with Germany on how they need to increase their participation and what they need to do in response to the president. 
I would encourage everyone to vote for this. Our--our allies every day ask the question is America still with us? And voting for this and saying we're going to do an assessment of the military needs is--is absolutely appropriate. 
Now, I wish the president incredibly well in his negotiations with Germany on increasing their participation, on support of the United States, on having a deployable military. All of NATO is continuing that pressure upon Germany. But taking our vital operations that are--are vital to us and--and diminishing them does not increase our security or the security of our allies. So, I would encourage everyone to support this amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. I will recognize myself for a couple of minutes. And it's a weird day. I--I really wanted to just make the point that Mr. Turner made just--just a minute ago, and that is that our troops are not in Germany to protect Europe; major misunderstanding on that. They are there for the purpose that Mr. Turner pointed out, to be forward deployed and coordinate our global efforts. And that's the main reason now that we have troops based outside of the U.S. 
If we're dealing with a--a terrorist threat in Africa or the Middle East, having troops forward deployed on the other side of the world puts us in a better position to deal with those threats, even outside of Europe. But also having those troops over there puts us in a position to build relationships with allies and--and build strategic partnerships also to confront our national security threats so that hopefully we don't have to send, you know, a million troops into Europe to defend it, that we've rebuilt a system of alliances across the con--the world, sorry, that enable us to meet our national security needs. 
And, you know, that--that's what worries me about the president's approach. Certainly, redeploying troops makes sense. I--I'm worried about his stated hostility to alliances. And I'm worried even about the way he announced the idea of pulling the troops out of Germany was, once again, demonstrating his hostility towards that alliance, the belief that Germany wasn't a good partner so we should pull out to punish them. I think that is the wrong approach. I think alliances are crucial to our national security. 
Now, that--none of that is to say that we shouldn't potentially pull troops out of Germany. I think it's--it's--it's worth examining and talking about, and that's what Mr. Gallego's amendment says. So, I do realize that the Democrats traditionally have talked about all of our troops forward deployed, and I agree with the sentiment that our foreign policy over the course of the last 60 or 70 years has been too military focused, that we need to look at other tools in our national security and foreign policy toolbox. Diplomacy, aid, partnerships, alliances, all of that is more important than sending in the military. 
But focusing on pulling troops back from the rest of the world, to my mind, achieves the opposite goal. It's mostly advocated by people who feel like our military is playing too great of a role in the world. But part of what our military does is builds those alliances and makes sure that we--we don't have to actually use the military. And all of those things should be thought about before we announce that we're going to yank 10,000 troops out of Germany. 
And by the way, the president has not yet been clear on exactly what he's doing here, because on the one hand we've heard from people who say we want to bring them back. But again, as I--I think it was Mr. Turner who made the point, they're not--they're not coming back necessarily. There has been talk in the administration about, well, they should go to Poland or Romania or Bulgaria. I don't think we should be sort of like spit balling publicly about what we want to do on this. I think we should have a cohesive plan and decide what our force posture should be, and I think Mr. Gallego's a minion--amendment appropriately puts us in a place to do that. 
With that, I will do two things. One, I recognize Mr. Crow and, two, Mr. Larsen. I've always wanted to say this. You have the comm. I'm going to go vote, so you're in charge. And we've got--we've got Crow, Cook, and Bishop. And anyone else who wants to be recognized, let Mr. Larsen know. 
LARSEN: I will say I've never wanted to hear that. 
SMITH: Yeah. I never really wanted to say it either, now that I stop to think about it, but here we are. Mr. Crow, you're recognized. 
CROW: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You--you made several of the remarks that I was going to make. I couldn't agree more with you that the transatlantic partnership, for over 70 years, has ushered in a--an era of peace and pros--prosperity and stability between North America and Europe the likes of which we have never seen before. That's not to say that we haven't had conflict, but that partnership is real, it's tangible, and it benefits both sides. This is not a one-sided affair. This is very much in the interest of the United States and the rest of the world, to maintain that. 
This also--the--the notion of just pulling troops back couldn't come at a worse time. Talking to our NATO partners, our allies, there is very real concern about our commitment to that partnership that has endured, again, for over 70 decades--or seven decades. Doing this without consultation, without a process sends a message that we are not committed and that we do not have a resolve to that alliance. 
And I am also in favor of making sure that we hold our NATO partners accountable for meeting their obligations in their defense spending and that they pull their fair share. However, our alliance with them is not transactional. It never has been. It is not based on columns in a balance sheet. It's based on shared values. It's based on shared interests. And we shouldn't have that relationship contingent on dollar amounts. It's contingent on our shared interests and our values. 
Secondly, the process here was fundamentally fall--flawed. When the Secretary of the Army, who oversees the--the bulk of those troops, actually learns about the president's decision while reading the Wall Street Journal, we know that the normal process, the interagency process that is supposed to be followed, the deliberation and the consultation that's required to make sensible, smart decisions did not occur. I'm perfectly willing to have that discussion, but let's have it in the right way. 
And lastly, as many of my colleagues pointed out, this is not just about Germany. This is about our--our ability to meet obligations throughout the entire world. Germany, indeed, is a hub, a transit hub for our operations in the Middle East and Africa and Europe and throughout Europe--Northern Europe, and a pull down in Germany would drastically affect our ability to count all--conduct all those operations, and that is a discussion worth having in a systematic and deliberate way. That's why I will be supporting Mr. Gallego's amendment. I yield back. 
LARSEN: Thank you. The chair recognizes Mr. Bishop for five minutes. 
BISHOP: Thank you, Mr. Larsen. Look, I want to add my voice to a lot of those things that have been said here as well, primarily because I was reading a magazine the other day, which simply talked about what is happening in Europe is no longer what it used to be like. So, when I was actually spending a couple of--living over there. We're always talking about it was the American tanks that were stopping there to prohibit the Russian tanks from rushing through the folded gap, and the article said well that no longer exists, therefore we should make significant changes. 
I think we are being naive, though, if we think that that has really significantly changed and our presence doesn't make some deterrence in the situation, because at that time when I was over there, the American presence stopped at the Iron Curtain. Today, it goes far beyond that and if you look at where the map is right now, especially of the defense of Europe, it becomes significant because they're now the three Baltic states who are very strong allies of ours and Poland that is a very strong ally of ours and right smack dab in the middle of all of those is Kaliningrad, which is still Russian territory from which any kind of Russian initiative could easily be launched and the United States does have a significant problem because of the geography that is now there. 
We cannot take that for granted. We cannot--we cannot simplify the significance of what is actually over there and then have to ask ourselves the question, if the United States were to make unilateral and precipitous decisions. Would that actually have a tendency of encouraging Russian aggression or would it discourage Russian aggression? And, I think the encouraging is actually what would, indeed, take place, which is why we should take a very careful and sophisticated look at it through that particular way. 
I--I also realize, as plenty of people are saying, we have some issues in which we must discuss with the Germans, what indeed should and should not be included in their 2 percent. Are they including non-military stuff in their 2 percent? We should ask them about the Nord Stream pipeline. 
But, all of that, as significant and logistic--and legitimate as those discussions are, it really has nothing to do with the issue at hand here on whether we study this or whether we move precipitously. I'd also like to remind us, remind all of us who are here, that our words are being listened to by the other members of the alliance in Europe and these are not just idle words we're throwing out here. They do have significance in the way we are perceived and the way the future of the alliance will actually be perceived. 
And, I'll just add one last thing. In my time in Germany, I found out that if you go to the areas which are most pro-American, which seem to have the greatest amount of popular support for us, it's the areas where the American servicemen served and still are serving. That is where people understand over in Europe exactly what America means and they have an extremely positive attitude. 
So, what I want us to do is not make this a simplistic idea. Is this still a continuation of the Cold War? No. But, the situation in Europe is still as tenuous as it was, but it's different, and that our position still should be is--as significant as it was and how we respond and how we act does make a difference in the alliance, does make a difference in how we are--how we will respond, and it does make a difference in how the--how the old Soviet Union, now called Russia, will respond. 
So, with that, I ask extreme caution and am support of the amendment, the original amendment, but making sure that we don't go overboard in--in a simplistic reaction to what it has said. And, with that, Mr. Larsen, I--I yield back. 
LARSEN: Thank you, Congressman Bishop. Representative Cook is recognized for five minutes. 
COOK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I strongly support the Gallego amendment. If people haven't talked to Gerry Connolly, he was--he was over at the last NATO conference. In fact, this makes I think almost eight years that I've been going to the NATO conference. 
It was shocking this year, very, very shocking, because two countries in particular--and I'll--I'll call them out. It was France and Italy and they're talking about backing out of NATO back then and having the European Union have its own military protective force. It's almost the script that Putin had written for them. 
Very, very, very scary. Now, I've been over there three times, military exercised a long time ago. I've been over obviously for a lot of them and Germany is, without a doubt, particularly for the Army but also the Marine Corps, it has the best training area in the world. You can do things at (INAUDIBLE) which is one of the--the bases over there. You can fire the main gun on the modern tank. You can't even do that in the United States anymore. 
Some of the training that you have there for the strikers and everything else, it's like we have to go all the way over there and they are fantastic, at least in my opinion. This is very, very scary, what's--what's happening, because France right now is trying to split NATO and don't forget, France has never been a big NATO supporter. Check your history. A guy by the name of Charles de Gaulle, how they were going to bail on that and maybe some people forgot 6 June 1944 when how many Americans and Brits stormed the beaches at Normandy there. 
Extremely important, you know, a number of people have mentioned the--the situation. If you haven't read that RAND report a few years ago with the Russian reaction and how- in basically three days, they could accomplish all their objectives. But, now something even worse, and that is this--this organization which is now up to 29 countries, including many former Russian satellites, Warsaw Pact nations, is part of NATO and we have open dialogues and everything like that. 
And, to hear that we're going to turn our back--the Germans have been a little slow in paying and everything, but they are still probably the best trained of any of the armies over there. They have always been with us and I--I think this dialogue sends the wrong message to our European allies. It's--this is exactly what the Russians want and we are giving it to them, ""Oh, we're going to cut our savings,"" and blah blah blah blah. 
Go over and see a NATO exercise. Go over there and go to (INAUDIBLE). Go over there--I see John Garamendi because he--we've gone on a few (INAUDIBLE) there. I had to bail him out of a jail in Germany. 
But, I strongly, strongly support Mr. Gallego's amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: We do not intend to ask. Does anyone else seek recognition on this amendment? All right. Hearing no comments on the amendment itself, all--all those in favor of the amendment offered by Mr. Gallego will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: And, the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it. 
UNKNOWN: Mr. Chairman, a recorded vote. 
SMITH: A recorded vote is requested. We will suspend proceedings on this until the end of the mark, when we roll all of the votes. 
It is now in order to consider Log number 329r1. For what purpose does the gentleman from Indiana seek recognition? 
BANKS: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: The clerk will distribute the amendment. I'm sorry, I've got to get to the right page here. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes to discuss his amendment. Mr. Banks. 
BANKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment would fill a loophole that was created in last year's NDAA that exempted defense funded basic research activities from information sharing requirements. This is a necessary step to ensure the security of our sensitive defense research and development. 
This is not about undoing the foundations of open and free academic research. This is about transparency and accountability. These are taxpayer dollars and the DOD must have the ability to understand where this money is going and who is participating in this research, whether they are American or foreign. 
We have seen numerous incidents from both Americans and foreign nationals involved in the theft of intellectual property espionage and illicit technology transfer. It is exceedingly difficult for the department to accurately assess what vulnerabilities exist within these DOD research programs if they aren't aware of who is actually conducting the research. 
The Department of Defense trusts these universities to explore and develop critical military capabilities and national security challenges. The majority might say that basic research is just science and doesn't have implications on the development of military capabilities. 
But, let me take a moment to highlight just a few examples of what ""basic research"" grants really are, including Russian disinformation and propaganda campaigns, also nanoparticles that can take down unmanned aerial systems, also quantum communications that represent the next level of secure communications, to name just a few of the examples of what these research projects look like. 
I would call these critical defense capabilities and I imagine most of you would as well, yet the department knows more about the tourists that visit the Pentagon or work at the Starbucks on any military installation than they do about who participates in these research projects. This is about accountability, this is about security and this is about our national and economic security and I ask that all of you will please support this important amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Larsen. 
LARSEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and while I respect Representative Banks's position on this and--and many other things, including a report that we--we accepted (INAUDIBLE) about the Department of Defense involvement and embassy China working groups and folks also know that in the IETC en bloc amendment today, that we considered and adopted, we included and adopted Log 19 and Log 485, two very important amendments that get at some of the heart of the relationship and scientific relationship that--and concerns that we have with--with China and with Russia as it stands as well. 
So, we've already taken some pretty key and important votes to push back on I think the broad issue that we're all concerned about, and that is China and IP--IP theft. So, the--the mark already includes these additional requirements and these are important and we should take pride in supporting those. 
But, Mr. Banks's amendment would, though, further expand the individuals on whom the Department of Defense collects data to include people involved in basic research. Now, the U.S. has the best talent acquisition program for the last 70 years because of open basic research done at American universities. 
All basic research is already published and widely shared. It's already transparent. Anybody can get their hands on it because it's published and widely shared. So, the data that these foreign students and these U.S. citizens have access to does not put national security knowledge at risk. 
Now, many foreign students have come to the U.S. to study at American universities and have gone to do great work in the United States, and I would recommend to every member of this committee to contact these research universities in your own state to find out who these folks are, get their names and look at the work they've done. 
Fredrik Ryden from Sweden has a University of Washington Ph.D. in electrical engineering who leads Olis Robotics in Seattle and the company has brought in significant federal and private investment. Ye Fon Sum (SP) from China is one of the founders of cyber biotechnology and helped engineer the Rosetta software, which is named one of the top scientific breakthroughs of 2016. CJ Wong from Taiwan graduated from the University of Washington in 1966. I know I'm going back a long way. I was one year old. I didn't know him. But, he pioneered advancements in semiconductor lasers of fiber optic communications decades before the technology is fully understood. 
George Huang from Taiwan is the founder of FutureDial, a secondary cell phone marketplace provider. He has a Ph.D. from the University of Washington and--and a master's from Washington State University. And, Sal Dhanani from India is a founder and CTO of Telenav, the navigation solution provider for automated connected care platform from smart navigation semiautonomous sensor and AI road information and a Bachelor's in [sic] Science degree from the University of Washington. 
The world's brightest students attend our universities to pursue an education. They participate in basic research that is open, that is transparent, and that is published. This amendment closes that off. There are a lot of good reasons why we should be tougher on American universities in terms of not being transparent enough, not being open enough when it comes to sensitive research, and we've had this discussion. We need to continue to have that discussion with universities so they improve their own internal controls. 
But, this is about cutting off access to basic research from some of the folks who will prove to be some of the finest minds in the world and having that opportunity to study at our universities here in the United States. So, I am recommending that we oppose this particular amendment and I yield back the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Conaway. 
CONAWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have much respect for the gentleman from Washington State. However, most of the folks he talked about came to this country, took advantage of those educational opportunities before Xi Jinping and the Communist Party shanghaied the entire nation of China. 
And, they are after our crown jewels and I don't know if it starts with basic research or it starts with high end, but to not protect ourselves from the announced intent of Xi Jinping in this regard is, in my--in my opinion, foolhardy. So, you know, I understand both sides of the argument. I don't know the necessary intricacies of what you're saying, but for us to unilaterally continue to disarm in the face of Chinese aggression going after all of our folks and even someone of Chinese descent, according to Xi Jinping, is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party for whatever they've developed here in the United States. 
And, so I support the gentleman's agreement--amendment and I yield back. Thank you. 
SMITH: Ms. Houlahan. 
HOULAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to speak in opposition to this amendment. I'm an engineer by training and a very big believer in basic scientific research that happens at our colleges and universities. 
In my home state of Pennsylvania, we have a number of universities that are on the cutting edge of both basic and applied research that helps our defense industrial base and I very much appreciate that Mr. Banks is concerned about the possibility that our near (INAUDIBLE) competitors, especially China, are eager to steal our nation's intellectual property and use it for their own national security advancement. 
We should absolutely know who works and has access to DOD research. In fact, working with some of our Pennsylvania universities, I've been supportive of a bipartisan effort to improve information sharing between DOD and our universities so that the latter can understand and take action on foreign intelligence threats. 
This amendment, however, would allow DOD to start tracking both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals engaged in basic research, not applied research which can be nationally secure--nationally security sensitive, but basic research, which is by its very nature for the public good and widely publicly available. 
I am concerned that this amendment would add an enormous administrative burden for both the DOD, pulling resources away from identifying and addressing foreign intelligence threats to our most sensitive research and development, and for our universities. I will be the first to say that we need to aggressively develop STEM talent here in our United States, but the fact remains that there is a global competition for the talent needed to address future capabilities and threats. 
Let's not make U.S. universities long the world's leader in this type of research inhospitable to basic researches--researchers, both American and foreign nationals. I yield back and thank you. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Rogers. 
ROGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I strongly support this amendment. Sensitive research in American universities has long been targeted by our strategic competitors. This committee has already taken steps to protect applied defense technology research, but we must now act to protect basic research defense applications. 
We can preserve the free and open academic system that has made America the global technological center while also acknowledging that China is trying to exploit American research at every level. Again, I strongly support this amendment and urge its adoption. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Ms. Sherrill. 
SHERRILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is something we've looked closely at in the Science, Space and Technology Committee as well. Our nation's tradition of welcoming international scholars makes our universities some of the best places to study, conduct research, and contribute discoveries that fuel jobs and economic growths. In fact, my own state of New Jersey has more scientists and engineers per square mile than anywhere in the world. Innovators, such as Alexander Graham Bell and Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein sought the U.S. for its opportunities, freedoms, and welcoming attitude. 
So, while I take concerns about inappropriate foreign influence and research seriously, I believe that openness, the free exchange of ideas, and the ability to continue to attract top talent from around the world are essential not just for our universities' research enterprise, but for our country's continued ability to be the world's leader in innovation and knowledge creation. 
Over the past ten years, more than half, 7 out of 11, of the Nobel Prize recipients from Princeton University were born in other countries. More broadly, immigrants have been awarded nearly 40 percent of the Nobel Prizes won by Americans in chemistry, medicine, and physics since 2000. 
The American Physical Society, a membership organization of academics and students engaged in physics research, conducted a survey in 2019 to evaluate international student applications to U.S. physics departments. I'm going to largely quote from the results of that study published by APS. 
While there's a small group of top-tier institutions that are insulated from any sustained decline in international student applications, outside of this top tier, physics departments across the U.S. have suffered an average two year decline in international applications of 22 percent. This substantial gap is now opening between top tier universities and all others and their ability to attract international students. 
That means we are even further concentrating research and innovation capacity in and around a few institutions. However, institutions outside of the top tier play essential roles in training the U.S. STEM workforce and in U.S. innovation. More than 70 percent of all U.S. physics PhDs are from institutions outside the top 15 and since 1996, Nobel laureates in physics received PhDs from institutions outside the top 15. Unfortunately, because of the decreased foreign student enrollment over the last few years, many institutions now face destabilizing declines and are making significant changes to adapt, including lowering standards. 
I don't want my remarks to be misunderstood. We must double down on our efforts to improve our K-12 STEM pipeline and ensure that every American student who wants to has the opportunity to pursue advanced STEM degrees. We have so much talent in our own nation that we fail to tap into, but we will continue to benefit from the best talent from around the world and for now, we rely heavily on them. This is not an either or. 
So, the important question is, why are international applications decreasing so precipitously? And, a survey asked that question too. Of those students who aren't even trying to come to the U.S., 32 percent report that they believe the U.S. is ""unwelcoming to foreigners."" Twenty percent believe they have better long-term employment opportunities outside the U.S. 
So, I encourage my colleagues to look at the full survey results and come to terms with the consequences. U.S. physics departments are already losing their global attraction. Our competitors are increasingly attracting global talent to their benefit and to our detriment. 
The amendment being offered today would only exacerbate this worrisome trend and put us on a path to becoming a second tier nation for research and innovation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Gaetz. 
GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I strongly support the gentleman from Indiana's amendment for the reasons articulated by Mr. Conaway. There is a story we tell ourselves about China, that they're just like us, that if we trade with them more, if we invite them to our academic institutions, that they will embrace liberal, Western democracy and jettison their authoritarian impulses. 
The truth is nothing could be further from--from reality. What we see in China is a dedicated strategy to target our academic institutions, to flood them with cash and then to try to extract talent that they can use in a way that puts the United States in a diminished position. 
We know this from countless reports. We know it from the information that we receive as members of this committee and certainly Mr. Conaway has unique experience getting this information through his role on the Intelligence Committee. 
I would suspect that if there are concerns about particular types of research being necessary for the public good, that Mr. Banks's amendment allows for that so long as DOD is--is guaranteed that this is not something that would jeopardize our national security. And, I would yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Indiana to respond to any comments you--you would choose to. 
BANKS: I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let--let's not fool ourselves. Basic university research funded by the Department of Defense or our intelligence agencies has a significant national security impact. 
If taxpayer dollars are going to fund this research and the research is for national security purposes, should we not know who is involved in that research? And, right now, the--right now, we don't. It's not reported to the Pentagon. 
The most astonishing committee--committee hearing I've ever been a part of was an IETC hearing with university research officials and Pentagon officials, where I heard exactly that. They don't track who is involved and they don't report it to the Pentagon. 
This amendment doesn't prevent any college student from participating in university research, but it does require that basic university research funded by the Department of Defense for national security purposes would--would track and report who's involved in that research. 
Mr. Larsen read--who I respect greatly--read many names of--of researchers on a--on a college campus in Washington. If he has a list of those names, shouldn't the Pentagon have a list of those names as well and track who's involved in that research? And, if this--if these research projects are transparent and made public in the way that they are, then what's the resistance to knowing who's involved in those projects? Thank you. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Moulton. 
MOULTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this is a--I think this is a tough call and I am concerned about how this debate is falling along partisan lines, because we do live in a different age with the stated policy of China and Xi Jinping to steal our basic scientific research that does have an influence on our national security. 
At the same time, I come from Massachusetts. I have a degree in Physics from Harvard. I represent a part of the world with the greatest concentration of top universities and yet it was a Harvard chemistry professor who was recently charged by the U.S. attorney for undue influence from China. And, it's pretty clear that we didn't have any oversight over that. 
So, I'm very concerned about any restrictions to freedom of thought, to basic scientific research. But, if this is just oversight for DOD dollars, we're paying these--these researchers to do research that is in fact important for national security by definition. That's why DOD is paying for it. Then, I'm not sure it should be such a great concern. 
One of the things we've learned on our Future of Defense Taskforce is that there are a lot of areas that are just considered basic scientific research now, such as biotech, that have huge implications for the future of national security. So, we've got to strike this balance right. 
I'm not convinced how I'll vote on this amendment, but Mr. Banks, I'm wondering if you can just answer some of these questions about how your amendment will protect us while also ensuring that people still want to come to the United States, that this is still the premier place in the world to conduct basic scientific research and how academic freedom, an essential part of our democracy, baked into our Constitution will be preserved. I yield. 
BANKS: I thank the gentleman for yielding. It's been a--by the way, the honor of my service and Congress to co-chair the Future of Defense Taskforce with you. Mr. Moulton, we've learned so much about the threat over the six months of--of that endeavor. By the way, it's interesting that so many of us have jumped to the conclusion that this is about Chinese students. This could--this could be students from any adversarial country that comes to the United States and participates in university research. 
My amendment doesn't prevent any student from being involved in the research. It just requires that those who are involved in that research would be reported to the Department of Defense, especially considering that this research is funded by the Department of Defense to begin with. So, that's all this amendment does. 
I mean, Mr. Moulton, you make--you make a compelling point. This is--what we're doing today with this National Defense Authorization Act, this is a--this is a primary role of us as members of Congress as an oversight function and this is--that's exactly what this amendment does in providing oversight for taxpayer dollars to go to fund research on college campuses to report students involved and the background of that research to the Pentagon, which does not happen today for basic research. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Mitchell. 
MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let me ask folks to think about some basic concepts. We're talking about oversight. We're talking about information necessary to have oversight on funding the DOD is putting into basic research, so we know who's doing the research, so we know if they're students from an adversarial country, if they're participating in DOD funded research. I thought that was our role here was to be able to have that kind of oversight. So, I'm a little confused that now we're saying that somehow that's going to restrain or limit foreign students from participating in basic research at universities in America. 
We've had ample instances we've seen of violations from the reported requirements as they exist by the Chinese. Is there anybody in this room that does not believe that China is an adversary of the United States? There's every plan possible to become a world power at our detriment. Is there anybody that doesn't believe that? 
I had the opportunity to serve with Mr. Banks and Mr. Moulton on the Future of Defense Taskforce. It was very enlightening. It was enlightening because basic research such as gene mapping and how important that is--important that is in the future is a very basic research following gene--or gene printing, I'm sorry--following gene mapping. 
There are two primary competitors in the world on that: the United States and China. Who do you want to control that in the future, at least be able to be on the map with it? Do you want that primarily controlled and managed by China? Do you want to be holding for China for that basic research? 
Anybody in this room had an Impossible Burger? If you have, by the way, yeah believe it or not, gene printing produced the ability to produce a burger that tastes like meat and it's not. Basic as that. It's very high tech things, like working in manufacturing in agriculture, and they compete with the Chinese. We've seen China--we hoped through the WTO, they would come and act like the rest of the world or in some manner. 
Did that work? We've seen what they're doing in Hong Kong. They made an arrangement. Is that working? Had they failed to live up to what they committed to regarding Hong Kong? They've clearly violated our laws on numerous occasions regarding reporting of the funding they put in universities. It's somehow a basic requirement that reporting, if you have Chinese students, Chinese nationals participating in basic research, somehow should offend them or us. 
Let us not be naive about this. We need to know if adversarial nations have individuals participating in basic research. I don't understand why that's some shock. So, I would--please, let's--we've got a lot to do and we've got things and move on. Let's just--let's just put this forward. It's not the end of the world and let's deal with stuff that's more important. This is not one of those things we should have fight about, as Mr. Moulton indicated, on a partisan basis. I yield back. Thanks, chair. 
SMITH: Thank you. Ms. Speier. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I represent one of the biggest biotech districts in the country. Between biotech and high tech and the like, any number of my companies are represented by foreign borne CEOs. Having said that, I also serve on the Intelligence Committee and I would suggest to everyone that we have reason to support this amendment. 
And, I would suggest further that if you look at, for instance, Chinese students, a third of the university students in this country come from China. We have a very open society. China uses LinkedIn to lure U.S. professors and members of various defense contractors to come to China to provide opportunities for them to give speeches and you can go from there. 
So, I don't think this is malignant. I think that it is in fact something that we should recognize is very important for us to know about since it is DOD money on intelligence issues and is basic research. So, I will support the amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Ms. Davis. 
DAVIS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think, you know, this has been interesting because I think I certainly started in one place on it. But, I wanted to--to understand sort of what the guardrails are in--in your--your proposal, Mr. Banks. You know, what is it that we're looking for and what restraints or what, you know, more nefarious kinds of activities could occur around this, which we would not want to have happen to our scientists and I'm--you know, probably truth for any other country. Could you respond to that? 
BANKS: Yeah. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Maybe we're making much more out of this than what it is. My amendment last year to the NDAA dealt with--we're talking about definitions that dealt with applied research on college campuses. This amendment--and sort of, it--in my opening remarks, I talked about a loophole because now--now we better understand that that--what that didn't include last year is basic university research. 
So, I read a few examples. I want to--I want to read one. So many of us jump to the--the--the Chinese student conclusion and that's--and that's serious, but another example would be--another example of basic university research that I'm talking about that's funded by the Department of Defense, this is a real example, Russian disinformation and propaganda campaigns. 
So, that--what I would submit to you is how--how do we know that a Russian student participated in a DOD funded national security interest related university research project about Russian disinformation and propaganda campaigns? Right now, we don't know that and all my amendment would do was force--would be to force the Pentagon, if you use our taxpayer dollars and give it to university for--for national security related research, basic research like this example, then the--then the Pentagon should create a database and collect which students are involved in that research. 
That's all this amendment does and it's something that I'm--I've had a hard time wrapping my head around that we--why we don't already do that. 
DAVIS: I think my concern would be--I take back my time--is that I don't know that you find that out in a simple way. Do you ask them, ""Are you doing this kind of research?"" I just think that it might--in order to--in order to be able to implement this, you might be asking people to do something that certainly even for a student in our country, is not appropriate. 
And, that's--I'm just--I don't know what those guardrails would be or whether this is an appropriate time to write them in, but I'm just wondering where it takes us and that's--that's the slippery slope that this kind of thing can do. 
SMITH: This has been a good debate. It's been a long debate. If someone has something else quick, I think it's been well aired. Are there any further comments? 
Hearing none, all those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. 
It is now in order to consider Log number 533. For what purpose does the gentleman from Alabama seek recognition? 
ROGERS: Mr. Chairman, I call up my amendment, Log 528, and ask for its consideration. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. The gentleman is recognized to discuss his amendment. 
ROGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We all know our broken immigration system continues to incentivize illegal activity and put vulnerable populations at risk. Cartels lure desperate people using fake promises, even telling them that they can use children as a form of visa. 
Congress has repeatedly refused to do its job and invest in securing our borders. This came to a head last year. HHS and CBP broke all-time records for unaccompanied children in their care. Money for housing kids nearly ran out because Democrat-controlled House refused to act. 
Instead, my colleagues on the majority called it a fake emergency. Faced with years of congressional inaction, President Trump was right to declare a national emergency, but the bill before us includes a short sided--short sided change to national emergency authority to that--that will upend the progress the president has made to secure the border. 
The bill adds burdensome requirements to intentionally limit the amount of military construction funds available to an emergency--in an emergency regardless of the nature of the emergency, again barring COVID-19. Section 2801 changes current law to insert potentially dozens of other laws, including environmental laws into military construction process and overrides existing authorities granted by Congress. 
This innocent looking language will be born to activist--will be a boon to activist lawyers looking to go after a single missed form. Today, the crisis is at the border. Tomorrow, the president's emergency authority to use military construction funds may be needed for an even worse crisis. This language ties the hands of the United States to respond to any future emergency, including natural disaster or another terrorist attack. 
The only exception is for COVID-19 crisis. That carve out tells me a lot. That carve out means the majority knows they don't want these unrealistic restrictions imposed on an emergency in progress. It tells me it's a political game. 
Again, I oppose this language, tying the president's hands. I'm not happy that defense funds are being used for border security. But, Congress has neglected our responsibilities in this area for so long, the president has had no alternative. 
I understand the majority is committed to keeping this provision. While I'm strongly opposed to the provision, I believe it's best to postpone its further consideration. But, with that, Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment and yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Rogers. It is now in order to call up Log number 009. For what purpose does the gentlelady from Michigan seek recognition? 
SLOTKIN: Pardon me, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: It's all right. 
SLOTKIN: Mr. Chairman, the amendment I'm proposing--I'm sorry-- 
SMITH: --You have an amendment at the desk-- 
SLOTKIN: --Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. I apologize. 
SMITH: Yes. Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the chair recognizes the gentlelady to discuss her amendment. 
SLOTKIN: Mr. Chairman, the amendment I'm proposing would strengthen our response to an issue of bipartisan concern in my state, PFAS contamination. The committee and this Congress took historic action last year in the NDAA to address contamination by PFAS forever chemicals in a number of important ways: by requiring DOD to stop using PFAS latent foam immediately in training and exercises, stop using PFAS firefighting foam by 2024 altogether, come up with a plan for PFAS disposal and cleanup, and to test for PFAS exposure in firefighters--firefighters. And, finally, it included my PFAS Monitoring Act, requiring for the first time that the EPA include PFAS in the chemicals that municipalizes must test for drinking water. 
In this amendment today, we would push DOD to clean up PFAS contamination according to the most stringent available standard, whether set at the state or federal level. This matters because Michigan and other states with significant PFAS contamination can't afford to wait for the EPA as it drags its feet on the federal standards. 
Michigan is moving forward to set our own drinking water standard, consistent with the best available scientific evidence. And, if the Pentagon cleans up PFAS contamination in our state, I want that clean up to abide by Michigan standards. 
This issue is so important to my state that I raised it directly with the Secretary of Defense when he testified in front of our committee in February. I asked him if he'd abide by the most stringent standard available. He said that as long as the law told him to, he would clean up, research, and do development up to that standard. I asked the same thing of (INAUDIBLE) Maureen Sullivan. 
Neither were opposed to this amendment principally. It aims to require DOD to clean up PFAS contamination based on the sand--the safest standard available. That's all it's asking to do. It would cut through the bureaucratic arguments and that's all I'm asking. 
Last year, we ensured that DOD would have to abide by the strictest available standard when engaged in cooperative clean up agreements with the state. This language takes the commonsense step of extending that to all PFAS clean ups that DOD performs. I'd urge its adoption and yield back. 
DAVIS: Thank you, Ms. Slotkin. Mr. Lamborn, you have five minutes. 
LAMBORN: Thank you, Madam Chairman. I appreciate the intentions behind this amendment and the gentlelady said it well when she stated that last year, we put in a number of good provisions addressing PFAS and PFOA. 
In this year's NDAA, we are continuing that. We have nine provisions already in the bill and we have several provisions, three or so, that are in the--in the mark as of today. So, that's about a dozen more provisions that we're doing. 
I think that this one, though, is a bridge too far and I would ask for opposition against it. And, the reason is--well, there's several reasons. One is you would have a potential patchwork of different standards around the country that DOD has to comply with. California could have a very different standard than next door neighboring Nevada or Arizona. That would be inconsistent and would drive extra costs. That's--that's the first objection. 
Secondly, CERCLA, which is very strict already, already has stringent standards. This goes beyond even what CERCLA would require for superfund cleanup. And, that's a problem in my--in my opinion. 
EPA, despite what was just said, is taking action against PFAS and PFOA. On May 18th, about five weeks ago, they added 172 chemicals that are PFAS related to the Toxic Release Inventory. So, EPA is taking steps. I think they're taking rationale and measured steps according to science and measures like this that are a bridge too far would go beyond what science has determined. 
Some states, you said it yourself, are itching to do more and they would go beyond what science has determined as the acceptable risk. So, for all those reasons, a patchwork of national and state standards and the fact that we are addressing this in the NDAA last year and this year in many ways already, and EPA is addressing PFAS/PFOA. 
You know, I have this in my district. I'm very concerned. I've been following this and from firefighting foam at an air force base that has gotten into groundwater. So, I know this is a real issue and I know in Michigan, it's a real issue. But, this would just set up a lot of inconsistencies. 
And, lastly, I'll just say that for the states that would have high and strict standards like California and Washington and other states, that would drive extra cost for the military, especially air force bases located in those states, and, you know, that would have real implications for the placement of those bases in those states in the future. So, for all those reasons, I think that we should oppose this and Madam Chairman, I yield back. 
DAVIS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lamborn and Mr. Mitchell, you are next. 
[*]MITCHELL: Thank you, Madam Chair. There's a lot of things, Ms. Slotkin, that I agree on. We come from neighboring districts. I have a base in my district and we share a lot of perspectives on it. 
I have to agree with Mr. Lamborn that this--there are significant provisions, additional provisions, we've put in both the base bill and amendments. I counted about a dozen as well. In order to deal with the PFAS/PFOA issue and address it on a consistent and national base--basis. A patchwork does a couple of things. Not only does it cause problems for the Department of Defense. It creates all kinds of operational issues at bases. 
The other question I'd ask is what other areas will we decide that we not want to have a patchwork of standards for various environmental issues? Are we going to have California set emission standards for the bases out there different than the rest of the country? Go through your list of other areas of states--or legislators who want to create different standards for the Department of Defense (INAUDIBLE) have a defense facility. 
At some point in time, we have to say we've got to have a consistent set of standards. Let us not also pass off the value of science and actually looking at what we do with PFAS/PFOA and simply say, we'll just set standards because tighter standards are better for everyone. They may not be achievable. They may not be necessary. 
But, certainly at this point in time, a patchwork doesn't help the department do the job they first and foremost have to do for us. So, I oppose it and would ask that my colleagues join me. And, I have to say if we decide that we're going to go forward with it, I will ask recorded vote because I think we need people on the record of how we're going to move forward with this. I yield back, thank you. 
DAVIS: Thank--thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Garamendi. 
GARAMENDI: Thank you, Madam Chair. CERCLA already requires the Department of Defense to apply state standards if those standards are higher. The problem is that the Department of Defense has not done so. 
Now, speaking for California, which does have generally strong standards, I would suspect that if our const--if your constituents were aware of PFAS contamination in their community, they would want the highest standards. They may, in fact, want California standards rather than the federal standards if they knew what was going on. 
This amendment is really a very important one for all of us because all of us represent local communities. And, this standard allows-- 
MITCHELL: (INAUDIBLE) 
GARAMENDI: --us the opportunity to--or this amendment allows our local communities to achieve and to have the highest standards that our individual states might have and would prohibit or require the Department of Defense to apply the higher state standard if in fact the state standard is higher. 
I cannot imagine any of us going back home and saying, ""Not to worry, we're going to take the lower standard rather than the higher standard for our community."" I--I know what I want for my community and I happen to represent a community whose military base has contaminated the water supply. Now, it just happens as California, we happen to have a high standard in California and therefore yep, we're going to make sure the Department of Defense applies the higher California standard than any other standard that the Department of Defense might choose to apply. 
So, Mr. Mitchell-- 
MITCHELL: --Does the gentleman yield (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GARAMENDI: --you're about to have a fit down there if you don't get a chance to comment, so why don't you take 30 seconds of my time and then we can debate this? 
MITCHELL: Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Garamendi. We've done that before. 
DAVIS: The gentleman yield? 
MITCHELL: The gentleman yield for--thank you. 
GARAMENDI: Of course. 
MITCHELL: We'll go for 15. I'll make your promise. I won't suggest that any of your constituents are ill informed if you don't suggest that Michiganders are. That would be great. I think they are well aware. The PFAS has been extensively discussed by both in the media, as well as by elected officials. I don't think anybody passes it off as not a concern. 
I think rationale science ought to be applied to it and simply setting standards because we want to pick a number doesn't necessarily apply as science. But, thanks for the time and let's--I'll stay in Michigan, you stay in California. We'll both be happier. I yield back. Thank you. 
GARAMENDI: Well, you might want to look at your neighbor who is proposing a higher standard for your neighborhood. So, I'll let it go at that. 
MITCHELL: It doesn't have the base, but thank you. 
DAVIS: Would the gentleman yield? 
GARAMENDI: I know you're trying to bring me under control, Ms. Davis, but prior experience would indicate that's not possible. 
MITCHELL: That's my job. 
(LAUGHTER) 
DAVIS: (INAUDIBLE) 
GARAMENDI: --With that, I yield back. 
DAVIS: Okay, thank you. I think Mr. Cisneros is next, Mr. Garamendi. 
CISNEROS: Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, somebody who served in the Navy using PFAS, the technology has improved. It's time for the country to move on and to move onto this newer technology that's a lot safer and with that, I yield back--I yield my time to Rep Slotkin. 
SLOTKIN: I appreciate the comments of Mr. Lamborn and Mr. Mitchell. We do work on lots and lots of things together. Mr. Lamborn, if I am being greedy about PFAS amendments, I am proud to be greedy. I know that we've done a lot of really good work in this bill and I appreciate the bipartisan nature of it. I--I really do and I know that that means it's going to succeed and last year we did a lot of work too. But, it's only because we're literally playing catch up after 30 years of us knowing that this chemical is harmful and it being all over many of our communities. I have four PFAS sites in my own district. 
So, I'm proud to be greedy. I don't think that we're doing anything different than what we did last year, where we did say that we'd sign cooperative agreements up to the strictest standards. So, I don't think the patchwork argument works because we've already gone and done that with DOD clean up and these cooperative agreements last year. 
I don't think that this is unnecessary and duplicative of CERCLA and to my friend, Paul Mitchell, who does represent the base or one of the bases in Michigan, along with actually Mr. Bergman, the--the science from Mr. Mitchell's alma mater is what is behind the governor wanting a higher standard for our PFAS clean up. And, I appreciate the debate, I appreciate the conversation and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Conaway. 
CONAWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield to Mr. Lamborn. 
LAMBORN: I thank the gentleman and I would just ask the spon--the sponsor to take yes for an answer. We really addressed this in dozens of ways last year and this year. If we get beyond what science has established--and I'm not sure that all 50 states will do that. Some will get--have the potential of going beyond what science has established and call for stringency that is not yet verified by science. 
And, if that's the case, that's going to drive remediation expenses that are not yet called for. And, knowing how important readiness and operations and maintenance dollars are in our budget, I want to make sure that when those dollars are spent for remediation, it's been established by science. And, I would hope the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee would agree with me on that. 
So, let's stick to science. I--I trust the EPA. We may not--you may not like every single appointment but we're talking about thousands of scientists who work at EPA. Many have been there for decades for many--multiple administrations and they're--they're working on this. 172 chemicals were listed in the Toxic Inventory on May 18th, last month, or two months ago. 
So, we are making real progress and I just think this is going to drive potentially needless expenses if we go beyond the science. With that, I yield back to the gentleman from Texas. 
SMITH: Thank you. 
CONAWAY: I--I yield. 
SMITH: Apologize. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does anybody else seek recognition? 
KIM: Yeah, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: I'm sorry, Mr. Kim. 
KIM: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to take a moment to thank Congresswoman Slotkin for pushing this forward. This is extremely important to my community as it is to all of ours and I'm proud to be able to be a supporter here. So, I'll be a strong yes on this one. Back to you, chairman. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Bishop. 
BISHOP: Yeah, I don't want to take a whole lot of time on this, but I--I need to speak out in favor of Mr. Lamborn's position because I--since I don't know about the details of this, I went to the Water District that's around the base where I serve and asked them on their situation and what they are doing. 
And, what--and on their behalf, what they ask is that since they are doing the monitoring already and there has yet to be a threat, they don't expect one in the immediate future. They actually don't expect a long term threat either. They just want to have some kind of consistency in the standards for which they are supposed to be using. 
They simply want it held to a national legal standard, not necessarily being changed at the whim of someplace else. If it changes in part A, do they have to go to that standard or do they stay where they are? That was their concern. 
What they actually asked me to say is simply that the position of the maximum containment levels in groundwater that EPA and DOD considers should be based on good science and not speculation on the effects of human health and for them, they wanted some consistency. So, I need to add that as their--their viewpoint. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. All right, all those in favor of the amendment offered by Ms. Slotkin will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. Mr. Mitchell. A roll call vote is requested. We will hold this roll call vote over until the end of business when it will be put in order with the rest of the roll call votes. 
And, it is now in order to consider Log number 73 and for what purpose does the gentleman from New Jersey seek recognition? 
NORCROSS: (OFF-MIC) 
SMITH: Oh, sorry. Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the chair will now recognize the gentleman from New Jersey to explain his amendment. 
NORCROSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The amendment would strike the provision on the collective bargaining authority included in the chairman's mark and replace it with the prohibition on the departments using FY21 funds to carry out the authority to prohibit DOD civilians from collective bargaining. 
Very simply, this is about the Executive order that President Trump issued back in January on the 29th that stripped--potentially stripped--DOD employees of their collective bargaining rights. In addition, the Secretary of Defense would be prohibited from excluding any DOD agency or subdivision from collective bargaining rights until 30 days after a report. 
When the original Trump order came out, shortly thereafter--it might have been even the next day--the Secretary of Defense was testifying before us and I had an opportunity to ask him was he aware of this order coming out and he responded no. I asked him if he requested it. He also said no. And, that goes to the heart of this. 
We followed that up, asking were there any issues on the collective bargaining agreements that would interfere? Not only did he say no, but the relationship that he described between what he had in the past and currently as the Secretary of Defense relationship, he thanked his employees. 
So, the idea of putting this out there is kind of bewildering. But, on the reverse side, it could be very damaging to the relationships that have built up over the years. Especially now in the COVID, the idea of working with the--the collective bargaining agent, in this case the unions, has been actually quite good. They've been able to work through these issues. So the idea of stripping that from the employees so the voice of the workers would no longer be heard is counter-intuitive to the exact reason why it is there. The Department of Defense had 650,000 civilian employees, just shy of 500,000 represented by unions. The bargaining unions that are allowed to bargain have been there since it was first created in 1962. 
The--the FSLMRS--which is the agency that oversees part of this--has the ability to not let unions collectively bargain for certain agencies. An example would be FBI, CIA, NSA. And these are because of the national security sensitivity of what's going on. And it has worked well. 
And that's the point that I want to lead this is why are we stirring the pot creating this animosity at such a time that they're the essential workers. They're the ones that everybody in this room thanks for being on the front lines. They're the ones that continue to work. And I think that's incredibly important for us to send a message to them that we are with you in this particularly during COVID. 
I think it would send a horrible message--and the fact of the matter if there were somehow an issue which nobody can remember--the president still has the authority to send them back to work. So, with that I would urge adoption of this simple amendment and say thank you to those who have been on the front line of the COVID. With that I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Norcross. Is there any other member who wishes to speak on the amendment. Representative Byrne from Alabama. 
BYRNE: Thank you. My friend from New Jersey and I usually have these debates in the other committee we're on, the Education and Labor Committee. It's interesting we're having it here. 
This issue comes up under Title 5 of the United States Code Section 7103(b). It was adopted in 1978 by a Democrat Congress and signed by a Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. It is a very limited authority to the president and can only be used under circumstances where the agency or subdivision has their primary function--intelligence, counter-intelligence, and national security work--and provisions of the chapter cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a matter consistent with national security requirements and considerations. 
So, what the president did was take the authority that every president has had since Jimmy Carter and delegated it to the Secretary of Defense. As the gentleman noted, the Secretary of Defense did not ask for it. And we've actually checked over there. They have no plans to use this delegated authority. So, this is not--the president's given them the authority. And they said we don't plan to use it. 
So I--I don't think that there's any negative impact that's been demonstrated nor is there any harm from a president delegating this sort of power to a Secretary of Defense with regard to people that work for the Department of Defense. As a practical matter the secretary is closer to the issues that might be involved there than the president. So, it actually makes sense that he would make that delegation under these circumstances. 
So, I understand where the gentleman's coming from. You were surprised, the Secretary of Defense was surprised. We--we were all surprised. But as it's turned out in the time that's elapsed since then, nothing's happened. And the Secretary of Defense has no intention of making everything happen. So, it seems to me we're in search of a solution for a problem that doesn't exist. And I don't like limiting presidential authority under emergency circumstances which is what this is. 
I want to keep presidents with that authority, because there may be circumstances where they absolutely have to use it. Now, you're doing this with this president. There's going to be a president after this president-- 
UNKNOWN: --I'll be there. 
(LAUGHTER) 
BYRNE: Whether it's January of two thou--two--2021 or 2025. And that person may be a president you like. So be careful about making decisions where something's been in the law this long that are particular to one president. We made that mistake when President Obama was president. And so, I--when I--and I told people at the time, there's going to be a president after President Obama. Let's not think of these things in the context of just that president. 
So, I know your--your--your--your amendment is limited to a limited time period. But you're setting a precedent for the Congress to temporary limit a president's authority in an emergency situation. And I think that is a very, very dangerous, slippery slope. Take out the name Donald Trump and if it helps you put in the name Joe Biden and say do you want to limit Joe Biden like this. I don't think you do. I think this is your effort to speak out against what the president--what President Trump has done-- 
NORCROSS: --Will the gentleman yield? 
BYRNE: And so--just one more second-- 
NORCROSS: --Sure. 
BYRNE: So, I--I just ask us to think about that. And I certainly will yield but retain my right to get it back. 
NORCROSS: I appreciate it. And we've worked together as--in--on labor and education. You're right. The authority of any president was there. But exercising that authority to give it to the Secretary of Defense is like handing a gun to a person and putting it to their head. I'm not going to pull the trigger, but that gun is against your head. 
And that is the fundamental difference where the threat is there versus is the president still holding back on that authority if he needed it. Because at the end of the day we have to remember we're in COVID. And these are the people we thank every day who now feel attacked that the gun is to their head. We're not going to shoot you, but you have that gun to their head. 
BYRNE: Well--reclaiming my time. I don't want a gun to anybody's head. I really don't. I particularly don't want to have some sort of threat out there to employees at the Department of Defense--you're absolutely right. We depend on every day they come here and give us information and of course they're defending the country. But remember, this is limited to emergency circumstances. And the president's not keeping the authority he's delegating the authority to the Secretary of Defense who is closer to those very people. Who's going to know is there some reason to use this or is there a reason not to use it. 
And so far with the passage of time he's shown there's no reason to use it. And I frankly have confidence in the man--Secretary Esper--that he's going to exercise that judgment soundly. So, I respectfully oppose your amendment. I think that we ought to be thinking longer term with this. And with that Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. The gentleman from California, Representative Garamendi is reco--recognized for five minutes. 
GARAMENDI: It's unfortunate we're even having to deal with this. The law has been in place for a long time. And it's--the law limits the authority generally to spurt--certain non-critical parts of the Department of--of the government. Period. For those critical immediate parts of the government it's clear. The president's delegation appears to open the door to much broader neg--limitations by the secretary. 
It just seems to me that what we need to do here with this amendment--and what we are doing with this amendment is pushing back and saying wait a minute. There's--don't go create a problem. Mr. President, you created a problem. We want things to be as they were. We don't need to stir the pot as Mr. Norcross said. 
Things are moving--things are fine. There's not an issue going on. There's--but--but the president did his Executive Order and now there's a potential for some sort of a labor management brawl in the future if Mr. Esper decides he wants to have a labor management brawl. I don't know about guns to heads and all that, but I'm going why are we having to deal with this. Well, because the president exist--did an Executive order. 
And we're saying no, we don't want that Executive order. That's where this amendment comes in. And yes, indeed it is limited to the fiscal year 2021. And yes, there will be a new president that will have to--if this becomes law will have to endure a full nine months--no eight months--well, not--eight months plus of this particular section. 
So, I think we ought to pass this. I think we ought to say Mr. President, why did you create this problem? We don't want this problem. This amendment says you're not going to create a problem. So, Mr. Norcross do you need more time. 
NORCROSS: I'm good. 
GARAMENDI: Then I'll yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Who--does anyone else seek recognition on this amendment? 
UNKNOWN: If you want--do-- 
UNKNOWN: --You're--it's your call. I'm--I'm not going to make that call sir. 
UNKNOWN: I'll go tell my one support for this--(INAUDIBLE)--sure. 
SMITH: All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair the ayes have it-- 
UNKNOWN: --Roll call-- 
SMITH: --Roll call is requested. Further proceedings on this amendment will be suspended until the end when we will have a roll call vote on it. It is now in order to consider Log 563. For what purpose does the gentleman from Utah seek recognition. 
BISHOP: I have an amendment that wherever the mythical-- 
SMITH: --The desk-- 
BISHOP: --electronic desk is-- 
(LAUGHTER) 
--Wherever it is it's there. Yes. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. And the gentleman is recognized to explain his amendment. 
BISHOP: Thank you Mr. Chairman, I appreciate--appreciate the recognition. Look, at the Fallon Navy Range and Training Complex in Nevada we know there are significant gaps in both their air and graining--and ground training capabilities. The shortcomings are not in dispute. They are given. Remain--remaining with the status quo doesn't solve any of the problems. 
But with all of the land provisions that were included in this particular amendment, it is important to know that the product of each of those transfers that would lead towards fixing their gaps in their training capabilities were the product of their own counties. Their counties and their cities master plan and zoning process. It's 100 percent a product of the people of Nevada. 
They coordinated with the state of Nevada through the Nevada Division of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Nevada Division of Wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They even continued to have and continue to have ongoing discussions with the tribes that are living in that surrounding, that particular area. They provided--all sorts of changes that were provided. 
For example the prehistoric salt caves that are there in the Dead Camel Mountains would be put into a trust in which case those caves would have greater protection under this change and with the--with the Department of Defense than they have right now with the federal government and the BLM that actually owns that land in the first place. 
So, there's--there's actually a million acres of new protected land included in this approach once again with the goal of--of fixing the shortcomings that are not in dispute with the--with the ground and air training capabilities. Navy doesn't object to any of those transfers. Navy is--is favorable to this. The state of Nevada doesn't object to it. The senior representative from Nevada, it's his bill. He is certainly not objecting to it. 
Seems like the only place that there is an objection to what is going on here is by special interest groups that look at the military of the United States as a deep pocket for some other proposals going somewhere. So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I am done with my presentation and may make a motion in a minute. But I want to see if somebody else who has something to say. 
SMITH: Fair enough. Mr. Gallego. 
GALLEGO: Yes. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Bishop. I understand this amendment offer, Mr. Bishop, is based in part on legislation that's been introduced by Mr. Amodei and I--I've been briefed on it. I also understand that Congressman Amodei is open to working to resolve still outstanding issues that directly impact the Walker River and Pan--Paiute Indian tribes. 
I share a desire desire to find a way forward that resolves these issues in a way that satisfies all parties including both tribes, the Navy, and the state of Nevada. As a member of both this panel and the Natural Resources Committee I look forward to working with Mr. Bishop, Mr. Amodei, as well as Mr. Horsford, Chairwoman Haaland, and Chairman Grijalva on this legislation. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Bishop-- 
BISHOP: --Mr. Chairman--with that--and I appreciate the comments by Mr. Gallego. He--he obviously is auditioning for those disclaimer statements that are given in commercials. 
(LAUGHTER) 
You've done a darn good job at it. I ask to withdraw the amendment. 
SMITH: The amendment is withdrawn. Thank you Mr. Bishop. It is now in order to consider Log 642. For what purpose does the gentleman from Florida seek recognition? 
GAETZ: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the court please distribute the amendment. Without objection we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. The gentleman from Florida is recognized to discuss his amendment. 
GAETZ: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This amendment is similarly flavored and will likely achieve a similar outcome of the prior amendment. When dealing with the need for requisite space for our research, development, tests, and evaluation mission the Eastern Gulf of Mexico is unique in all of the world in that it presents the opportunity for a live fire testing that not only is air to air but also can be launched over water. And then with detonation on land as a consequence of the--the unique topography and unique real estate in this area. 
Unfortunately, in 2022 the GOMESA protections that the Congress has adopted against oil and gas exploration will expire. And a lot of our energy special interest groups are real excited about that and doing everything they can to facilitate its expiration. I think the House should take a strong su--position in support of this type of testing, research, and development. And we should face back the attacks on the Gulf test range. And particularly given just the way the oil commodity markets have worked now it seems like no better time to extend these protections. 
I do intend to withdraw the amendment because I have not come as the chairman has requested with a waiver from the Natural Resources Committee-- 
(LAUGHTER) 
--I--I do hope that we're able to work together in the Rules Committee for floor action on the issue. But prior to withdrawing the amendment I wanted to yield to Mr. Bishop for a moment. 
BISHOP: Well thank you. Let me--let me just say this. Even though I voted on the floor against this particular motion I want to commend what Representative Gaetz is actually doing here as an effort to try and bring cloture to an issue that we have been talking about now for about three years. Right? And that in my mind there is a significant and an easy compromise that should be done to actually solve this issue now and forever. 
Because let's face it. This area was put off limits for military purposes and military protection. And where that military protection area is still needed it makes total sense that it should be off limits for any other activities. But there is a way of going about it that doesn't have to be dramatic and I think three years ago it was some people from a different point of view that were objecting to coming up with a solution. 
I think today there is people from a different point of view from that objecting to coming up with a solution. But I still believe there is a solution out there. And I appreciate Mr. Gaetz's efforts on behalf of his constituents and the military in his district to try and work on this issue. And I--I want him to know that I still think there is an--an easy way of solving this problem. We just don't have the right people in the room sitting down to agree that it's the easy way of doing it. And I appreciate with that and with that I will yield back to Mr. Gaetz. 
GAETZ: I thank the gentleman for yielding. I--I would only conclude by suggesting that with what we've learned in the committee about the need for more expansive ranges and more capable ranges to accommodate hypersonic and supersonic testing, I can't imagine that the reasonable solution would--would constrain the operations of our military as much as we would want to enhance it. 
But again I--I am grateful for the guidance of the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee and I'm grateful for the chairman's continued guidance and support on the issue. I withdraw the amendment and yield back. 
SMITH: The amendment is withdrawn. It is now in order to consider Log 6. For what purpose does the gentleman from Maryland seek recognition? Sorry, Anthony you're up. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Apologize for that. We moved kind of quickly there. And while--while we're giving a moment here, this amendment is going to have a second degree amendment. The guy over there is calling a vote here. We're going to try to work our way through that second degree amendment. If we can get through it quickly enough to vote on it we will. If it looks like the debate's going to last so long that we can't get to the vote on the floor, we will recess temporarily to take the last vote, come back, and take the vote then. 
So be--be prepared for that. And Mr. Brown for what purpose do you seek recognition? 
BROWN: Mr. Chairman I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. And the gentleman from Maryland Mr. Brown is recognized. He does need to I think turn on his microphone. But he is recognized to explain his amendment. 
UNKNOWN: Okay. You're a big shot. I get it. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Okay. 
BROWN: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I first want to thank Congressman Bacon for his partnership bringing forth this important amendment. And I also want to thank so many members on the committee on both sides of the aisle who have reached out over the course of the past few weeks in an effort to find common ground on a solution to renaming installations who are named after officers and soldiers of the Confederate armies. I want to thank those who have been working in reaching this solution. 
This amendment would establish a firm process to rename military bases and infrastructure honoring leaders of the Confederacy within one year. Military leaders, active duty troops, veterans, civil rights organizations, and everyday Americans have long called for changing the names of these installations. 
This is not an issue that requires a great deal of study. A vast majority of Americans support this. A vast majority of members of Congress support this. And a vast majority of senior leadership both civilian and military at the Department of Defense in the service components seek this change. 
We are grappling with the country's painful past and must acknowledge that the history and cause of the Confederacy is centered on slavery and oppression. Highly visible instances of racial violence and racism have underscored the immediate need for change. Already the Marine Corps and Navy banned the Confederate Battle Flag from all installations, ships, and aircraft. Defense Secretary Esper is considering banning Confederate imagery across the military. 
My amendment, Mr. Chairman, requires the Secretary of Defense to identify installations, facilities, and infrastructure honoring Confederate leaders to be renamed. It recommends the Department consider Medal of Honor recipients, combat heroes, trail blazing troops from minority groups or individuals with links to the community where the base is located for the new designations. The symbols and individuals that our military honors does in fact matter. It matters to the culture of inclusivity and unity needed for our military to get the job done. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk to Mr. Brown's amendment. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute--will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. And the chair now recognizes Mr. Thornberry to explain his amendment. 
THORNBERRY: Thank you Mr. Chairman and--and just so you and the members know my impression is we will have very few speakers on--on our side of--of the aisle on--on this issue. I--I first want to thank Mr. Brown and--and General Bacon for their work. There have been several variations of this amendment. I think they tried to get it right. And what I really appreciate is the spirit in which they have gone about that task. 
And--and I'd also say I--I would never praise or condone violence or destroying property or the--some of the things we've seen. But there's been a lot of good that has come in recent weeks from a greater focus and increased understanding of lingering racial bias in this country. 
And I'll just say for me personally, I thought the statements by some military leaders particularly General Vince Stewart who many of us worked with in various capacities at--at DIA--well before that in Marine Corps, DIA, at CYBERCOM--was very powerful about what he and his family have faced. General Brown, the new Chief of staff of the Air Force, a very strong statement. 
And--and--and those kinds of things have provoked discussion and a kind of self-examination that--that I think we need to have. To me the most powerful and desirable outcome is increased understanding and changed hearts. Because we are in the law making business we tend to first turn to legal mandates. And sometimes that's necessary. But sometimes rather than just decide ourselves and dictate to the country if we can prod discussion--if we can encourage that sort of self-examination it's going to have deeper and longer lasting effects. 
And--and so that's the attitude that I take in this amendment to what Mr. Brown has--and--and General Bacon have started. Trying to push and prod into more discussions, more examinations rather than just issue a mandate without the kind of local discussion and consultation that would be most helpful. 
So, I'll--basically I--I take Mr. Brown's amendment--and there are really three differences between his amendment and mine. Number one is he says you got to change the names of the bases. I say you must examine whether to change the name of the bases and explain publicly why you do or do not do it. And my hope is that that sort of public report with a rationale will help foster the kind of public discussion and examination that--that I mentioned while ago. 
The second difference is my amendment requires consultation from the very beginning rather than require consultation towards the end when you're just trying to figure out what to change the name to. I think it's important for local communities, service members, retirees, civil rights groups to have the first conversation about whether the name of the base should change. And but partly because I want to--everybody to have to hear someone say this is the way I feel--feel when I drive up to Fort Hood. Or Fort Bragg. 
And--and--and if you don't have that sort of consultation then you're missing out on part of at least in my view what needs to happen. Third difference is time frame. Mr. Brown's amendment makes it a 90 day report and then it's all got to be done in a year. I take a year to have the first consultation. And then another year to decide what you're going to change the names to. Again, part of it is to facilitate this sort of discussion. Part of it is I think this is too big a job to do in--in that short amount of time. 
I'll go ahead and--and say my personal opinion is that the name of some if not all of these installations should be changed. But this is not about my opinion. This should be about helping the country through--by forcing a conversation and examination by helping the country move closer to actually living out that creed that all men are created equal. And it should be about how--together the conversation about getting closer to a more perfect union. 
Rather than say this is what it has to be, let's help the country see this is the way it should be. And that's where I'm coming from on this amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. And let me just say that I agree with a lot of what Mr. Thornberry's had to say. I think this does need to be a process and I think we've--we've gone through that process in committee in a very helpful way. I know Mr. Thornberry's had conversations with his caucus, we've had conversations with ours. 
I especially want to--to thank Mr. Brown for his leadership on this issue. I think he has approached it in a very thoughtful and informed way. And I appreciate that. I know Ms--Ms. Escobar from our committee has also worked on this with Mr. Brown. And I completely support their efforts. And I think they've approached it in the exact right way. 
And I think the--the really important part of what Mr. Thornberry said is that this has to be a conversation hopefully not--not a shouting match. And there's--there's a lot of passion on this and that--and that is perfectly appropriate. But ultimately we do have to get to a place where--where we--we understand the history and understand the future and--and work together on it going forward. 
I--I do oppose the second degree amendment. And I support the--the underlying amendment that Mr. Brown put forward which sets the--the one year time frame to make these changes. Because thi--this is a much larger conversation. This is not just about bases being named. We have for our nation's history had unfortunately systemic racism across the country. And in particular ra--racism against black people. It's actually very well documented. And it didn't end with the Civil War as we all know. 
But interestingly at the turn of the 20th century when many of these bases were being named and when even many of the monuments were being erected this was all part of a larger effort to basically reassert white supremacy. Now I fully, fully understand that there's a lot of people who support the base names for a lot of historical reasons, for a lot of different--they may not have even known who--you know--Fort Bragg was named for, or Fort Hood was named for--for that matter. 
So, I'm not saying that everyone who--who likes the name did it for that reason. But I do think we have to come--come to terms with our history. And--and understand why this was done. And what that represents to a lot of people. And--and--and correct that. 
And I guess in this case when we're talking about--you know--what Mr. Brown's amendment narrowly focuses on, which is the names of bases and--and installations and a few other things specific to the bases--that if they were in fact named for people who participated in the--the rebellion against the U.S. that lead to the Civil War, I think this--this is reasonably--sorry. This is clear cut. This should not be. This does not have a place and--and--and the downside far outweighs any upside of maintain them. 
So, I as a member of Congress and this committee am willing to clearly state that these need to be changed. And I think--you know--I don't think they should do it tomorrow. Certainly, there is the effort to understand--okay if you're going to rename them what are you going to rename them to. And it's good to have people participate in that. 
But I think one--one year is a reasonable time frame. And I think it's the appropriate step. But again, I want to say I respect the folks who look at it from--from a different way in terms of giving a little bit more time to think about it. I just think in this case it's very clear cut that--that we should make that change. So again, I would urge opposition to the second degree amendment and support for--for Mr. Brown's amendment that--that he brought. 
Mr. Scott. 
SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I want to say I have a tremendous amount of respect for my friend and colleague Mr. Brown. I not only respect him, but I like him. And as someone who lives very close to Fort Benning I--I would like you to know that while I've lived within a couple of hours of Benning for almost 50 years now, I never knew who Fort Benning was named after until--until this discussion started on--on June 9th or 10th--whenever it--whenever it came into the press. 
And I--I thought maybe I should call some friends who served there and served in the military. And so, I called a--a friend of mine who's a Command Sergeant Major who--who's also an African American. And I asked him--you know--what he thought about it. And he said to tell you the truth Austin I didn't even know until--until the news came out and I--and I looked it up. 
So, I'm--I'm not oppo--in--in--I support a process that looks at this. I wish it had never been named after--after General Benning. If you look at his history it's--it's not one that I think we in this country should be proud of--of--of who General Benning was. But I--I do--I would also suggest that there're names like Sherman on bases. And if you're--if you're a Georgian and you look at--at what Sherman did through Georgia and--and the war crimes that--that he committed through Georgia I would suggest to you that things probably shouldn't be named after--after Sherman as well. 
And so, I--I'm open to a process. I do think that it has the potential to--to open Pandora's box and that when we take the names off the bases--we have libraries that are named after--after different people. We have streets that are named after different people. Certainly, there were crimes committed by--by soldiers on both sides of--of the Civil War. It was a--it was a horrible time in our nation's history. 
So, I--I hope the dialogue can continue. I hope it's respectful. I hope that both sides will--can soften their stances on--on these things and come to an agreement on them. But I would just suggest that--that there are--there are things named after people who fought on the side of the North who--who committed war crimes--war crimes as well. 
And certainly, open to a process that--that reviews names. But--but I don't--I don't think it should be targeted just at people who were in the Confederate Army. Crawford Long was a well known surgeon in the Confederate Army. He was not a soldier. One of the nation's premier healthcare institutions in the state of Georgia is named after--after Crawford Long. So certainly, some good things are happening in the country. 
NASCAR has said no more Confederate flags. Mississippi--I think that change there is good. I was a part of changing the Georgia flag over 20 years ago, which two-thirds of the state of Georgia's flag used to be the Confederate Battle Emblem. We--we took that down somewhere around 20 years ago. 
And so again, I respect my colleague. I like--we're--we're friends. I do hope we get to a process that looks at not just the names of Confederate soldiers but takes into account the naming of soldiers on--that--that maybe committed atrocities on the--on the Northern side as well. And God bless America. I'm glad we've got one flag. 
SMITH: Thank you. For--for members' in--information I think we're--we're going to do the same thing we did earlier. The--the vote's rolling now. It's not a typical--despite the clock and the--the screen there--this--they're still holding it open and doing the vote in--you know--alphabetical block. So, it gives us a little bit more time. 
But we are going to have this debate and when we get to the second degree vote we'll do the same thing we did last time. We'll hold that vote open until we make sure we get everyone voting. So, if you're worried about coming and going, we'll--we'll make sure we get enough time to get that--that vote in. So, we--again, once we get to the end of this debate and have the second degree vote, we will start it, but we'll make sure we get everybody before we close it. 
Who seeks recognition? Alright. Then we'll get there--I'm so--inches from a clean getaway. Ms. Davis, go ahead. 
DAVIS: Almost got free. Now Mr. Chairman, I--I'm just wondering. Maybe it's because I'm getting ready to leave. But it seems to me that you're actually not that far apart on this one. I--I think the process itself it--you know--community groups do well when they have--I think--benchmarks and--and deadlines. But sometimes they want to extend it on their own. Maybe there should be a provision to do that so it's not more than one year except with a consultation--with a group that decides that they need a little more time. 
It just seems to me that this is important. Emotional and that people have come fairly close on this it sounds to me. And that maybe this issue of process is really something that can be open enough that it's up to the communities to be able to determine whether or not they need an extension after what I would consider to be no more than a year. 
So, I'm just wondering whether--I haven't been a part of this so it's perhaps not fair to get into the discussion. But it just seems to me that I would love to see us actually come out of this together if that's possible-- 
SMITH: --Would--would the gentlelady yie--yield to Mr. Brown? 
DAVIS: Happy to. 
BROWN: Yeah thank you. While I--I resprect--I respect the ranking member's comparison of his amendment with mine, I do think it somewhat discounts the process that is in the amendment that I offered. There is consultation that allows the secretaries to form advisory committees that includes local leaders, civil rights leaders, and others in the process. 
And while I do agree that we need sufficient time to consider what that new name ought to be--and there's an entire year to do it--that's identical with the ranking member's. Because the ranking member is suggesting take a year to figure out which installations to change and then take the second year to come up with the name. So, in that sense, the amendments are the same. It gives one year to consider what the new name will be. 
The main difference is that I don't believe--and this amendment requires that we declare now that the names will be removed. We don't need consultation and consideration about that. These are--these are officers that lead a Confederacy that was in rebellion to our country. That represent the defense of slavery and that institution. There's a lot in the history that I don't know. 
I went--I learned to fly at Fort Rucker. I deployed to Iraq from Fort Bragg. I learned how to jump out of airplanes from Fort Benning. And I spent time at Fort Hood. There's a lot of my history that I don't know. I grew up not knowing about the savagery of slavery when I was in elementary school and middle school and high school, because my textbooks didn't have that. 
But I know today. And America knows today that these installations are named after officers who upheld that peculiar institution that inflicted so much pain and suffering on black people in America. We don't need a year of consultation for that. But yes, like the ranking member acknowledges, we do need a year for consultation on the new name and that's in the amendment that I offer. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you, gentlewoman. You yield? 
DAVIS: I yield. 
SMITH: Thank you. On hearing that the motion is now on Mr. Thornberry's amendment to Mr. Brown's amendment. All those in favor of Mr. Thornberry's amendment will say aye.

LARSEN: We'll--we'll let the gentleman's comments stand. Although I don't recall acknowledging your point of order, so. 
(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: The amendment is defeated. Which brings us back to the underlying amendment. I think we're good. So, we're now on Mr. Brown's amendment. Is there any further debate on Mr. Brown's amendment? I think we're good. Sorry. Let me take just one moment to get my lawyer and I on the same page here. So just a second. 
Is there something going on I'm not aware of here? 
UNKNOWN: No sir. 
SMITH: Okay. 
UNKNOWN: It's the same. You can roll it. 
SMITH: Further debate on Mr. Brown's amendment. Hearing none, all those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair the ayes have it. The ayes have it and the amendment is adopted. Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: Mr. Chairman I ask for a (INAUDIBLE)-- 
SMITH: --Roll call vote is requested. Further proceeding of this amendment will be suspended until the end of our proceedings and then we will vote on it with the others. Alright. Give that to you. 
We will now consider Log number 230. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from California seek recognition? 
SPEIER: Mr. Chairman I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and Ms. Speier is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of explaining her amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I rise to support this amendment that would remove factual review from military--factual sufficiency review from military appellate courts. No other court system in America allows an appeals court to throw out a hard won legally sound conviction simply because the appellate judges don't fully share the jury's conclusion on guilt or innocence. 
No other court system in America asks judges to look at a cold transcript of a trial and make a fresh evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. This unprecedented power allows appeals judges who were not in the courtroom and did not hear the evidence to throw out the jury's verdict and replace it with their own. 
For example, last year the Army Court of Appeals overturned a West Point cadet's rape conviction because they determined that the victim did not sufficiently physically resist or verbally cry out. So, the assault was more likely consensual. 
Now, anyone who has talked to rape victims knows that oftentimes they freeze because they fear for their lives. In another case last year, the Navy Marine Corps Court overturned a Marine Colonel's child sex abuse conviction because they decided that the six year old victim was not adequately specific and consistent in describing her assault. In neither case did the court conclude that the trial was otherwise unfair or irregular. 
In both cases the court simply inserted their judgment over that of the military personnel in the jury box. Factual sufficiency review is a relic of another era when courts martial were conducted without lawyers or an impartial judge. Today's military justice proceedings have caught up with and in some ways exceeded the requirements and protections in the civilian system. 
Legal errors are reviewed. Commanders are not allowed to influence trial outcomes. The victim and the accused are provided an attorney free of charge at both the trial and the appellate level. Nearly all U.S. appeals courts review the question of guilt using legal sufficiency review. The appellate court reviews the record to ensure some evidence was admitted at trial to fulfill each required element of proof. 
The appeals judge--judges ask whether a rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If so, the appellate judge defers to the trial court and affirms the conviction. To further the pursuit of justice, the amendment revises the UCMJ to apply the same legal sufficiency standard that is used in virtually every civilian court in the country. 
With that I reserve the balance of my time. 
SMITH: (INAUDIBLE) 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Got a couple things that we need to clarify here in this--and--and first off I want to begin by thanking Chairman Speier for the way that she has worked on a bipartisan basis for the sexual assault provisions that are in this bill, the way that she has worked with Trent Kelly and of course Susan Davis and myself for the Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus that--that works on a bipartisan basis. 
And this is something that I know we all feel incredibly impassioned about. There is nothing that is more important for us I think in protection of our service members than protecting our service members from violent sexual ass--attack and assault by our own service members. We have spent over a decade in spending a tremendous amount of substantive time, hearings and reviewing-- 
SPEIER: --This is about an amendment. 
TURNER: I'm sorry, is there--is there confusion Chairman Speier? 
SPEIER: Will the gentleman yield? 
TURNER: Sure. What's the confused--I heard you two guys talking. 
SPEIER: No, I just was curious whether this is the amendment you intended to speak on or was it the one about the pilot program. 
TURNER: No this is the--the--this is factual sufficiency. I-- 
SPEIER: --Correct-- 
TURNER: --I--I'm--yes-- 
SPEIER: --Thank you-- 
TURNER: --I'm--I'm on the right one. Thank you for--thank you for clarifying. 
The--the issue I think that's most important as you look to Congresswoman Speier's statements is she said almost all appellate court reviews follow what she's recommending. And we've not had a hearing on this. We've not--there's--actually--was--were previous studies on this that did not recommend this change. 
New York actually does the--has the--the same standard that we apply in military--tary courts. The--the concern that we have here is that the--the--Congresswoman Speier gave a number of examples of where the appellate court to her--to her interpretation stepped in and undid a case based on the--the determination by what was the lower court of the trier of fact. 
She's asking us to step in and be the trier of fact and say that what happened there was wrong. And--and--and we can't be trier of fact. We--we do--we can't--there--just because she lays out case x or case y where she believed that the reversal was inappropriate--I--I've not reviewed that case. You--none of us have reviewed that case. 
We--we have no legal basis for determining that we have to overhaul the entire system because of anecdotal descriptions that--that we're given by Congresswoman Speier. Now, this is--I mean--literally we've spent over a decade ensuring that every time we make a change in the military justice system with respect to sexual assault that we do so with thought, information, oversight, review, and input. 
We want to protect the accused. We want to oppre--protect the as--the assaulted. We want to ensure that the prosecution goes forward and that the--the person making the accusation has the utmost of protection and--and assistance to ensure that justice is done. 
This is not one that--that changes--that--that makes justice better. This is just one that--that Congresswoman Speier has decided that is inappropriate. But her words themselves--I hope you all paid attention. She said almost all jurisdictions in the United States do something different. 
Well that is no reason for us to take this up and adopt this amendment. I--this is a great one for a--for additional study. This is a great one for additional review. But for one member of Congress to step forward and say since almost all other jurisdictions don't do this, we need to change ours is dangerous. We need to I believe--and understand that we're at--we're affecting due process. We're affecting the rights of the accused. We're affecting the entire system on--on basically just a political speech. And with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too rise in opposition to this amendment. Court martials and the military justice are probably the fairest that we have. But because of the nature of military operations and requirements, we need to retain certain safeguards on the process. The military justice system is expeditionary and needs to be expedient. 
Court marshals happen all over the world and there are issues like access to evidence and witnesses and witness testimony that does not exist in civilian courts. Because military justice needs to be expedient, convictions only require three-fourth vote from the panel. Most jurisdictions require unanimous vote by the jury. 
Factual sufficiency review is a critical check on that. There are other existing safeguards not available to courts martial. For example, Federal trial judges had the ability to nullify and a verdict when they determine it is contrary to the evidence. Many states retain that same right at the trial-level court. Factual sufficiency is fair. We can't as a body sit here and call it just a--to flip the appellate system on its head based on a few results we don't agree with. 
When I was a practicing attorney and a practicing district attorney, I often found sometimes good facts lead to bad results and we cannot flip the entire appellate system on its head based on a few cases that we don't agree with the results. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Byrne. 
BYRNE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've worked with the gentleman in the past on important legislation and we've successfully worked things out. I was told that there was a report from-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Byrne, I don't think your microphone is on. 
BYRNE: Hello? 
SMITH: Yeah, you are maybe too far away from it. I don't know. 
BYRNE: I need to lean forward. Sorry. 
SMITH: (INAUDIBLE) 
BYRNE: I was told that in 2016, the Military Justice Review Group recommended adoption of a variant of the New York system. And essentially, an appellate would have to show to the court there's a reason for the court not to use the review of the facts. And so I was wondering if the gentlewoman considered that and if that might be perhaps a better way to go about this. It's a way to perform this system, but allow for there to be a determination that there needs to be an exception to what is the present rule. So I wonder if you had a chance to look at that. 
SPEIER: I thank that gentleman for his question. And we--we did look at that, but to look at New York's system as compared to the 49 other states that do not have this kind of factual sufficiency review and frankly New York system is much weaker. So this particular system was put in place before a time when we had defendants who had counsel, before we had a JAG Corps that was professionalized, before we had those who were serving as judges being trained. 
So what happens now is that you basically have a single appellate judge who can make a decision based solely on looking at a transcript, having never looked the victim in the eye, having never looked a defendant in the eye after it's already been decided by a jury of his or her peers. Another system that is more unique in the military than it is in the civilian world. 
BYRNE: So I looked at how this came about. So apparently, after both World War I and World War II, there was some terrible crimes. In fact, there were 61 black soldiers who were treated terribly. And so they made the changes in 1950 so that appellate judges in the military system could see an absolutely unjust result and look at the facts and say I'm going to override that judge below me because that judge below me obviously either didn't get sufficient defense brought forth to him or there was prejudice with that judge and it just didn't get the facts right. 
So the intent of it was actually to protect the accused in cases where they had not hitherto been adequately protected and also was in recognition of the fact that these aren't more summary proceedings then we are used to in several courts in the United--criminal courts in the United States. So the reason why there's a difference appellate standard in the military system is because trial standard is different in the military system. And because it's summary, as Mr. Kelly talked about, it's happening very fast, we have a higher likelihood than a mistake that a mistake can be made by a trial court. 
So it's my understanding that it's there actually to protect the accused going back 100 years. And that what New York does and what this commission proposed is that you kind of get to the middle. And the middle is is that that court has that authority, but appellate has the right to go to the court and say in this case, you should not use that authority and here's why. And there would be a requirement for the court to actually make a ruling on that before they could move forward with--with preserving the facts of the case. 
I just--as I looked at that, I thought that kind of made sense to me. Now, you and I have been through these sorts of things in the past in other legislation. You know how I approach things. So I hope the gentlewoman would be willing to work with us in whatever happens here and maybe we could work out something on that. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. And I guess I'd follow up with a quick--I yield to myself. I know that in--even in--and I'm way out of my depth here, I have a law degree, I have only very briefly practiced law of very long time ago, so there's a lot of people in the room here are smarter than I am on this--and if someone has an answer to this, I know in--in trial court, even outside of UCMJ, there was the, you know, judgment notwithstanding the verdict that that is available even In the normal courts. And it seems to me that what we're talking about here is the standard that has to be achieved in order to, you know, overturn the verdict. 
And I guess I would--I would start by asking Ms. Speier what--what is the difference between the standard now in UCMJ, which seems to be fairly loose to allow an appellate court to simply overturn it versus the traditional standard in regular court that's a in certain extreme cases, the judge can overturn the verdict anyways. I mean, there seems--it strikes me that this is not an either or. There ought to be a continuum of the standard that you have to achieve in order to reach this finding. Does any of that make sense and--and how does that affect what you're trying to do here? 
SPEIER: So thank you for the question. The legal sufficiency review by the U.S. appeals court really has a standard that requires them to look at the evidence and make sure that each of the required elements of proof are met. So that's different than having an appellate judge in this case just look at the transcript and decide I just don't agree. 
Now, what also is different, my--my good colleague from Alabama mentioned the changes that took place after World War II. That's true, but that was a very different set of circumstances. Today, actually better than in a civilian court, an appellate in the military court has an attorney that represents him at the appellate level. So in many respects, they have greater protections than in a civilian setting. 
And you know, back in World War II or right after World War II, there wasn't the professionalization of the JAG Corps or the judges that exist today. So if you look at the 80 cases that have been overturned, 50 of them I believe were sexual assault cases. When a judge can say, an appellate judge can say she didn't scream loud enough, she didn't resist enough, that are the words of someone who is grossly ignorant about victims of sexual assault, whether they are in the military or in civilian society. 
SMITH: If I could reclaim--claim my time just for a moment, I mean, I think it is too easy a standard for the appellate court to just say, you know, and as--as Ms. Speier points out, I mean in the trial, the people who are there whoever it is is adjudicating it, they see a whole bunch of things that you can't get from just reading the transcript. 
So I would--I would be troubled by simply allowing someone to look at it and go yeah, I see in the facts differently. That seems like a very low standard. On the other hand, I'm quite certain that this is something that has been studied with great--to reach this conclusion. 
But those types of results are not going to be acceptable within the UCMJ to have that sort of appellate power to simply overturn the facts of the case. So I'm going to support Ms. Speier's amendment. I'm happy to work with all of you going forward about how we may modify it to accommodate this, but those are some pretty egregious cases that we need to take a look at, you know, the power that appellate courts have. With that, I'll recognize Mr. Mitchell. Yes. I just recognized you. 
MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. This seems like an ideal issue to have had a hearing on to have heard from some so many appellate judges, to have heard a view of some of the cases, to have had the discussion about how decisions like this were made to understand, as you say, Mr. Chair, the spectrum, the range of decision-making at the appellate level and what that range ought to be and how that--that standard should be set. 
We did not have those hearings. We should have those hearings. I won't be here next term, but still, we should have those hearings so that in fact, we hear from people involved in that process so that members, some are attorneys, some or not, my mother didn't speak to me for nine months when I didn't go to law school. She was afraid I wouldn't make something of myself. I got lucky. 
But the reality is in this setting here to--to modify, to make wholesale changes in UCMJ on the fly is it pretty significant action. I would ask respectfully that we--we actually have had a hearing hearings on this. We talk about that appellate process. We have appellate judges in and then make an informed decision and not one here today because we may do damage and why make more damage? 
I agree with you. A case that in fact she didn't scream loud enough, oh my God. Come on. But we need to set a standard what should be done at the appellate level and we can't do that in 45 minutes or 30 minutes here and be responsible and confident it makes any sense at all. So I oppose the amendment. I encourage having the hearings. Have the appellate judges in--people in That just make cases before them and understand what dynamic is going on there. And I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Bishop. 
BISHOP: May I yield to Mr. Turner? 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, we have over 10 years in incredibly diligent in the changes that we have made with respect to sexual assault in the military. One of the cases that got me involved in this was Maria Lauterbach, which happened in my community where she was viciously murdered by the accused and was not protected at all. Asked for a base transfer, was not protected at all by the base and the base--the command--the Marines actually answered a letter from me after--after we were pursuing our legislative changes that seemed to respond to it by saying the that Maria Lauterbach had not reported any violence in the two rapes that she reported. 
Now I had at hearing after hearing after hearing asked everyone who came from the military could you please tell me what a non-violent rape is and not one person could. There are absolutely--because there isn't, of course. It is inherently violent. And we undertook specific legislative reforms in responding every time. 
Now, I don't know of the cases that the Chairman Speier is talking about. I don't know if the statements that she's reading were dispositive. I don't know because we're not first a judicial body and we're not charters effect. I can't in the matter of time of her five minutes say that the--the military justice code needs to be changed because she tells me that someone made that statement on--on the speech that she has. 
What we have done before was actually dive in, look at what is the response--what--what occurred in this case, what went wrong, what actually happened to, what--where do we have to laser-like make these changes and we have made a mountain of changes. I understand, Mr. Chairman, that you're supporting this, but what I would ask is this needs to be studied. When this gets into--to--first off, it should have been studied by us. We should have been, I mean, obviously the Sexual Assault Prevention Council--Caucus should have been involved, the subcommittee should have had hearings, this is something where we should have had legal analysis of what are the consequences. 
Again, New York does it this way. This is not as if this is just some archaic thing that happened in the Renaissance, you know, and then was carried over into our military. This is actually something that is legally done even in the civilian world. To change it over anecdotal statements in--in a markup is not the way that we--we should approach this. 
So I would just appeal to you that we not go off the rails of what we have done before, which is this very thoughtful substantive analysis with legal understanding, council if--if this passes and you find this in and conference, I would ask that you do what we should have done before we have this amendment before us and that is have it studied. Have recommendations and an analysis. Have the--have the lawyers take a look at this and tell us what would be the consequences because due process is also affected. 
How does this affect precedent? When did these cases even--even happen? Has there been a change over the other--other changes because we've changed and affected the chain of command. These are all things that that should be substantively reviewed before we just go in and change them. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Let me just say I--I think Mr. Turner makes some good points about understanding exactly what's going on and why we're making the changes. Again, I would yield to Ms. Speier, I mean, to respond to that because I am--I've got a couple isolated examples certainly it seems egregious. There seems to be this seems to be a solution. 
What is your response to that? Is there more to this? Is this something you looked at over a extended period of time and how--how do you connect the change that you're proposing to the wrong that is--that you so clearly stated? 
SPEIER: Mr. Chairman, let me make this a little simpler. I'm going to withdraw the amendment. I'm going to take advantage of the opportunity to work with my good friend Bradley Byrne who we've worked with a number of bills before and offer this as an amendment on the floor and we'll work together to come up with what is I think going to be an outstanding solution. 
This--these are cases that are recent. I want to make that very clear. I also wanted to make it clear that we've been looking at this for over a year and yes, it would have been nice to have a hearing, but we've also been under COVID for the last three or four months. But with all of that, I will withdraw the amendment. 
SMITH: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think it's a very important subject to look more closely at because one thing that is absolutely true is a lot of great work has been done to try to address the sexual assault issue and certainly not just in the military, but on our committee, that's our responsibility. What is also clear is a lot more it needs to be done. We are not there yet, so we look forward to working on that and I thank Ms. Speier for her leadership. And for withdrawing that amendment. 
It is now in order to consider Log 233. For what purpose does the gentle lady from California seek recognition? 
SPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? And without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. And the chair recognizes Ms. Speier to explain her amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment establishes a military court protective order process to strengthen protections for survivors of intimate partner violence and other forms of harassment. Currently, commanders have the authority issued to issue protective orders. And my amendment would not change this authority at all. But it's important to understand the limitations of the current system. 
I've heard from countless JAGs that command orders are often hard to enforce outside of military installations. Since local law enforcement agencies typically expect or in some cases may require orders to be issued by a court. And let me remind my colleagues that only one-third of the troops actually live on basis. So the vast majority of them live off the base. 
My amendment would allow a victim, their counselor or prosecutor to request the military court protective order from a military judge or a military magistrate. These orders could be issued on an emergency or nonemergency bases with due process requirements. Both their requestor and the subject of the protective order would have the right to be heard at a hearing and orders would be reviewed every 30 days. 
Orders once issued would comply with the full faith and credit requirement of that Violence Against Women Act to maximize the ability for the orders to be enforced and other jurisdictions. Further, the amendment would direct DOD to enter into reciprocity agreements with nearby jurisdictions to ensure that both military court protective orders are enforced off base and that protective orders from other jurisdictions are enforced on base. 
In short, the amendment would establish the system with greater due process protections for both victims and subjects. It's long past time that military survivors of intimate partner violence have protective order options that are as effective as those from state and local jurisdictions. And I would ask for your support in this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Turner. 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, regardless of the debate, I wanted to thank Congresswoman Speier for her dedication on this issue, her she has absolutely the right part on this and this is--this is one where our committee has worked to protect the victims of sexual assault. But beyond that, to protect all service members because I know what we all know who've worked on this issue and have ever had any exposure to it is that also service members are victims when they believe that the system doesn't work, when they believe that they are not protected. 
And so it's absolutely important that we be diligent on this. I am going to speak in opposition to this amendment because, sadly, this one goes to the same process that we had with the others. There is no evidence that the current process for issuing military protective orders isn't working and there is significant reason to believe that this amendment would cause the system not to work. 
Now the case that I spoke about in my community, Maria Lauterbach, we found in that case that there had been a military protective order that was issued, but there were two things that were wrong with it. One, when we were previously issuing military protective orders and that local community wasn't even told. So Maria Lauterbach, when she disappeared, the local Police Department had no--no notice at all that there had been a military protective order. And also, military protective order that had been issued for her expired. 
So we did two things. This committee. We made them so that the local community has to be notified, so that there if there is ever an issue that they can find them, and secondly, that they do not expire. Currently, they are issued by commanders. There is no evidence whatsoever that commanders are not issuing these. There is no evidence whatsoever that these that this process doesn't work. 
Now--but we do have a problem though that the military magistrate program is a very limited program. They're not available everywhere and a commander obviously is everywhere. A commander is--everybody has a commander. So the ability for a commander to issue this protective order instantly is important because we--we have to have them in place instantly. We can't have any delay because someone's life is at risk. So-- 
SPEIER: Will the gentleman yield? 
TURNER: Yes. 
SPEIER: This does not take away the commander's authority to issue an order. This creates another avenue for an order to be granted through the military magistrate for judge. I yield. 
TURNER: Well, if that's the case, that there's no one even on the staff who believes that. They believe this is absolutely completely supplanting the process that is there and that it is not an additive. But again, we've not had any hearings, we've not had any--no one that I don't--we don't even have anything as a--as a committee to know whether the military magistrate program wants this authority. 
We have no information as a committee as to whether or not even if it is, as you say, enhanced versus supplanting, which everybody over here believes it's supplanting remedies a problem that needs to be done. That we just--the work has not been done for us to take the action that would need to be taken for this level of legal change. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: Mr. Chairman, once again, I want to thank Chairwoman Speier for the hard work that we've done together on the Military Personnel Subcommittee. However, I have to rise in opposition to this also. All services do not have a robust military magistrate program to echo what Mr. Turner said. And the army will likely be the only service impacted. 
When we are trying to be the same across the board of DOD and we're weighing heavily on one service, that's one reason. Magistrates issue search authorizations and review detention orders. Commanders order detention. 
Access to magistrates and military judges is limited. Third party civilians of post will not have ready access, even if represented by special victims counsel or other counsel. Alleged victims have access to civilian courts where they can apply for a restraining order. There's no need to duplicate that system. 
There is nothing faster, more direct than a commander imposing a protective order and it will be imposed before an alleged victim even knows anything about it. This really is a redundancy. If registration is a concern, then why not change the law to require civilian entities to register commanders protective orders as they would a civilian restraining order? 
Commanders are currently required to notify civilian authority when a protective order is issued. Also, submitting to the attorney general is an onerous requirement. What is the attorney general in most states going to do with it? 
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment and I yield back. But I would like to--like in the previous--I would like to have hearings and explore and see how we can better do restraining orders to protect our victims on military posts. And I yield back. 
MITCHELL: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: Mr. Mitchell. 
MITCHELL: I have a question for Chairman Speier. If you could help me, it may help me understand this. At line 16, 17, then in 18, it talks about the judges and military magistrates have exclusive jurisdiction over the issuance of appeal renewal termination And military core protective orders. 
You said previously that this--this amendment did not circumscribe the short limit the base commanders from taking action. But this says exclusive--they have exclusive authority over it. I think that's part of the confusion that's arising with staff and with me on this amendment. Can you clarify it for me what the intent is here? 
SPEIER: I can. A military court order is different from a commanding officer's order. That's the only difference. JAGs came to us and said we were having problems having these enforced in local jurisdictions because they're not coming from a military judge or magistrate. We are augmenting the existing authority of a commander by also providing where feasible that use of a military court judge or magistrate. 
MITCHELL: One more question for you, if I could please. And I--I admit, I didn't make every subcommittee hearing, so I'll--I'll claim--did I miss a hearing and we talked we heard from JAGs on this about where this has happened and what they recommended change was? Did I did I miss a hearing on that or--or not? 
SPEIER: I mean, believe it or not, Mr. Mitchell, I mean, at not every issue that we take up here has had a full hearing. 
MITCHELL: I understand. 
SPEIER: Otherwise we'd have hearings every day of the week. But we have reached out to JAGs and to others to determine whether or not this would be of value. 
MITCHELL: I appreciate it. Just a question I was wanting a clarification. Thank you. 
TURNER: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: Yeah, I do agree with Ms. Speier. If--if the status if the requirement is that we have to have a full hearing before we include it in the mark the mark would be a heck of a lot shorter and we'd be done in like three or four hours. It is it is important--yeah, I know. You say that now, but when it's your thing that you won't put in there, I think you'd have a different opinion. 
TURNER: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: So I'm talking. I'll be with you in just a second. So what I'd like is rather than having a full scale fight here, I think if Ms. Speier is simply talking about adding options to get a protective order and not undermining the commander, we could argue about this all night. I would like, if we could, to include this and I will give you my commitment that we will work out any of these misunderstandings as we go to the floor and as we go to deal with the Senate, which is, you fully can understand will not simply accept this. 
So you will have bites at the Apple to try to work this out or we can argue all night long and essentially turn the markup into a public hearing on this matter. Is there any appetite for going ahead and letting me get away with that on the side that is opposing the amendment? Mr. Turner? 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate your willingness to work on the issue because obviously, if it's confusing to us, it's certainly going to be confusing to DOD. One of the things that needs to happen, I mean obviously, Congresswoman Speier apparently has had independent conversations with individuals that have given a recommendation for this that we don't we're not all--all privy to. 
But one thing that needs to happen then is--is reaching out because, you know, a JAG officer here or there this doesn't necessarily mean that this is the answer or that this needs to be done. In the process, obviously the military magistrates need to be engaged In addition to JAG officers to determine do we really have a problem because I have not heard of it and-- 
SMITH: --Yeah, no and if I could-- 
TURNER: --And how does with the military magistrate program this fit because this may--this may not even fit. 
SMITH: And I completely agree. Those are conversations that need to happen. I will say in Ms. Speier's defense, it has been an unusual four months in terms of our ability to do that and these issues are important so we don't simply want to let them go. So again, I will seek out if anyone objects to us accepting this for the moment with my pledge and commitment to not simply jam it through without doing Mr. Turner just suggested and working with you. 
SPEIER: Thank--if I may, there are a number of us who've had some experience with this. So if we could work together, that would be great. 
SMITH: We'll bring the band together and we will figure this figure this out. 
SPEIER: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: All right, does anyone wish to--I'll yield to Ms. Speier. Go ahead. Sorry. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to recommend to my colleagues if you look on page 8 at line 19 and 20, nothing in this section may be construed as prohibiting a commanding officer from issuing or enforcing any other otherwise lawful order in the nature of a protective order to or against members of officers command. I might also add that VAWA is not complied with through the use of commanders filing these protective orders versus if you had a magistrate or military-- 
SMITH: --Reclaiming my time for a moment, that will be an outstanding thing to talk about further as--as we work on this issue. So I'll take a leap of faith here and say does anyone else wish to speak on this hearing none? All those in favor of the amendment will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: The ayes have it and as I said, the amendment is agreed to and we will work on this. And if we do not have the bipartisan agreement, I assure you I will not simply let it go forward. So I do appreciate the flexibility on that. Okay. 
And if anybody has a solution to the wearing a mask fogging up your glasses thing, go ahead and share that with the public. It is now in order to consider--I guess I can just look up there. Log 515. For what purpose does the gentle lady from New Jersey seek recognition? 
SHERRILL: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? And without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the chair recognizes Ms. Sherrill for the purpose of explaining her amendment. 
SHERRILL: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, when the administration brought out-of-state National Guard units to Washington, D.C., the attorney general later justified it through the use of Title 32 USC section 502-F2A, a provision addressing the training and duties of National Guard Title 32 units. This is a new interpretation of the vision provision and has some far reaching implications. 
When on duty, State National Guard units as Professor Vladeck from University of Texas says can really wear three hats, state active duty, these are state functions required by the state government and performed under state law, the second hat is often called Title 32 status. That's used under state command but for federal missions authorized by Congress and often paid for with federal funding. 
Finally, there is a Title 10 where State National Guards are federalized by the president under statutory authorities and full command and control is given to the Pentagon. There is the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits using the army and Air Force as a posse--posse comitatus or otherwise to execute in the laws. One thing the president can do is use the Insurrection Act if he wants to federalize the troops. That is an exception to this. Title 32 though has not generally been seen as that. 
So what my amendment does is state that--that that--the training provision in Title 32 cannot be used now as an end run around posse comitatus or the Insurrection Act. And it would require the consent of both the sending chief executive and the receiving chief executive, should the president request troops under Title 32. 
It doesn't restrict the president from activating Title 10 or invoking the Insurrection Act, it just ensures that the president or any president doesn't use the National Guard inappropriately. It also in no way changes the president's use of the D.C. Guard, which is an exception and always in the command and control of the president. So without--further, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Before recognizing someone else, there have been several questions about dinner. I--I don't think it is practical to sort of work through dinner because we may have second degree amendments coming up. So I will try to have a brief dinner break. It's not going to be long enough for like, you know--I'm talking like, half hour, 45 minutes, half hour. Let's stick with a half hour. 
The only thing is, I personally I'm from the West coast, so I eat late, so I don't know what--what time people would like to have that dinner break, so we're not going to have a public discussion about that, we'll have people ask, get a general consensus. I'm thinking 7--7:30-ish at the moment. If there is a strong push back here, I see shaking heads. Later? I'd go later. Earlier? Okay. 
We'll figure it out. I just said we weren't going to have a public debate about this. We are not. We'll talk about it. We'll talk, with a consensus here behind the scenes. And with that, I'll yield to Mr. Kelly to speak on Ms. Sherrill's amendment. 
KELLY: Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time. And I rise in opposition to Ms. Sherrill's amendment. I think well intentioned, but I think we have to be very careful, just like everything else when we respond to specific incidents and try to change the nature of law based on those significant specific incidents and what we thought could have happened or might have happened. 
This is--President Trump did not invoke the inspiration--Insurrection Act during the recent civil unrest. And the bad part of this is is although it's well intentioned and with good ideas for things we agree on, let me just give you an example of when this might have applied and we may not have been able to send Federal troops and the net result, although would have been popular with the jurisdiction that it was at the time was not the right thing to do. 
When James Meredith entered my alma mater, the University of Mississippi in 1962, he did so with Federal troops on the doorsteps in Oxford, Mississippi saying you will admit African Americans. This would prevent that from happening or it could prevent that from happening. It is not good to throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak. 
We need to make sure that when we take away the ability to use the Insurrection Act, we need to understand it is great to do that when you disagree with the commander in chief, but it is not when you are in full agreement. And so I also think that would have applied in Brown versus Board of Education. I want to say further, Mr. Chairman-- 
SHERRILL: --Would the gentleman yield? 
KELLY: Give me just a few seconds. Any initiative to alter the current statute an executive orders affecting the way the D.C. Guard is administered and employed could impact support to federal law enforcement agencies, IE the U.S. Marshal Service, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Secret Service and the District--District of Columbia. The need to defend the seat of the government of the United States is something that the president needs to have the authority to do. 
May have prevented use of National Guard in cases like Meredith versus University of Mississippi and Brown versus Board of Education. It could delay the deployment of National Guard in a time of sensitive situations, natural disasters, civil unrest where timeliness is of the essence. National Guard Bureau feels that there is no need for governor's consent if they are already in control of National Guardsmen under 32USC-502F. And with that, Ms. Sherrill, I'll--I'll be glad to yield a little bit of time. 
SHERRILL: Thank you, Mr. Kelly. This--this actually does not change anything to do with the president's use of the D.C. Guard. It doesn't touch upon that. He still has full control of that and he still has control of that National Guard under--if he federalizes them under Title 10 status. 
This just makes it clear, in fact this Title 32 situation use--which addresses training actually, has not been used and was not used in the situations you mentioned. So they--the governors and the president still would have been able to utilize the troops. And--and the problem here is that there was some use of these troops and some command authorities under Secretary Esper and the DOD, so it was not even clear who at all times was controlling the troops. 
This simply says if the president is going to use the troops, he does have to federalize them under Title 10. He has to make his proclamation, which is an exception to the Insurrection Act and still stands under this. This is simply clarifying that he does need to use them under Title 10 authority to federalize those troops if the president is going to utilize those troops. 
KELLY: And Mr. Chairman, I reclaim my time And I would just say that in the few seconds that I have left, we don't have an issue in that National Guard with being able to conduct and control this. It has never been an issue. Governors of states work together, have worked together, will continue. 
And there are times when States do not want to accept Guardsmen from other states and governors worked that out. We don't need to rewrite the law or change the law in order to do what we're already doing. Again, we're I think looking for a solution to a problem that does not exist, but the ramifications could be great if--if we do this. And with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Waltz. 
WALTZ: Ms. Sherrill, can I just yield for some clarification? Titled 32, the only difference in Title 32 and state active duty is at the that the federal government is picking up the bill. Operationally, state active duty, the governor's in control. Title 32, the governor is in control with the exception now that the federal government is picking up the bill. So I'm just confused a little bit on what you're proposing to change then versus what already currently exists. 
SHERRILL: So I think your confusion is why I've submitted this amendment because what the president did was controlled the troops and the troops were still entitled 32 status. He had not federalized the troops that he called to Washington. That National Guard troops were still under Title 32 status. 
So when asked why how is the president doing this, what is the authority to do this, Attorney General Barr said it was Title 32 under a provision addressing the training duties, which had never been utilized for this before. So this simply clarifies if the president is calling up troops, he does so under Title 10, which is the federalizing troops. This doesn't, again, touch the present president's authority to utilize The D.C. National Guard, which is under his control. 
WALTZ: Those--those troops in this situation that were sent were sent to support civil unrest or support law enforcement civil unrest and D.C. where the president has authority over the National Guard. So I think this is a unique kind of a bit of a donut hole situation-- 
SHERRILL: --He doesn't have--well if the gentleman will yield-- 
WALTZ: --But if this were going to Georgia to Florida, Title 32 to Title 32, those governors have to consent. 
SHERRILL: Those governors have to consent. The executive--executive has to consent. So for example, New Jersey sends troops down, National Guard troops to D.C. quite often for events and parades and that is under the, I think it's called the EMAC Authority. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which keeps them under Title 32. 
But this was a case of the president utilizing--calling in these Guards, and--and that had not been--he's not done that under Title 32. And I believe should be doing that under Title 10 if he's federalizing them, and that implicates the DOD's authority as well and puts them in control under commanded control of DOD. 
WALTZ: So you're suggesting then that those governors that sent troops did not consent and therefore we need to make sure-- 
SHERRILL: ---Under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, the mayor would have consented if the troops came in. The president still has the authority to call up the troops, but he'd have to do it under Title 10, which is--which allows him to--which is--which is a--what am I trying to say, a way that he is able to call up and federalized troops and not have problems with the Posse Comitatus Act. Because otherwise comment you can't federalize troops. It prohibits using the army and the Air Force by tradition the Navy and Marine Corps as posse comitatus or otherwise execute laws. 
WALTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I--I agree with my colleague, Mr. Kelly. I think--I think we are--we have a unique--we have a unique situation there in that the current law is sufficient. I yield. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Garamendi. 
GARAMENDI: Thank you. I want to-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry, Mr. Byrne. I looked at you, I yielded to Mr. Garamendi. That was a head fake. I apologize. I was letting you know that I saw you and I will get you, but Mr. Garamendi is up and then Mr. Byrne. 
GARAMENDI: Shall we flip a coin? 
SMITH: No. Go ahead, John. 
GARAMENDI: I really want to commend the committee here for release some fascinating and really good discussion about very, very important issues. And I found it enlightening and helpful. I'm curious about this particular amendment. Apparently we had a situation in which we had a Title 32 issue and I think the question that comes to my mind is under Title 32, the governors maintained control of the troops. 
Now, we had a unique situation because of the District of Columbia where the president controls the National Guard. However, we had state--other state National Guard apparently assigned to this situation. The question arises who then controls those National Guards from other states. And I think we have a command-and-control situation here that may--it certainly seems to trouble a lot of people. 
I think Ms. Sherrill is doing is trying to sort this out and to make it clearer that in a Title 32 situation--that we don't have a 32 situation here. There's another problem and we haven't really come to the heart of it, and that is the Insurrection Act and the other emergency acts that a president can utilize. I think there's some 20 or 30 different acts that a president can utilize to take control of a whole variety of things such as building walls on the border. 
It seems to me that it is in interest of to provide some clarity here on this situation. I am way out of my depth, but I know--but I perceive a serious problem that I think we're trying to solve with this amendment. I'll let it go at that. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Byrne 
GARAMENDI: I will yield to Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: And I will very quickly say that during this last process, Major General Walker, the commanding officer of the D.C. National Guard was in control of all troops, whether they were from Mississippi or Iowa or Texas or California. But Major General Walker was the authority who is in charge of all National Guardsman under Title--Title 32 when they came to DC. And I think that answers your question. 
GARAMENDI: So where does the attorney general fit in it? 
KELLY: The attorney general does not fit in. The adjutant general fits in who is the commander of Title 32 and other National Guard's soldiers in D.C. and other states. 
SMITH: Mr. Garamendi, will you yield for just a second? 
GARAMENDI: Of course. 
SMITH: You're referring to a different issue. There's a whole lot of things conflating here. The attorney general, I mean, in Washington, D.C. there are all manner of different law enforcement agencies, FBI being the most prominent, but as I learned a, you know, a handful of others as well that the attorney general is in charge of. You know, we got it real jurisdictional issue in that situation because you've got the attorney general in charge of a bunch of people and you've got DOD, and in this case, General Walker ultimately Secretary McCarthy, actually ultimately, you know, the Secretary of Defense in charge of that. That's a separate thing. 
What Ms. Sherrill is trying to get at is--is that Guard units I believe that were deployed from other states and sent into D.C. in support of that effort. So that that piece of it I think is sideways. But Mr. Byrne, you've been very patient and you are up. 
BYRNE: Thank you. I enjoyed the head fake. So I'm going to pose a hypothetical that's not a hypothetical. So we're talking about this in the case of protests or riots. Oftentimes, when the Guard is deployed, it's deployed in preparation for a response to a natural disaster. So the ones I'm most familiar with, unfortunately, are hurricanes. So we typically bring the Guard in before hurricanes to sort of help what we've got to do beforehand and then there are a major part of the response. 
Now typically, that's not a problem because the governor wants to do it, the governor does it. In Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana governor just blew it. Okay? Didn't have control over the situation And not only had chaos, you had hundreds of people dying. President Bush wanted to come in and she says I don't want you to come in. So he had a difficult decision to make. Do I force myself in here because people are dying, we don't know how bad the situation is, inside and outside the city or do I pull back? 
Well, he pulled back. And I understand that and I support his decision to do that. But I think we lost a lot of lives because of that. And so if we're going to require that here, we could have a future situation where you've got a president, and once again, take this president out of the picture for it a second. You've got a president who wants to come in you've got a governor who who's just blown it and he wants to, you know, bring in the troops. She wants to bring the troops to save lives and he--he won't be able to do it because the governor says no, I don't want you in here. So how do we deal with that under what you're talking about doing? 
SHERRILL: Would the gentleman yield? 
BYRNE: Absolutely. I want you to answer--answer the question. 
SHERRILL: He would do that under Title 10. He would federalize the troops, with them under his authority under Title 10 and declare that--that he's utilizing those under the Insurrection Act and utilized the troops as--as presidents have done in the past. So-- 
BYRNE: --But I'm struggling to find out what's the difference between--what does it matter whether it's under 10 or 32 from your perspective? 
SHERRILL: So from my perspective, Title 32 still has troops in a National Guard status. And if the president is going to use them, if he is going--you know, it's in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act unless he utilizes the Insurrection Act. Otherwise he's making an end run around a law that says you can't call up these troops to use them for law enforcement. 
Now the president can do that under the Insurrection Act, but that is not how we did at this time. And so I'm saying that's--that's a whole in this training provision in Title 32. It says training, but it has some very broad language for what that--that the president can pull them up. So that's what I'm trying to fix with this amendment. 
BYRNE: You want to put it under Title 10 so that it's under the restrictions of Title 10 but you don't think there are adequate restrictions under Title 32? 
SHERRILL: So where--where I think what we're doing is taking away a gaping hole in Title 32 that's never been utilized before--before this event. That's never how the president has called up troops. And so I do think if you want to federalize troops, you do that under titled then 10 authority. 
BYRNE: I'm just--I'm just--I'm sorry. I'm struggling the substantive difference is when they're--when they're federalized they're going to be paid by the federal government under Title 32 and they're going to be under the president authority under Title 32 because that's what the statute says. But if they're federalized and there still going to be under the president's authority and it's still going to be paid by the federal government and-- 
SHERRILL: --Well, you're using-- 
BYRNE: --I thought--I thought you were saying that you wanted them under Title 10 because you thought there were more appropriate restrictions for how they could be used under Title 10. 
SHERRILL: It's not really about restrictions. This doesn't change the traditional utilization of the troops. He simply has to enact the Insurrection Act and put them under his authority. Under the Title 32, troops--National Guard troops are not under the president's authority traditionally unless you're talking about the D.C. National Guard. Then those are under his authority. 
BYRNE: Taking my time back, this insurrection--Interaction Act won't work in a hurricane. We don't have an insurrection. We have people dying in the streets. And so--so we're going to say to the president, you can't use Insurrection Act. You can't go into Title 32, so you know if the governor doesn't want to do the governor's job, you as that president of the United States just have to let those people die in the streets. That happened in after Katrina in New Orleans. 
SHERRILL: And if he felt that if the president--so generally, the governor would allow troops in, right? Like I'm not saying that happened in Katrina, but generally, I know in Superstorm Sandy we had national troops come in And the governor called the troops in. 
BYRNE: Right. 
SHERRILL: If there is a situation where the president feels there is a problem of law, then I do think that that the president has to use the inspiration Insurrection Act. I do think that doing that-- 
BYRNE: --Taking my time back, I'm sorry I'm going to lose my time. I'd just take my time back. You can't use this Insurrection Act after a hurricane, after a natural disaster. You have to have the governor to-- 
SMITH: --That gentleman's time has--has expired-- 
BYRNE: --If the governor won't do it, we have American citizens die. 
SMITH: Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: We could spend literally the next six hours debating amendments related to the recent protests whether it's Guard, Insurrection Act, or whatever. Here's my thought. We're going to have a hearing a week from tomorrow with the Secretary of Defense and Chairman Milley to talk about Department of Defense and civilian support to civilian authorities where all of these issues can be discussed. 
And--and I think it's important to have a discussion of these issues rather than have amendment ever amendment related to these--these protests without having the benefit of that examination and discussion. So the more we can save this stuff for next week, ask the Secretary of Defense about it, there may be some gaping holes that we want to bring in the form of floor amendments and other things, which--which we still have an opportunity to do. But on the other hand, we could spend six hours going through this stuff and I'm just not sure that that's in the best interest of this committee. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Just--I think it really is important that we have the hearing that we're going to have next week and we really dive into these issues and how they play out. And now, I do understand that you know it's our jurisdiction this is when we markup our bill and, we--we need to get--we can't markup the bill after that testimony, so I you know I support this amendment. I approve it going forward. 
I do think as we look at this stuff when we get into conference how to put this exactly, our current president has a unique way of saying things and doing things. And I think a lot of what he said didn't actually pan out in what actually happened and as we try to sort of executive proof this approach, that's going to be difficult. 
The president has authority in a variety of different ways, and that's going to be what we are we're going to try to sort of work our way through here. You know, we want to stop a president from abusing his authority. That that's difficult without the then stopping, as Mr. Byrne pointed out the situations where we want him to use that authority. I'm not saying it's going to be impossible, I'm just saying it's not something we're likely to resolve in the next couple of hours and I support the effort to try and get our arms around it. I think the hearing next week will be helpful. 
I think as we move in--onto the floor to debate further amendments and debate our bill once we get there and then enter conference, I think it's important that we look at these questions. And we wanted to make sure that, we--we use the law appropriately protect people (INAUDIBLE) protected but we do want to make sure also that the executive doesn't abuse that power. So I will support Ms. Sherrill's amendment. Do we have anybody else who wishes to speak on this one? Yes, Ms. Luria. 
LURIA: Thank you, Mr. Chair for allowing me time to speak and I believe that some additional discussion of this would--would be beneficial, so I'm going to yield my time to Ms. Sherrill. 
SHERRILL: Thank you. I don't need any extra time unless there's--I'm sorry, thank you, Elaine, but unless there's more questions on the bill--the amendment. 
BROWN: Mr. Chairman? Over here, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Mr. Brown 
BROWN: Yeah, thank you. I just you know, I have to speak. It's less to the merits of the bill, but we've just heard on a number of occasions today that we're acting as if we're doing from the seat of our pants and we haven't had hearings on this. We have had hearings. On--on the 8th of this month we had a hearing Department of Defense authorities in roles related to civil unrest. 
Now, keep in mind that often we have hearings and even those hearings don't cover the entirety of the topics that we bring to markup and that we debate. But to suggest that we haven't had a hearing on this, we haven't heard from--from others, I just think is wrong and it's something that we've been hearing throughout the course of this markup on a number of occasions. So I just, Mr. Chairman, wanted to remind my colleagues that we did have a hearing, a public hearing on--on this issue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Thank you. All right, there are no further debate, all those in favor of the amendment offered by Representative Sherrill will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it. A roll call has been requested. We will suspend further consideration of this amendment and roll the vote on to the end of the process. 
Before we move on to the next one, dinner. It is my thought, as I've heard some feedback here, no one is going to want to eat at the same time, so I would just as soon not to do a dinner break. Now, if a second degree amendment comes up, something like that comes up, we will again hold it over. We will not cut anyone out because they happen to have chosen that moment to go get dinner. Otherwise, you know, we're going to be breaking but we're not really going to be accomplishing anything. 
So we're going to roll forward and you may eat as you see fit. And if a vote comes up, we will make sure that we let you get back for that vote. I would urge you not to go too terribly far, but you may eat when you see fit. 
So it is now in order to consider, sorry, and they gave me a new sheet here and I've got to find my place. It's better to look up there. Log number 227-R1. For what purpose does the gentlelady from California seek recognition? 
SPEIER: (OFF-MIC) 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. And Ms. Speier is recognized for the purposes of explaining her amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Log 227 is an amendment to establish a pilot program at the military service academies to have a chief prosecutor make binding referrals on special victims offenses to the superintendent. This amendment was successfully voted on by this committee and included in the last year House-passed NDAA taken out in conference. 
At the academies, the prevalence of sexual assault has skyrocketed. Increasing by 70 percent for women and nearly tripling for men since 2014. In the 2014, 2015 academic years, 16.8 percent of female cadets and midshipmen had experienced sexual assault during their time at the Academy, rising to 28.5 percent in 2018-2019. For males, this figure increased from 2.11 percent to 5.8 percent. And while reporting has increased from 180 to 130 annual reports over that time period, more than one third are restricted reports. Thus, the perpetrator cannot be held accountable and many more assaults are never reported. 
This amendment offers a bold step to address the problem but does so in a careful way that it will allow us to learn and inform future policy. In that military justice system, commanders are responsible for deciding whether to try cases. This responsibility can create tremendous conflicts of interest between the commander's responsibility for the survivor accused and the unit. 
My longstanding belief based on research and countless discussions with survivors is that if experienced, unbiased prosecutors made prosecution decisions instead of commanders, more survivors would come forward and trust in the military justice system would increase. This amendment would test this hypothesis by creating a pilot program at the service academies. An officer of the chief prosecutor headed by a general flag officer would make binding prosecution recommendations on special victims cases to the academy superintendents. 
Over four years, Congress and the Military could evaluate the results. Since the academies are non-operational educational institutions, there would be no impact on readiness. But since cadets and midshipmen are in the age group at greatest risk for sexual assault, we could reliably test the model. 
The chief prosecutor would not weaken the power or responsibility of superintendents. The superintendent's will still be responsible for convening courts martial, setting policy and standards, holding individuals accountable through non judicial punishment, and leading their staffs. We owe it to our service members to try innovative solutions to eradicate the scourge of sexual violence once and for all. 
The DOD's current efforts are not working. I can't say that strongly enough. They are not working. My amendment offers a way to test a potential solution without disrupting the act of force and I urge you to support it. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Turner is recognized. 
TURNER: I have a perfecting amendment. Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? 
TURNER: Okay, again-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry, without objection, we'll dispense with reading the amendment, the gentleman's recognized to discuss his amendment. Alright. Sorry. 
TURNER: Thank you. Again, let me begin with my great appreciation for Congress--Congresswoman Speiers' dedication to the issue of sexual assault in the military, which is an absolute travesty and an incredibly important issue for us to take up. 
Citing the problem is not a justification for every solution or every idea that comes forward. The issue of removing the chain of command has actually already legislatively been addressed by this body. We already changed the process for the chain of command previously. But although Congresswoman Speier went down the road of, we should change the chain of command, her pilot program doesn't really accomplish that military wide, but it clearly is a precept for commencing that. 
Which again, we've already deliberated on, and we already decided not to do and decided to change it in a real reform manner, where we're now waiting to see how that reform is implemented and what its--its causes are. But--but in this particular one. This came forward, previously-- and Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, your microphone's open. Someone's microphone's open. 
I hope that doesn't come out of my time. 
SMITH: No, it'll be-- it'll be fine. Go ahead. 
TURNER: Thank you. 
Congressman Speier brought this one before this body and preview--and in conference, it was changed to a study. The study is ongoing. The study is supposed to come back in October. Why would we as a deliberative body say this is an important issue enough for us to study, and then go ahead and jump ahead of the study and say, well, we don't need to really wait to the results of the study, we'll just do it anyway. 
I mean, we're so close to the study being completed, that it would-- it would just supplant, really, any processes that we have as a deliberative body to actually seek information and have oversight and engage in receiving information for our decision making. 
Now, the legislation that was adopted that asked for a study for this, which is due in October, didn't require that if they come back and say this is not a good idea, which is possible. I mean, imagine if we adopt this amendment and then October, they deliver their report and say, don't do this, do X instead. Well, we will already have done it. 
But what I'm asking to do in my perfecting amendment is, since we already asked for a study, the one thing we didn't do in this study is we didn't ask them, if you do come back and say that Congresswoman Speier's solution should not be adopted, tell us why. And so, my perfecting amendment changes back her amendment and says, we're gonna wait. We're gonna wait till we get the study back that we asked for last time. 
We're not going to make our previous action meaningless by jumping ahead. And we're further going to say, by the way, if you do come back and say that her recommendation is not the idea to pursue, we're going to demand that you tell us why. And so, we set forth the requirements and the details as to what their response should be for us. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. We have debated this issue a number of times and I believe we-- I know, we included it in the mark last year, went into conference committee, and the result of Mr. Turner described is--is what we came out. So, I guess, I would ask Ms. Speier, and I apologize, we got, sort of, compressed here in this conversation. I was-- I should have had before then, but what is the feeling about taking another bite to this particular apple in this situation, given last year's outcome? 
SPEIER: So, Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question. Actually, the study that was put into the NDA last year, was a broader study of the entire military justice system. It did not specifically look at sexual assault. This amendment is going to test a better way of prosecuting sex-- sexual assaults in the academies. And I just can't underscore enough the fact that the numbers at the academies are growing exponentially, from 16 percent, to 21 percent, to 28 percent in the course of four years. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: Yeah. If I may amend my comment, sorry. I know the outcome last year was not what we wanted. We--we--we did have this debate last year and fought our way through it. And--you know, I'm very ambivalent on this, as you know. I see the wisdom of moving in this direction and I also see the challenges. 
The outcome is unlikely to be different once we get into conference this year, just so everybody knows. I've got Ms. Sherrill, and then Ms. Luria, and then Mr. Bergman and Conway. Ms. Sherrill. 
SHERRILL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a woman who went to the academy in the early 90s, I can tell you that the people that I knew that were sexually assaulted, were many. There is a chat group now of women that were assaulted while at the service academies. Service women actions networker Swan had an op ed in the New York Times that I found very disturbing several years ago, talking about the still high rate of sexual assault at the academies. 
I was recently at a--a college assault discussion at the Naval Academy and still hearing the stories that I heard 20--over 20 years ago. And the fact that between 2014 and--and 2019, assaults increased by 70 percent for female cadets and midshipmen, and I am hearing that we need to wait. I am sick of waiting. I am done waiting on this issue. 
The fact that I am still hearing, I am sending women from my district to a place where I am hearing that over 16 percent of them are getting assaulted, we have got to do better. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Conaway. 
CONAWAY: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I couldn't agree more with the previous speaker. I serve with the Board of Visitors with West Point. And for the last six years, this has been the first topic on every Board of Visitors meeting, is sexual assault. The fact that we have any sexual assault or harassment on our campuses with the best and the brightest this nation has to offer, is stunningly frustrating. It should be zero in that arena. 
The--the statistics are not all that different at the--the academies than they are at the colleges, written large across the United States, but that's no excuse either. Part of those driven statistics is that reporting is better. The stigma attached with reporting is being addressed constantly, so that men and women both feel comfortable coming forward in presenting their case and helping that understanding. 
Part of the issue on those rise is everything is counted. Whether it's a joke that should not have been told, that makes somebody uncomfortable, gets counted, as well as--you know, forcible rape. And so, be careful with the statistics. But the fact that we have any of this happening on our campuses is just unacceptable on every single level. And it's really frustrating for those of us on the Board of Visitors to see the extent it is going on. 
We had an extensive conversation last meeting about the character development on our campuses. Character development process was totally devoid of morals and any kind of a religious standard that would argue as to why you would do things right or wrong. It's focused on the rules and it's clearly not working, in that regard. 
And so all of that said--you know, this is a--this is a different deal. I know the statistics that they were cited are startling, but we ought--we need to understand--understand the underlying gravity of all of those cases that are going forward. So, it is being addressed every single day. The Superintendent of West Point thinks this is a big deal and they work at it. 
So, I--I know we're criticizing this kind of going on in our academy academies, but the leadership, the cadre, they are working their very best to--to try to put in place the right reporting processes, the right positions, so that men and women who are suffering from this conduct can come forward with any sense of retribution or risks to their own future prospects, so that we get everything reported. But we do a better job of reporting today, I believe, than five and six years ago, that they help drive some of that increase. 
And with that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Ms. Luria. 
LURIA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like Ms. Sherrill, I'm also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. I'm now on the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Naval Academy. And last year when we sat in this hearing, I was one of the people, as a former commanding officer, who resisted this idea. I thought that it was essential to the chain of command, that the commanding officer would retain the ability to make these decisions. But as I've sat here through these hearings that, thank you, Ms. Speier, you have hosted in the Military Personnel Subcommittee. 
As I've listened to the resistance to change, that I feel, that I sense, within the leadership at the Naval Academy. I feel that when we're briefed as the Board of Visitors, we are just repeatedly told stories of how the academy's patting themselves on their back. And no disrespect Mr. Conway, for your position on the board at West Point, but I think that they really haven't woken up and faced the facts. 
And what changed for me is the same thing that Ms. Sherrill said, is one of my roommates from the Naval Academy reached out to me and said, Elaine, have you seen this social media group? There are 2,000 women who are graduates of the service academies over--over the last 40-plus years who are in this group, and the stories that are being told of the things that happened to these women, while they went there, as patriots to serve our country, are just heart wrenching and we have to do something different. 
Therefore, I speak in strong support of Ms. Speier's amendment this year, because I think we finally have to do something different about this problem. We have to try something different, because what we have been doing is not working. 
And I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Bergman. 
BERGMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a painful discussion for everybody. Whether you're the person who's been sexually assaulted, or you're--you're the parent. I'll leave it at that. 
55 years ago, I swore an oath at the Coast Guard Academy as a cadet. I know what academy life is like. I spent about a year there and then decided to move on. But good order and discipline begins day one when you check into any unit, whether that unit is your boot camp, whether it's your academy, whether it's--wherever it happens to be. And if we are ever, ever going to get control of this absolutely abhorrent situation, we have to start day one within the structure. And if we have to change the fact that if it continues, that commanders at all the academies get relieved immediately, then by God you do it. Nobody gets a pass. Nobody. 
The first day these young men and women come into a service academy, they begin to understand what it is like in the military, when it comes to chain of command, assigned to a unit, mission orientation. To begin to separate anything out, I believe, will in the end, diminish the capabilities of those individuals who are going to be our leaders to defend our country, both here and abroad. 
So, we've got a tough situation here to deal with it. But we have to deal with it. And, I guess, now, I'm kind of talking as a as a marine. If you don't--if you don't take control and take command in your own unit, there's no higher headquarters and any other entity than--that can get you out of a jam that you put yourself into. 
So, it's about holding the commanders accountable. We did last year, ask for a study. I agree with Mr. Turner, that we--we don't want to jump the gun and do something that we wish we hadn't done. We are very close. 
So, I would urge my colleagues at this point, to oppose the amendment, because we are closer than we believe. But the sensing that we give as Congress, to the Department of Defense, about how serious this is, we have to do it in such a way that cannot be misconstrued, or lessened, or felt it can be messed with. 
So, I want to see the service academies do the right thing here, because they are the future of our leaders in the military. And we have to understand that the young men and women who come there will be the best because we will hold ourselves, as the leaders, to the highest standards, and we will be the example to which they expire. No exceptions. 
And with that, I yield back. 
SPEIER: Thank you. Mr. Brown. You are next. 
BROWN: Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, I send the fifth most number of women I nominate to the service academies, among all the members of Congress, House and Senate. If you rank us all, I send the fifth most number of women. And I'm proud of those women and I'm concerned about their welfare when they go to the service academies. 
You know, sexual assault and harassment is one of, if not the most, egregious offenses I can think of. It's vile and depraved in any scenario, any setting, and among anybody. But as I said, last year in this committee, we're talking about a family. We're talking about men in uniform assaulting women in uniform, and our commanders are failing us, and they are failing the family. 
So, last year in conference, we said okay, we'll study it. But that's not what this amendment is about. This amendment isn't about commanders in every command. This is about the service academies. Sexual assault and harassment is on the rise across the force. And it's rising at an even faster rate in the service academies. It's not because of beta reporting. It's because of more assaults. 
The superintendent and the commandant are no different than a college president and a provost. They do not have the same relationship with cadets and midshipmen as the CENTCOM commander has with his troops, or the INDOPACOM commander has with his troops. This is where we should pilot this transformation. 
It was said earlier in this committee, during a--during another amendment about a sexual assault, that over 10 years we've been diligent. Another quote, we've made a mountain of changes, yes, but we haven't made the progress that men and women deserve in the force. So, what better place to pilot this? 
At the service academy, where you have a high rate of sexual assault and change in the relationship with Superintendents and Commandant who don't have the same command relationship as out there in the force. As much as I respect the experience of the members in this committee who have been in uniform service, I can tell you that a cadet at West Point doesn't think about who's referring him to court martial or not, or who potentially could. And somehow that's going to shape his understanding about command relationships when he gets out into the force. 
We're creating the office of a chief prosecutor, if the Superintendent, the Commandant don't like their results, than this amendment allows them to appeal to the department. It's five years; it's a pilot. Let's not feel good about the things we've done to make it easier to report or to require training. We are not making progress. Commanders are failing us, and we are failing commanders in the force. 
Let's not be comfortable that we're passing some feel good legislation. This is not the fix for all of the sexual assault and sexual harassment in the force. But I can tell you right now, it's probably the boldest thing that we can do. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SPEIER: Thank you, appreciate that. Your time is up. Mr. Bacon. 
Thank you. 
BACON: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to thank Chairwoman Speier too, for her leadership here. We're saying we need to do something. And I agree. 
And we've been doing a variety of things. You know, I--when I was a five time commander, my philosophy was the safe to report philosophy of something that I--I applied in my own commands. And now I'm on the Board for the Air Force Academy. I was there when they made that their policy, and I support Chairwoman Speier doing this for the entire DOD, because I think it's the right thing to do. 
I--doing something can take us backwards and cause unintended effects. There can, in the military, be only one chain of command. If you add an outside prosecutor, you by definition, have two change commands, with maybe contradictory policies undermining each other. And I think you only have one chain of command across the board for each unit. 
I've had personal experiences with myself, as a five time commander, I've had to deal with these situations. In one of my commands, I was in charge of the well--well-being and welfare, the--the discipline of 55,000 people. When I came in, we had one of the worst sexual assault rates in the entire military, and we had to turn it around. 
And I came up with a program within about two or three weeks, applied it for months. And by the time we were done, we had one of the best sexual assault programs in the entire Air Force. In fact, we won the Best Sexual Assault Response Program in the Air Force. 
Now, how would I have done that if I had an outside prosecutor with a different philosophy? How would I have done this if it--if they would have had a counter policy than me? You can only have one chain of command. I use that chain of command from a worst to bust. And it can be done. 
I just want to close; I've known some of the superintendents in our academies. I'll just give you one example. General Silveria. I could tell you there's no one more dedicated than he, to wanting to beat this. One sexual assault grief--grieves him more than anything out there. 
No prosecutor can fill his shoes with his heart and his intent. So, let's respect the chain of command. I agree we got to do something, but this will take us backwards. I believe. 
I yield. 
SMITH: Ms. Escobar. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I'd--I'd like to thank Chairwoman Speier for her relentlessness on this, and so many issues, as they relate to women and families. I did not--I'm not part of the military. I did not attend an academy, but I know for certain that we have a serious, serious problem and the status quo cannot be allowed to remain. 
I understand that there is a study. I understand that--that there are processes, time honored processes. But--you know, we are failing our women in so many ways, women who have stepped up with courage to serve their country, and we owe them more than just a study. 
I don't know if you all have heard about Vanessa Guillen, at Fort Hood. Obviously, this is not a service academy story. But a young woman who wanted to serve her country who has gone missing and who--who--remains had been found near Fort Hood and her family was here today. 
She reported to her family that one of her colleagues walked in, followed her into a shower. But she did not want to report that. This is so pervasive, that we really need to do something other than the status quo. 
And so, Chairwoman Speier, this is a pilot program. I think if we want to change things, if we want to do better by the women who stand up to serve, we have to create meaningful reform, meaningful change. And Chairwoman Speier, I support your amendment. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: (OFF-MIC) 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Brown, I am proud. I am proud of the fact that over 10 years we have adopted unbelievable legislation that has made an absolute difference to protect men and women. And by the way, this is not a gender issue. More men are raped in the military than women. Men and women who serve in the military. 
Today, if you come forward and say that you're accused, that you're going--or you accuse someone of sexual assault, you get a--you get assigned a lawyer, and that lawyer has standing in court to represent you. And we did that. I--I fought to bring that forward and we adopted that in the military-adopted rules. 
And today, unprecedented, the non-party to the--to the criminal action has a lawyer by their side. We've adopted provision after provision to do three things: prevention, protection, and prosecution. And in every one of those, we've done tremendous work. 
Now, we're not done. We are not done, but we cannot become a deliberative body where just because we say that there is a problem, that any solution is to be adopted. We're deliberative body. This is not just anecdotal story after anecdotal story and then therefore boom, let's go pass this. 
What we did last year, as a deliberative body, was pass in this provision, which you all voted for, every one of us. We all voted for, yes, by the way, sexual assault is included to be studied. And the study is this, an assessment of the feasibility and advisability of conducting a pilot program to assess the feasibility advisability of the alternate military justice system for our--for exactly what this provision is that's offering, and it's due in October. 
Why would we, all of us voted for this, why would we all say, let's do--let's have a study that's come--give us--we don't even--what if it says, do this, but this should be done differently this way? What if it says don't do this at all and gives us a great reason that every one of us could say? 
Now, we could all say it. I mean, I could throw my heart on the table and say, this is absolutely outrageous that we have any sexual assaults at all. And--but that doesn't mean that every provision that every member bring forward should just be blindly adopted. And then we should just blindly say that--that one is too many. Therefore, let's adopt everything that we bring forward. 
Let's not abandoned the deliberative process that we have as a body. We're a legislative body. This is a judicial criminal system. This is not just--just a training program. This is a criminal judicial system. 
We've currently asked the military to give us the best information as to how and whether or--and to undertake a pilot program for a criminal judicial system. Why would we not wait for the answer? That's not saying delay and that--that--because it certainly is not, even if you adopt this pilot system, this isn't a prevention provision. This is a prosecution provision. 
Like the three different ones we've done. We've done prevention, protection, and prosecution. This is just on prosecution. Not one person is going to be protected by this after it's adopted. But yet we could, because we asked for a study, jump ahead and say, we don't need to hear the study, we can just give each other our own anecdotal stories as to how we're all moved, which we all are, and how we are all convinced, and committed that this is an atrocity. 
And it is, but that doesn't mean that we should just adopt whatever's in front of us. My perfecting amendment says, this study is ongoing. If you come back and tell us not to do this. You have to tell us why. Because if they tell us why, then we can decide whether we adopt a modified version of what Mr. Speier has brought forward. 
And I--I hope that you all will adopt the perfecting amendment because this is a travesty of an issue. But we ought, not every year, just have anecdotal stories and adopt whatever provision comes forward. We for--we have adopted provisions that are--have unbelievable ingenuity and have unbelievable groundbreaking effects to protect those who are accused, and to protect the accusers, and to prosecute those who are accused. Let's not abandon that now. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Garamendi? 
GARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We've talked a lot about a lot of things, with regard to sexual assault here. Two women who have been in the academy spoke to this issue. It's their experience that compels me to say, we need to do what Ms. Speier has suggested. 
And therefore, we ought not delay, as Mr. Turner has suggested. We ought not delay, any more, a strong resolution to this. And therefore I oppose the perfecting amendment, and I yield the balance of my time to Ms. Speier. 
SPEIER: I thank the gentleman for yielding. Let me first say, to Congresswoman Luria, how powerful your statement was, what courage it took for you to come forward and say what you said today. And to Congresswoman Sherrill, thank you for your comments. 
I have been working on this issue for 10 years and I resent the fact that Mr. Turner thinks that this is just anecdotal. We don't agree, Mr. Turner. I recognize--no, I will not yield. 
TURNER: Of course not. Of course not. You're going to attack me but you're not gonna--you're not going to-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Turner, I'm sorry, she controls--she controls the time. You had your time. This is her time. She can use it as she see fit--sees fits. Ms. Speier. 
SPEIER: Thank you. This has been with us. It has not improved. We've thrown all kinds of money at SAPRO and every imaginable program. The one thing that has worked well is creating the SVC's. That has worked well. 
But I must tell you, that I have spent so much time meeting with victims in the academies, that are wounded and scarred, because the system is not working for them. And these are our best and our brightest. And if you can see an increase of assault, we're talking rape, assault that goes from 16 percent to 28 percent in our academies, that's almost a third. 
Now, I must tell you how painful it is for me, every time I nominate a woman to one of the academies, that I have to take her aside with her parents and tell her that we have a problem. And if anything ever happens to her, that she has to call me. That's where we are at? And we think that's okay? 
And this study is not about a pilot program or sexual assault in the military. It is a pilot. It is a study to look at the military justice system. And we know what studies are all about. Studies are all about killing ideas. This is a pilot project. It's at the academies where we have seen an increase that is unbelievable. And I don't want another female cadet, or another female midshipmen to be scarred, when we want them to be the leaders of tomorrow. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. I think, on this issue, what we're talking about is, is making the bold step that has been debated many times. And that is the issue of whether or not the existing command structure can do the adequate job of making decisions about investigating sexual assaults. 
Right now, the command structure is what has that authority. And--you know, the issue is unbelievably important, as has been stated, better than I could've possibly stated. But I want to focus on what Ms. Speier's amendment does, which is to take outside of command and set up a separate organization, or a separate authority within the military, to directly address military assault. 
Now, this is a bold step. I think it is a bold step that we need to take. The only--the only ambivalence I have, is this the place to take it? And I think it is. I think the(PH) statistics in the academy sort of show, that if you're going to give this a try, this sort of makes sense. And I think it's important. 
We've had proposals in the past, by the way, which we've debated, to take the command structure completely out of it within all of DOD, and set up a separate authority within the military, to handle sexual assaults. Which we have not done, because that that is a significant change to the UCMJ. 
This is a piece of the DOD, that we want to say, let's take a look and see if this works. And under the circumstances, as everything has been explained, I think it is worth it to--and I supported this last year, the Senate did not, and that's where we wound up with the study. The study was not some sort of carefully thought out effort that says, well, let's look at this. It was a disagreement. We wanted to do this, the Senate didn't, and that's where we wound up. 
I think this is worth trying, for all the reasons that have been stated. We're not doing a DOD wide, and we're doing it just in the academies, and if it turns out that this actually does improve how this is handled, then I think we'll all be very happy that we learned that, and we can look at where we can expand it. 
I think as a pilot project, this--this does, in fact, make sense going forward. Mr. Mitchell. 
MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll be brief. I think the academies are step--there are--they're different. They're different than a standard military unit. In a process of transition to be medical--be military leaders. 
I have daughters. And the statistics from the academies told me a great deal. We've not made adequate progress, in my opinion. 
So, to the dismay, I'm sure of, a number of people in this side of the aisle, I--and I'm sure to Ms. Speier's amazement, because I've disagreed on some other things. I'll support her amendment because I think we need to try to do something different to distill the kind of accountability to our future leaders to expect more of their peers, their compatriots, to keep all members of military safe from sexual assault of any--of sexual harassment. And I wanted to explain that because I'm sure it will cause some dismay over here. 
Thank you. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. And lastly, we have Ms. Davis. 
DAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and--and to everyone who has spoken, and appreciate everybody's passion in this area. One story I would tell--and I remember, I was with Ms. Speier when we went to the Air Force Academy, that--that has really stayed with me. A young man who got up and said to us, I've always wanted to come here. I've dreamed about it. It's something that I believed I could follow in the footsteps of an uncle, I believe. And my mother was so worried that if I came here, I would be hurt because of the situation of being bullied here at the Academy. 
And I think that--you know, we really have to take that to heart, that the parents who send their children, wanting them to be so successful, have to worry about these things. And that's exactly what happens when families send their--their--their young women on to be there as well. 
So, this isn't just about them. It's also about our country. And we always have to be aware of that. The thing that--I supported this, when Ms. Speier brought it forward last time and we've had some differences of opinion about how to get to the heart of this. 
What concerns me about it, is number one, we're always looking for silver--silver bullets. And we know there are no silver bullets. If there was a silver bullet, we would have found it some time ago. One silver bullet is, of course, having women follow up the chain of their profession, and be at the very top of the military. That would certainly change the feelings of some people that join. 
But given what we need to focus on today, I think that what Mr. Turner was trying to do, I understand, we've worked hard together, that report is going to come out and that probably could inform us in some way. And we ought to take that seriously and take a look at it. 
But I also think we need to--we need to move forward with a pilot. But what concerns me, is that whenever you do a study, as everybody well knows, you--you build a certain amount of bias in it just by the fact that you're doing that. If you give people placebos, that's going to have a different impact than if you give them a non-placebo. 
And so--so, what--what happens in this study is going to be really critical and important. And I don't know how much influence the committee can have on understanding what they're trying to get at in this study. So, I think it'd be great to for people to be a little more informed about that. What is this--how does the study try to get to this issue? 
Because you--you certainly don't want to--you want to stop a study in the middle of it, if you notice that it's doing harm. And if you notice that it's not doing harm, then maybe you--you escalate it, maybe you include more people in the study, whatever that may be. I just think that I would build some flexibility into that, and I haven't heard anybody talking about. 
So, in the end, I think--you know, I see--I see that this argument is bringing in-- you know, two--two different points of view. And yet, in a way, we're, we're basically, hopefully, gonna utilize both of them to a certain extent, although I don't think that we need to actually adopt Mr. Turner's amendment, perfecting amendment, but we take advantage of the fact that it's out there. 
SMITH: Thank--thank you. 
DAVIS: Yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Wilson. 
WILSON: (OFF-MIC) 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. and I just want to make one point that--that I think is important. Many times, when we bring up an issue that we don't know enough about, or what its effects will be, we will ask for a study. And some concerns are raised, obviously, that that could be a delay. 
We're not asking that Congresswoman Speier's amendment be translated into a study. There is an ongoing study. The ongoing study is due in October We're, instead we're like, totally delegitimizing the process of the committee asking for a study. 
Now, what's interesting, because I started reading it, and I'm going to just give you a couple more provisions of this, that this ongoing study is asking--is reviewing an assessment of the feasibility of a pilot program, and that it includes sexual assault. Here's one of the provisions that we're asking them to study, and this is really important. An analysis of the potential legal issues in connection with the pilot program, including potential issues for appeals. 
Meaning, that we could establish a pilot program that in effect could undermine someone else's due processes, rights, and undo a whole conviction because we did it wrong. That's why when we ask for a study, we wait for it. I'm not asking for delay so that we can do a study, I'm just pointing out, we're doing a study. It's due this year in October. For goodness sakes, since we're affecting something that's constitutional rights and that could affect convictions, we should at least wait for the study. 
With that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. 
TURNER: Oh, I'm sorry. I yield (INAUDIBLE) 
CONAWAY: --Just quickly, Mr. Chairman. The evidence-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Conaway. Mr. Conaway. I'm sorry, I've not actually recognized you yet. I'm sorry, I apologize, but Mr. Carbajal had his hand up as well. So, I want to get to Mr. Carbajal-- 
CARBAJAL: Thank you. 
SMITH: Mr. Carbajal, go ahead. 
CARBAJAL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, this is my fourth in the NDAA and it seems that every year we have the same discussion. The statistics speak for themselves. We are failing, our commanders are failing. And to do any more studying just means delay. That's all it means is delay. Delay until it comes out. 
The fact of the matter is that sexual assault is pervasive in our service academies. And enough is enough. We got to take action. And I think the amendment put forth by Representative Speier takes that first step. First viable step, to finally address this. 
If we're gonna wait for another study, we might as well just wait 10 years. The statistics are glaring at us about the failure of our commanders in the service academy for our cadets, our female cadets going through those academies. And we have to stop with this inaction. 
Representative Speier gives us a path to finally take a step forward. And again, we're caught up in a debate about, let's study this. The statistics don't change. They only get worse. And our female cadets are the ones that are suffering the brunt of inaction. Not just at those institutions, but by us here in Congress and on this committee. 
I am moved by Ms. Speier, Ms. Sherrill, and Ms. Luria, their courage to call this what it is. This is an epidemic of sexual assault against women in the service academies. And again, we're having a conversation about, let's study it, it's gonna come out in a few months. Hey, maybe, maybe before next year. 
The fact of the matter is when do we do the NDAA? We do it once a year. So, before we take concrete, substantive action, it may come out in two or three months, Representative Turner, but you're basically saying let's wait another year. Let's call it what it is. It's another year. 
And then next year, we'll have this discussion again, and somebody will make a perfected amendment about how we should wait because there's gonna be another study. But the fact of the matter is, we are failing. And unless we take action and support Ms. Speier's amendment today, we're not fulfilling our obligation and our responsibilities as members of Congress on this House committee. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Conaway. 
CONAWAY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would point out that whatever the statistics are on sexual assault and harassment on our--in our campuses are horrific and terrible. That's not what this is about. Stopping it, preventing it, not letting it happen, let's go there. 
What this is about is what happens after it's happened, after it's already occurred. And--and the proponents have not presented any evidence at the prosecution phases at the academies have failed. The prosecutors--the statistics there. So, I understand how heart wrenching--heart wrenching it is to have the cases that go--happen and all that, but we've not established the fact that actual prosecution, once women and men come forward, and they are coming forward more readily now than ever, that somehow those cases are being mishandled or handled improperly. 
And so, this is a ready, fire, aim. 
And I yield back. 
SMITH: Question will occur on the substitute amendment offered by Mr. Turner. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair, the noes have it. The noes have it. The amendment is defeated. 
The question now occurs on the underlying amendment offered by Ms. Speier. All those in favor will say aye. Aye. Opposed will say no. In opinion of the chair, the aye's have it. 
SPEIER: Roll call, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: The roll call has been requested. Therefore, further proceedings in this amendment is suspended until the end. And it is now in order. Sorry. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman. Mr. Thornberry. I just mentioned, or according to my account, we've got 11 more debates ahead of us. 
You know, we had talked earlier about going to five minutes, and three minutes beyond that, maybe it's time to think about that, as these debates get a little protracted, because if we take as much time on future amendments as we have on that one, it's gonna be a while. 
SMITH: Yeah. Sorry. So, what Mr. Thornberry's talking about, we had discussed earlier, limiting the debate time to five minutes for--you know, keep the five minutes for whoever offers it one person in opposition, but then limit it to three minutes for all subsequent speeches after that. 
So, that's what we're proposing, just to be clear, again. Yes, Mr. Scott. 
SCOTT: Mr. Chairman, I'm not opposed to that. But I would point out, that the--with respect to the author of the last Amendment, which I voted for, she won and requested the roll call vote. If the--if the winning side doesn't request the roll call votes, then we-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry. That's a different thing. That's--yeah, I mean, that's--that's a matter of whether or not you want to be on the record on the issue. I'm talking about the time of the debate, leading up to it. I mean, that gets into how long we're going to take at the end, to go through the vote, but that's--and that that's every members right, to have a roll call vote. 
And you raised this issue to save time. Mr. Gaetz. 
GAETZ: Mr. Chairman for a parliamentary inquiry. Is the is the chair concerned that if we limit to three minutes there--there will merely be more acquisition and yielding of time? And does the chair believe that perhaps just a reminder to members that we don't have to use all our time, might be better for us to self-police, so as to not have more procedural machinations? 
SMITH: Yeah. Well, if it's possible, there could be more, I suppose. I suppose that's always possible. But I guess, when--when that time has yielded, it would only be three minutes instead of five. That's--that's the thing. I don't think it's going to have a huge effect on whether or not that that time is yielded. 
And I do understand. I mean, these are important issues and they should be debated. And like--you know, this requires unanimous consent. So, rather than debate it, I'm saying we go to five minutes for the offer, five minutes for one opposed and then three minutes after that. Is there objection to that proposal? 
Hearing none, so ordered. That is what we are going to do. So, it is now in order to consider Log 547. For what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recommendation? Sorry, seek recognition. 
That would be you, Mr. Khanna. I'm sorry, is Mr. Khanna not with us? (INAUDIBLE) 
Alright, we'll hold off on that one for the moment. 
So, now it is in order to consider Log 428. For what purpose does gentleman from California, Mr. Garamendi seek recognition? 
GARAMENDI: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment and the gentleman is recognized to explain his amendment. 
GARAMENDI: Mr. Chairman, I intend to withdraw this amendment. But I do want to make a very brief statement here. We've had a long discussion about pit production, and whether we're actually going to be able to do it if we divert our attention from Los Alamos, as well as whether we need 80 pits at all. 
This amendment goes directly to that by stating clearly, or restating, that it is our goal to achieve a 30 pit--30 pits per year at Los Alamos, that that is our principal task. And we must do that. And it also, therefore, directs the NNSA to focus on that, rather than trying to do two things simultaneously. 
Which, they've been, basically, unable to do in the past. It also repeals the 80 pit per year until we have a chance to determine whether that's necessary. Having said that, I withdraw the amendment. 
SMITH: Thank you. The amendment is withdrawn. So, it's now an order to consider Log 132. For what purpose is the gentlewoman from Hawaii seek recognition? 
GABBARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? And without objection we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment and gentlewoman from Hawaii is recognized for purposes of explaining her amendment. 
GABBARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If any of you have ever gone to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, you'll see many different historic and important artifacts that speak to the history of air and space. And every one of those artifacts tells a story that represents significant achievement for humanity. 
If you go in on the left against the wall, there's a large dark green missile with Russian markings on it. That's the SS 20 intermediate range missile NATO, codename, Sabre. Its job was to attack NATO countries with one to three nuclear warheads, each more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.654 were built, three are now in museums, the rest are destroyed by a very important agreement. The intermediate range nuclear forces treaty, also known as the INF Treaty. 
There are a lot of different issues that have come up over the years. But the treaty persisted. Recently, rather than commit to negotiations that would address the issues with the treaty and further improve it, President Trump made the decision to walk away from it. This committee has asked for a report from the administration to tell us why he made this decision. What need was addressed by choosing to take this action and undoing this historic treaty? 
This request was made over a year ago. The report has still not been delivered to Congress. You would think this would be something that wouldn't be very hard for the administration to accomplish. This amendment, very simply, gives the administration some additional time to deliver the report and delays leaving the INF until it is delivered to Congress. 
I urge my colleagues on this committee to agree with me in saying, that if Congress asks the administration for information about decisions they're making about issues as critical to our national security as nuclear weapons, then the administration has a responsibility to respond. So, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I yield back. 
SMITH: I think that is very sound reasoning, and I concur and support the amendment. Who seeks recognition? I'm sorry. Ms. Cheney. 
CHENEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I oppose this amendment. And I urge my colleagues to do the same. The administration withdrew from the INF Treaty rightly, in my view. It had become a treaty that only the United States, of every country in the world, was abiding by. It was a treaty that was handcuffing us. 
We know that the Russians were violating the treaty. There was absolutely no question about it. It wasn't just us, but--but our NATO allies were in lockstep with us in determining that the treaty had been violated. And that maintaining our position of being part of the treaty was putting our security at risk. 
I would also note, Mr. Chairman, that when we are talking about the situation in which we find ourselves today, with respect to China, and with respect to the need to ensure that we are doing everything we can to defend ourselves and to create a deterrence against the Chinese government. And against the PLA and against their activities, particularly in the South China Sea and elsewhere. The men and women of INDOPACOM commander in particular, has talked about the extent to which the very missiles that would be prohibited were we to have stayed in this treaty are in exactly those type that we need to help increase deterrence against the government of China. 
That having the capability to field intermediate range missiles makes more difficult. The Chinese government's planning presents targeting dilemmas for them. And in fact, it's absolutely crucial. 
So, the administration, in my view, did exactly the right thing by withdrawing from this treaty. And we certainly don't want to put ourselves in a position where we are putting our own security at risk by insisting that we go back to the days when we were the only nation on Earth abiding by the restrictions in this treaty, while the Russians were cheating. So, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
And I yield back the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Thank you. Is there any further debate? Mr. Bergman. 
BERGMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And in the interest of brevity, I would associate my--myself with Ms. Cheney's comments. She--she hit the nail right on the head. 
From the standpoint of when you're looking at defending our, not only our homeland, but our allies around the world, we need to make sure that we don't limit our ability to, if you will, prosecute a fight, but more importantly, make sure it maybe doesn't happen to begin with. Because we're viewed by our adversaries, potential adversaries, as someone they would not want to come up against. 
So, when you start making decisions that take certain capabilities out of the military's playbook, you put yourself unnecessarily at risk. So, because of that, again, I oppose this amendment and I urge all my colleagues to--to support that opposition. 
I yield back 
SMITH: Mr. Lamborn. 
LAMBORN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I too, oppose this amendment. It was the Obama administration that first pointed out the violations of the INF Treaty by the Russians. And the Obama administration rightly tried to incentivize the Russians to come back into compliance through various gambits, diplomatic means and so on. But they were unsuccessful. 
The Trump administration simply continued that effort to try to get the Russians to come back into compliance, and they were unsuccessful. So, ultimately, the president, like Ms. Cheney said, made the right decision and withdrew from this because we were the only ones who were following the terms of this treaty. 
Now, we are today, in negotiations, trying to get the Russians and the Chinese to enter into new rounds of arms control agreements. It would really undercut our negotiating position if we unilaterally disarm, by giving away the ability to test missiles from 500 to 5,500 kilometers. You know, that that's a huge range. And to give that capability away unilaterally, before you enter discuss--discussions, it really weakens your position. 
So, if you believe in multilateral arms control agreements, and that we should try to get the Russians and Chinese to enter into those, at least to negotiate things and have talks, you don't want to support this amendment. 
So--and the last thing I would want to say, there's been some discussion as to, I don't know whether this is true or not, I'm merely raised it as a possibility, but are cooperative agreements with Israel to develop missile control might be affected by this agreement. If we were to give this unilateral restriction on our own abilities. So, I'd have to tease that out to see if that's true or not. But in any case it does undercut what we're trying to do now with a possibility of talks with Russia or China. And I yield back the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Mr. Turner. Mr. Turner, sorry. 
TURNER: Thank you. I--I just want to clarify as we do this debate that this is not just about a study as we were just debating studies previously. And an--an extension on a study. This is an extension on requiring that the United States comply with the INF treaty. 
Now as I've said in previous debates, I'd love to pass an amendment that requires Russia to comply with the INF treaty. But they're not. NATO--the--the NAC--the--the governing body for NATO all passed unanimously a resolution confirming that Russia was in violation of the INF treaty. 
So, what this would do would say Russia, you keep on going and violating the INF treaty. You field whatever you want because you're not limited to that at all. But we're going to make our country still comply. That's what this says. This doesn't say hey we're just going to give you some extra time to study. We're going to give you some extra time and we're going to make certain that the--the United States is bound by a treaty that--that Russ--that we're out of and that Russia violated and continues to violate. 
I--I--I would love an amendment that--that actually would bound our adversaries and--and not bind us. You know--the whole concept of non-proliferation is really looking at the way--nuclear weapons of the other guys. Treaties are about looking at the weapons of the other guys. If we unilaterally continue to adopt provisions that disarm ourselves we're just making ourselves less safe. I yield back. 
SMITH: Ms. Davis. 
DAVIS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. We have to remember that there are countries besides Russia that are watching what we do. Ms. Gabbard-- 
SMITH: --Yield your time to her-- 
DAVIS: --I'm happy to yield time to you. 
GABBARD: Thank you very much. To my colleague Mr. Lamborn, you--you raised a potential issue and question. This amendment has absolutely no impact on any existing or potential or future missile defense agreements. I think really the--the main issue here is our role is providing congressional oversight. A report was requested. This was passed over a year ago in January of last year. That report--it's not a study, it's not an examination it's simply a request for answers from the Administration on why they chose the action that they took and the justification for it. 
And here's one example of why this is important. We've heard from the Secretary of Defense that he wants to build these systems that previously would have violated the INF treaty agreement. And after building and developing the systems then we'll find the justification and placement for them, not the other way around. 
And I want to read his quote very briefly because it points to the--the need for us to get these answers first. He said, ""Clearly we're moving forward and developing intermediate range missiles. And once we have those that are prepared for deployment as I've said in the past, I would then consult with my commanders. Do they need these missiles in theater? If they do then we would begin a series of consultations with our allies and partners about where do we deploy those missiles."" End of quote. 
Seems like a kind of a cart before the horse situation here. I'll also point out that U.S. allies in NATO and Asia have they themselves not accepted any responsibility for citing these systems. NATO's stressing they'll consider other measures if the U.S. withdraws from the INF. 
Point being there are a lot of questions around tearing up and throwing away a historic treaty that unquestionably made the world a safer place. We need to do our job and provide that oversight before this decision is finalized. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you-- 
LAMBORN: --Would--would Ms. Davis yield? 
SMITH: Well, time's been yielded-- 
LAMBORN: It's her time. 
UNKNOWN: I guess it is. 
SMITH: Yeah you did not yield back. Ms. Gabbard yielded back. So, would you care to yield to Mr. Lamborn, Susan? 
DAVIS: Yes. 
LAMBORN: Yeah. Just a quick question. I don't like it when any administration doesn't comply with our request to do a--respond to something we've asked them to do. I would wor--like to work with you to have some kind of enforcement of that provision that we--that--that mandate of ours. But this is--this is like--you know--it--taking a sledgehammer to kill a--a fly. 
This is totally different than enforcing them to do an agreement-- 
GABBARD: --Briefly with 15 seconds left, this--this is not at all taking a sledgehammer approach. If they come and bring this report to Congress next week that would be great. 
LAMBORN: And you'll-you'll drop (INAUDIBLE)-- 
GABBARD: --There were no consequences--there would be no consequences to this. But they fail to do that-- 
LAMBORN: --You would drop this (INAUDIBLE)-- 
SMITH: --The gentlelady's time is expired. Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: I--I largely want to make the same point. I think we ought to be more careful about the studies and reports we require, but when we put them in there we ought to ensure that they do it. And--and frankly there are a number of provisions that are either in the mark or have been added to the mark that fence money to ensure that DOD complies with the law. I am very sympathetic with the gentlelady's point on that. 
If--if we tell them to do it they ought to do it. Now at the same time, to say but in the meantime we've got a--comply with the INF treaty when the only country that the INF treaty limited was us does not seem to me to make sense. So, I disagree with that part of the gentlelady's amendment. 
But like Mr. Lamborn said, when we put into law they need to do it. And we need--we need to be careful about what we put in. We're a little too liberal about that. But--but when we put it in we ought to hold our feet to the fire. I completely agree with that part. 
SMITH: Thank you. A question occurs on the gentlelady's amendment. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
(LAUGHTER) 
SMITH: I love that. Those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair the noes have it. Going to do it fairly. The noes have it. The--the amendment is defeated. Now I believe we have miss--Mr. Khanna back so we will go to-- 
TURNER: --Mr. Chairman, I--I have a point of order. Turner here. Our--our--the requirements that we were given when we got these new rules of--of people who were able to participate remotely and not travel here like the rest of us have was that they have to be on camera the entire time. And with Mr. Ro Khanna I've gotten to watch his electrical outlet, underneath his couch. The only time he's actually been with us is when he's speaking. 
And if you're--you're turning to him-- 
UNKNOWN: --Yeah-- 
TURNER: --If--if he's got an amendment I want to know is--like--is that--is that amendment going to be in order from someone who only shows up on their camera for their amendment? 
SMITH: Yes, it is-- 
TURNER: --I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Khanna. We're going to go to--sorry. I got to get the Log correct here. We will now consider Log number 547. For what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? 
KHANNA: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment and Mr. Khanna is recognized to explain the purpose of his amendment. 
KHANNA: Thank you Mr. Chairman, and I have been listening to the whole debate even if my face isn't on. I even thought I'd put on a tie for Representative Turner. So hopefully he'll be sympathetic to our amendment. 
This amendment is very straightforward. The United States does not need to be modernizing the ICBMs. The reality is if you talk to Secretary Perry, if you talk to Senator Sam Nunn, if you talk to Secretary (INAUDIBLE) the reality is that we have complete strategic deterrence capability within our submarines and with our aerial strategic bombers. 
We have every capacity to have complete deterrence. With the ICBMs you have the risk of accidental nuclear war. And it's pretty obvious why. If there is an accidental launch of an ICBM you can't take it back. On the other hand, you can call a submarine back. You can call an aerial bomber back. And the experts in this field say that the biggest risk for accidental nuclear war is the decision time. How--if we can elongate the decision time that allows a mistake to be averted. We help prevent accidental nuclear war. 
Now you don't have to believe that the (INAUDIBLE) difference(AUDIO GAP) amendment. Though I think if (AUDIO GAP) that is the case. You also can simply support extending the life of the current ICBMs bef--and studying further the issue before we give a sole source contract to Northup Grumman. This bill currently would give $1.5 billion--that's additional to the $500 million. So, we're giving an additional $1 billion for a sole source contract to modernize something that the experts are telling us increases our risk of nuclear war. 
And what we're saying is we shouldn't have that increase. And instead we should be putting that money to our national security need for extending the research into Coronavirus and tackling Coronavirus. We shouldn't be putting that money in a sole source contract to Northrop Grumman while we can continue what we did last cycle--last mark and--on the extension of the current--current systems and current missiles. 
That in a nutshell is the proposal. And I hope that it can be supported in a bipartisan way. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Turner. 
TURNER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. This amendment as Mr. Ro Khanna has accurately characterized is unilateral disarmament. It is saying that we're not going to have our land based ICBMs and this is something that--that obviously this committee opposes. But what's also very concerning is--is that the argument is that if you abandon our IB cy--ICBMs that we're somehow safer. 
Again, I'd love an amendment where I could ban Russia's ICBMs or China's. The reality is is that it--their ICBMs are still going to be pointed at us. If you don't have them pointed at our ICBMs they're going to be pointed at our cities. Because they're still coming this way. 
There have been study after study that has said that we need the triad. In--in fact there's--there's been studies that have indicated that our--our air launch bombers are--are significantly at risk from adversary submarines offshore if we don't have our ICBMs and our--our--our--our bombers are at risk. We significantly impact our ability to respond. And the key to response is not that we get to use nuclear weapons, but that we deter our adversaries. 
Our adversaries--I'll tell you what--you know--Vladimir Putin would love this--this amendment because it makes it the whole calculus of the U.S. and our viable deterrent easier for him. And the other aspect of this is that--you know--so he admits--thank you Mr. Ro Khanna for admitting that this impacts our modernization. As General Hyten has said, we have to modernize or we're not going to be able to continue our triad. 
This amendment though also does something incredibly interesting and I think even if you're for unilateral disarmament as Mr. Ro Khanna's suggesting, you probably should be against this amendment. Because what he's done is he's gone in and cut a--a billion dollars out of DOD. But there's still the money that's in NSA because we actually do our warheads in NSA and our missiles in DOD. 
So, all he's cutting is our modernization of our missile. The warhead would continue to--to go forward. And the portion that he cuts of--of our missile is actually aspects that are pretty important, like radiation hardening, microelectronics, materials studies, fuel studies, low toxic propellant formula--formulations. All of--guidance technology studies. Multi G-force environment. All of these things that are incredibly important. 
If you do this you are saying as he said in the beginning of his presentation we'd be eliminating the triad. And this is dangerous. We should not be doing this. And you should oppose this amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Ms. Cheney. 
CHENEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also oppose this amendment. You know--as Mr. Turner has said, the--we--we can go over all of the issues that we--we debate about the triad. Certainly I--I disagree with Mr. Khanna's characterization of the experts'--so-called experts' view on the triad. But--but I would also point out what Mr. Khanna has suggested we do is take a billion dollars out of funding for the GBSD and allocate that money to pandemic preparedness. 
Now this is--is--you know--I suppose something that--that he's done to try to say that there's a cause that's greater than--than our nuclear deterrent. I think it's important first of all to point out we have allocated significant resources to pandemic response, to pandemic relief, to ensuring that we are providing the kind of support this country needs to begin to recover from the pandemic and also to ensure that we're protecting ourselves from these kinds of things in the future. 
But--but there's one fundamental issue that is missing in this discussion. And that is China. And that--the extent to which the--the Chinese government--the Chinese Communist Party is directly responsible for the deaths that we have seen in the United States and around the world, directly responsible for the economic devastation. They caused this pandemic to be spread globally. And when I say they caused it to be spread globally I say that because they knew that they had human to human transmission, and they stopped travel from Wuhan to the rest of the world. But they did not allow travel from Wuhan into the rest of China. Or, they--they--sorry. They allowed travel from Wuhan into the rest of the world. 
They knew what they were doing. And instead of coming together to hold China accountable, which is what we ought to be doing--which is what we the Republicans asked Speaker Pelosi and others to do to join with us on our task force to hold the Chinese government accountable for this death and devastation. Instead, my colleague Mr. Khanna is proposing an amendment cutting a billion dollars out of our nuclear forces. These amend--this amendment helps China. This amendment helps America's adversaries. 
The people that would benefit from this amendment are the people that want to see the United States unilaterally disarmed. And that is the government of China. So, it is--it is absolutely shameful in my view. This is a time that we need to be clearer than ever before that we are going to put the resources behind modernizing our nuclear forces. 
Our adversaries are doing it, the government of China is doing it. We are falling behind. And the notion--I can't--I don't think that the Chinese government frankly could imagine in their wildest dreams that they would have been able to get the United States Congress--a member of the United States Congress to propose in response to the pandemic that we ought to cut a billion dollars out of our nuclear forces. It is more than they could have imagined. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. And I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Bacon. 
BACON: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I also stand in opposition to this amendment. I think this will seriously undermine our nuclear deterrence, one of the most important missions if not the most important mission that we have in--in our DOD. And it's our responsibility to make sure we have that right. 
I think we need a triad. So, if we--if we do what Mr. Khanna's req--suggesting it's going to call for the end of our--our ICBMs. It's going to call for the--it's going to--they're not going to be able to be service life extended. So, we'll go to a dyad. What does the ICBMs provide for us? They provide dependability. Typically, our 400 ICBMs run at about 95 percent readiness rate. You don't get that with submarines. You don't get that with bombers. 
It also provides a targeting problem that the Russians or Chinese can't overcome. Without the ICBM force you're talking somewhere between a dozen and two dozen targets to cripple our nuclear backbone. With the ICBMs you're talking 400 plus. So, taking the triad away to a dyad and getting rid of our ICBMs seriously undermines our nuclear deterrence. And puts us at much increased risk. 
And we've had several studies that have looked at the service life extension. It's not going to happen anymore for a 47 year old weapon system. General Hyten says we need to do this now. I agree. He says we can't do this service life extension and save money. It saves us no money. And Mr. Turner has it right. The warhead and the booster acquisition is currently synchronized. You slip one, you throw the whole acquisition program under the bus. 
Finally, I'd like to say this. The last two presidents, the last six Congresses, and the last six secretaries of defense have supported this ICBM program and we need to--and we need to get it done. Mr. Chair--Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Couple points in support of Mr. Khanna's amendment. I mean--we always have these debates and they always frustrate me because they veer off of reality. And the opposition sets up a strawman. That basically either you are against this amendment or you are in favor of unilateral disarmament. 
And the pointlessness of that is--is very frustrating. Because I suppose there maybe are some people who are in favor of unilateral disarmament. I confess even out where I come from I haven't--I haven't met them. The people who want to get rid of absolutely everything in our military and just hope for the best. Believe it or not, it hasn't gone that far. 
Now okay, maybe you're saying he's only suggesting unilateral disarmament of all nuclear weapons. That's equally absurd in the context of this amendment. I will confess there are some people who support that. I don't. I don't know if Mr. Khanna supports that or not. But I do know that his amendment does not. 
So--so let's--let's be 100 percent clear. Despite what you're going to hear over and over and over and over and over and over again from the other side, this amendment does not propose unilaterally disarming us of all nuclear weapons. That is not what it does. Mr. Lamborn I got you. I'm not--I'm aware that you're seeking recognition and you're on the list. We'll--we'll get to you in a minute. 
That's not what it does. What it does--it--it doesn't even for that matter get rid of--of the--the triad. Mr. Khanna did say that he supports that. I think there is more wisdom behind that proposal than people realize. But that's not what this does. It cuts a billion dollars out of--out of one program, the updated G--GBSD which is a unilateral contract. Because we got down to only one--one bidder on it. What this does is it--it--it ought--it proposes the idea that maybe we don't need as many nuclear weapons as we're talking about. 
And that--that's actually--I think that's actually a fairly interesting debate. I can understand why the other side doesn't want to have that debate. They just want to say either you're in favor or zero or you're in favor of every single one that we like. But that's not actually the debate that we're having. The debate that we're having is do we need as many nuclear weapons as we're talking about. 
And whatever China may or may not love, they currently have less than 300 nuclear warheads. And so, the issue is do we have an adequate deterrent. And it's worth sort of diving into that word instead of just throwing it out there. An adequate deterrent basically means the purpose of our nuclear weapons is to deper--deter nuclear adversaries. That's the purpose of it. And it's a very important purpose and it's one that I strongly support. Not all of my constituents do but I do. 
We--we need nuclear weapons to deter other countries like China and Russia from using their nuclear weapons. It is merely my viewpoint that having several thousand nuclear weapons presents that deterrent. And that the Chinese that we love to picture as being ten feet tall here--as I said, they--they feel they have an adequate deterrent with right now less than 300 nuclear weapons. 
Now it's quite possible in the next 20 years they double that. Okay? Let's say that then they have 600 nuclear weapons. They still won't have anywhere near as many would we--as we have simply with the other two legs of the triad. So--so that's a debate worth having. And I understand there are arguments. I haven't heard them yet today. I've heard them elsewhere. As to why we need that many nuclear weapons in order to deter them. 
I've heard those arguments. I do not agree with them. I think that China or Russia sitting there staring at let's just say 3,000 nuclear weapons and the possibility that any number of those could be rained down upon them will in fact be deterred. I know I would be. I mean--I don't know about your constituents but if I told my constituents that I felt comfortable launching a nuclear attack at China because they could only hit us with 300 nuclear weapons, I--I don't think they would just vote me out of office. I think they would put me in an insane asylum, okay? We do not want to face even 300 nuclear weapons. 
So, the debate we're having is what is an adequate deterrent. And connected to that debate from my perspective I will confess, not from the perspective of everybody--I want to have an adequate national security. Yes, we need to deter nuclear weapons. But there's a lot of other things that everyone in this committee knows that--that we need to do as well. 
And there is a finite amount of money. When you look at what is proposed by various DOD advocates, it's a long list. We want 355 ships in the Navy. I think we're sitting at about 308 at the moment. So, we've got a long way to go on that one. The Air Force came out with a study just last year saying that they wanted 25 percent more air platforms for their purposes. That's a lot of money too. 
So how are we going to meet all of those other needs if we spend another couple trillion dollars to make sure that we have instead of 2500 nuclear weapons 5,000 to be a nuclear deterrent. That's the debate that we're trying to have here. And I--I grant you again, there were some tough questions in there. But the whole--you know--they want to unilaterally disarm, and they don't care, and they just don't think we should have any nuclear weapons-- 
TURNER: --Mr. Chairman, will--will you yield for a moment-- 
SMITH: --Is not accurate. I apologize-- 
TURNER: --Mr. Chair, could--could you yield for a moment-- 
SMITH: --I was just about done-- 
TURNER: --Because you're characterizing--But you just--just-- 
SMITH: --But yes, I'll be happy to yield-- 
TURNER: --You're characterizing something I've said. So first off--so unilateral disarmament doesn't mean zero. And you are correct. Mr. Ro Khanna said that he is against the land portion of the--of the triad. Unilateral means you don't get anything for it. Bilateral means that your adversary does something too. And what I'm for is bilateral, which is-- 
SMITH: --That's good-- 
TURNER: --If you believe that we need fewer nuclear weapons, I believe that we should in (INAUDIBLE)-- 
SMITH: --(INAUDIBLE) reclaiming my time (INAUDIBLE). And that--that (INAUDIBLE) good--good debate to have. And I don't--I don't agree with that assessment either. Because what we want on our side is enough weapons of any kind to meet our national security needs. Okay? And if we have enough nuclear weapons--and again, that's debatable. We--we can have that argument. To deter our nuclear adversaries then us saying okay, instead of buying a bunch of nuclear weapons we're going to buy more airplanes. We're going to buy more ships. We're going to invest more in AI and satellites. 
I don't view that as unilateral. It's not a--we have met our national security needs on--on nuclear weapons. So, we're going to spend our money elsewhere. You know--do--do we get something for moving it around within our budget, no. I think what we get is a stronger national security. So that is the argument in favor of this amendment. And the argument of not buying into the--to the nuclear triad that is out there. 
I've got a bunch of people. 
KHANNA: Mr. Chairman-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Bishop. 
BISHOP: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I will stay within three minutes on this one. Mr. Chairman, your discussion would be interesting but that's all--and we came close to it with the Garamendi proposal. But that is not necessarily what this issue is about on this one. This is not discussing how many or what we will have. This is talking about the process. And as it's been pointed out by a couple of members this process is disjointed. 
So, the engineering and manufacturing development awards will be given this August unless there is something that changes that. And if the change takes place it will take change on the missile side, but it will not shake planes--take place on the design side of the warhead. So, what we are trying to do is make sure that we go with the armament portion as well as the missile portion and bring them together to finalize those so that it can become practical and useful. 
If we pursued with the one part which would not be impacted by this amendment and then restrict the other part, all we're doing is basically screwing up the entire system to--to make sure that we are out of sync. And that is to me the significant part of this. And--and I would like to just push back. It's not a sole contract. It was five years of competition and they finally came up with this contract. And there are a whole bunch of large, medium, and small companies that are suppliers of it at the same time. It is not a sole contract. 
So, with that--and I--I did it within--I--I'll give you a minute and a half back so you can get home earlier. 
(LAUGHTER) 
SMITH: You're a good man. Mr. Bergman. 
BERGMAN: Thank you Mr. Chairman and I'll be brief as well. Because all of you articulated your positions very eloquently. I'm--if I've got to try to defeat two axes of a triad I can plan my attack better regardless of the number of weapons I'm coming up against. If I've got to come up against three different axes now I've got a different challenge as a commander. 
So, I would suggest to you that what is the goal. Number one to fight and win. But the best goal is to not to have to fight at all. President Reagan said strength--peace through strength. And the best way to have that--that strength show is that we are unpredictably unpredictable, but we know that we have the capability because we as a country invested necessarily so and we all have to sacrifice when it comes to trade-offs. But this is deterrence at its finest. That is necessary for--for our security and the security of other countries around the world. 
And with that I'll yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Lamborn. 
LAMBORN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too oppose the Khanna amendment. And I won't repeat the same arguments that have already been made. I'll put forth a couple new points though. One is the billion dollar amount seems to me it's not linked to anything tangible. It's just pull--it's kind of pulled out of thin air and not really thought through. 
But secondly, the triad--and we're not setting--Mr. Chairman we're not trying to set up a strawman. No one's saying we're going to zero. But it is clear that this amendment is intended to cripple one of the three legs of the triad. That's--that's been acknowledged and admitted. It would cripple that leg of the triad. 
And as Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bergman have said, if you go to two legs it's easier to target from those who would oppose us. And further than that it makes it more--makes us more vulnerable if there are technological breakthroughs on the other side to detect submarines that are at sea or to fight and air based offensive capability that we have now. 
We're more vulnerable if there's some kind of technological breakthrough if we're depending on two legs rather than three legs. Or if there's a mechanical or some kind of technological problem on our part where those can't be deployed because of a--a new development where that's negative to us that we have to fix. During--that makes us more vulnerable also. 
So, going to two legs, a dyad, is just really a--to give that up unilaterally without bilateral concessions would be a big problem. So, for those reasons I would ask for a no vote on this amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Waltz. 
WALTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield my time to Ms. Cheney. 
CHENEY: Thank you very much. You know--I just want to point out Mr. Chairman, we too welcome debate. But--but it's not--it's not real debate if people aren't following the rules--you know. With all due respect to my colleague Mr. Khanna, not only has he not been on his camera but he missed the time when his amendment was up and he was allowed to simply--you know--offer it apparently at his own convenience. So as--as a point of order I do think it's important to say we want to make sure that the rules are being followed. 
Secondly, I appreciate very much the chairman saying that he welcomes open debate on this right after he's cut everybody's time to three minutes and then taken the chairman's prerogative to extend his own time indefinitely. 
Finally, on substance. The chairman and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they support arms control. Say they don't want to see unilateral disarmament. But right now, at this moment our special negotiator--our special envoy for arms control is negotiating with the Russians. And so, for us to be sitting here saying we're going to unilaterally cut a billion dollars makes his position incredibly weaker. Undercuts him directly. 
So--you know--you--I think it's really important for people who are watching this, important for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to do more than just sort of say the rhetoric about well we really want arms control, we really want bilateral cuts, we don't want unilateral cuts. But everything that you're doing cuts off debate of the other side, violates the rules, violates the rights of the minority, and imposes restrictions and proposes policies that undercut the actual arms control discussions that are underway. 
What in the world--you know--do the--do the Russians have to gain by agreeing to any negotiations if they think well we don't even have to agree, and the Americans are going to go ahead and cut on their own. So, I would just urge again my colleagues to oppose this amendment and state once again for the record a fundamental concern about this process, about the way that this--this hearing is being run and about the extent to which the rules are being violated. And they're your own rules. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. We--we are not violating the rules of the minority. It is longstanding practice that the chairman and ranking member are not subject to the same time lims--limits as everybody else. We--we are--we are following the rules. And just felt a little ganged up on here over on the other side. Which is fine. Mr. Thornberry. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I th--it is a source of pride for me and hopefully all members that we always conduct this markup in open session. As opposed to the other body that always conducts theirs in closed session. The only time I start to question that is when we get into this area. 
Because I do think we could get a little deeper into not only numbers, but capabilities of other countries and it would be helpful for the discussion. I--let me just say this. Adequate nuclear deterrence has to be credible to do its job. And as Mr. Bishop was saying, credibility comes not--from the weapons and from the delivery systems. 
Now we have messed around in this country so that all three of our delivery systems are aging out about the same time and have to be replaced. 
Now, we are in the process of building new bombers and new submarines and we have to replace the missiles as well to keep that credible deterrent. Now at no point does that ever take more than seven percent--seven percent of the defense budget. And in my view it's the most important thing we can do to have a credible deterrent that prevents nuclear--nuclear war. 
And I--I think it is absolutely accurate as--as people have said to unilaterally give something up--one leg of the triad in a--in essence because these missiles are aging out would be a dramatic shift in the strategic balance--in the strategic posture we have had since the end of the second World War. So, I think this amendment is a mistake. But I also think we've got to keep in mind credibility is what makes a deterrent effective and thus adequate. 
SMITH: Thank you. The question now occurs on the amendment offered by Mr. Khanna. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair the noes have it. I will request a roll call vote. So further proceedings on this amendment will be suspended. We'll add it to the end of the list. And it is now in order to consider Log 528. For what purpose does the gentleman from Alabama seek recognition? 
ROGERS: Mr. Chairman, I call up amendment Log 528 and ask for its consideration. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. And without objection we will dispense the reading of the amendment. And Mr. Rogers is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of explaining his amendment. 
ROGERS: Thank you Mr. Chairman. My amendment would have established an interagency task force to address China's use of non-traditional-intelligence collectors targeting our leading research institutions. Members of this committee and others have been briefed on China's persistent espionage threat to American competitiveness and security. Combatting these efforts should be a bipartisan priority. 
In the course of negotiating this amendment we accepted every single majority edit that was requested. But the Judiciary Committee still refused to waive jurisdiction despite weeks of discussion. I will continue to pursue this issue and hope that we can put America's interests ahead of congressional turf battles. 
I'd like to thank the staff who have worked on this issue for the past several months: Mandy Bowers, Emily Trapani, Megan Devlin(PH), Forrest McConnell, Special Agent Steve Wintase(PH), and Secret Service Special Agent Chris Goitz(PH). Ste--Steve and Chris were detailed to the Homeland Security Committee and their years of law enforcement experience were essential in this area. With that Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my amendment and yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. And we certainly will continue to work with you on that. It is now in order to consider Log 343. For what purpose does the gentleman from California seek--and by the way, I apologize for this. But Paul Mitchell Paul Cook--I rotate back and forth sometimes in my brain. So, if I hesitate before I call on you that's what I'm doing. 
(LAUGHTER) 
I--I--I don't know how that makes you feel. But--but--what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? 
COOK: Thank you Mr. Chair. 
SMITH: You have an amendment at the desk. 
COOK: I--I--I do but I'm going to withdraw it-- 
SMITH: --Okay-- 
COOK: --Which will make everybody very, very happy-- 
SMITH: --You're--you're recognized for that purpose. Go ahead-- 
COOK: --I know they've been waiting with bated breath for quite a while here. Briefly though for--I wanted to talk about an important issue. And it's one which--I'm leaving but it's one which is going to stay around with this committee. And the amendment that I had was about domestic rare earth neo-magnet capability. I know everybody here has been waiting all day for this. So, I will go right to the point here. 
Neo-magnets. They are necessary for most of our advanced weapon system including aircraft, submarines, missiles. And unfortunately, the United States continues to rely on foreign import of these magnets. One reason is that a foreign owned company holds the patent in the United States for a neo-magnet production. The patent's pretty flimsy but it's enough to threaten any U.S. producer of neo-magnets with law--wasteful and costly lawsuits. 
We need to help our domestic producers by eliminating fears about being dragged into this litigation. Until we do that we're going to have a real problem with something that is becoming more and more important, and that's the issue of neo-magnets. And there is one--I think Ms. Cheney might have one in her district. Very, very few. It's had financial difficulties and right now the company is running on--on fumes and unfortunately what it mines there is controlled by a Japanese company that sends the product to China. 
Now I--I wouldn't be worried about this that much, but this is something that--and I'm going to withdraw this amendment. But I hope that you will continue to support American manufacturing in the rare earth industry. The problem is lawsuits, everything like that--that this company has been on the ropes. Jerry Lewis kept it going for a while. It's right on the--the border of California and Nevada. In fact, all the workers there are actually from Nevada. 
But this is one of those ones that we have to have because this is something we need for F-35s, submarines, missiles, and it's very, very similar if you remember your history when there was a guy by the name of Harry Truman at the end of the war. And he became kind of the guru of looking out for American industry so that we could protect this. 
And he did an absolutely incredible job. Now I don't have the tact and diplomacy that Harry Truman had. But he certainly got the job done and he protected American industries that were making vital materials and we're in danger of losing another one. 
So, I will withdraw that. Obviously the future we need to get back into the magnet making business because it's so important for so many of these advanced weapons systems. I withdraw my amendment at this time. 
SMITH: The amendment is withdrawn. And now it is in order to consider amendment--well, sorry. It's a Log number 2. So, one of the first ones that got dropped. And--I'm sorry. (INAUDIBLE) turn our page here. For what purpose does the gentleman from New Jersey seek recognition? 
NORCROSS: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. Without objection we will dispense with the reading of the amendment. And I recognize Mr. Norcross for the purposes of explaining his amendment. 
NORCROSS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'd like to thank Mr. Cook for bringing up an issue that is paramount and absolutely connected to these--the amendment I have here. This amendment requires DOD to increase the percentage of American parts that makes a major acquisition program considered domestic to 75 percent by October 1st of 2021 and phases in five percent a year until we reach 100 percent by 2026. 
In addition, this amendment requires DOD to create a repository of information related to domestic content to better inform contracting decisions in the future. We have talked about this issue year after year. Last year I had an amendment and it got tangled up in a bid that was going to happen in the shipping industry. The ship industry, not shipping. And I withdrew it. And several members that were here talked about working together. And we held a number of meetings to go over this very issue. 
Trying to take into consideration many of the issues and it's extremely complex. But right now, under current law the interpretation for Buy American Act--the end product only needs to contain 50 percent domestic content. If we have not learned our lesson under this pandemic, when are we going to learn? We understand you can't throw the switch and turn it in--on overnight. It will take time, it will take predictability, and will take us making a decision to help the people we represent. 
The idea of offshoring more and more of our work, particularly in the defense industry, is insane. Time after time people in this room we talk about brining jobs home, making sure Made in America actually means something. Well this is our opportunity. Strong support from the defense industry work force that they're serious at this point. Bring back manufacturing. 
The idea that the issues that have come up is that we have a waiver system that is already in place. But to back up, what is a major defense acquisition? $300 million in designated--that would be part of the development, tests, and the evaluation. $1.8 billion. So, we're not talking the little programs buy a couple screw in the--here and there. It does not include highly sensitive classified programs. It does not include unfortunately the project carried out using the rapid funding and prototyping. 
We understand that's in a different category. But when we talk about we can't change--that's why this is phased in over a six year period. To give predictability to those industries, those contractors so they can start to bring back the work to here in America. 
Now we don't have that capacity. We need it back. Because that means jobs. Will it impact current contracts? Absolutely not. 2021 moving forward. So that takes out unfortunately the major programs--the F-35. But the one thing that is interesting, the Buy America waivers currently in place. Buy America and the--what we're changing here would not change if the domestic product was not available. 
Number two, unreasonable costs. Three, trade agreements. Four, public interest. They are currently part of the law. We are not touching those. They're staying in. We talked right here last year about doing the right thing and this is our opportunity. With that I'll reserve. 
SMITH: Thank you. Chair recognizes Mr. Turner. 
TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a perfecting amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Actually, just technically you--you have a second degree amendment-- 
TURNER: --I miss-- 
SMITH: --The--the lawyers are yelling at me about that-- 
TURNER: --You're right. You are-- 
SMITH: --It's a second degree. 
(LAUGHTER) 
TURNER: You are correct, and I appreciate your correction. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment. And without objection we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. And Mr. Turner is recognized for five minutes for the purpose of explaining his amendment. 
TURNER: I--I--I think everybody is with Chairman Norcross. I mean--we would love everything to be 100 percent and--and the things that where it says it can be below 50 percent or at 50 percent--many of the things we have are 100 percent. But the problem is--and I'm not one of the ones who offered to work with you and then did not. So, I--I--I--this is not one of the--a bait and switch issue at--at all. 
But I am concerned and it's not just the issue of Buy America or cost or limitation on access to things. I--I want to raise an issue that I'm very concerned about and that's Sell America. You know--I--I work with our allies in NATO. And you have under your portfolio right now the F-35-- 
SMITH: --Yep-- 
TURNER: --And the F-35 is a multinational sourced platform. Of course, we had the issue of Turkey of trying to take them out of the--of that sourcing. You put an exemption for trade agreements but actually trade agreements generally exclude military sales. And one of the biggest issues that we have that affect us is offset agreements. Where we make a major sale to another nation and the other nation requires that in turn a, something be purchased that goes into one of our--our facilities. You and I just had a conversation about a frame for one of our helicopters-- 
SMITH: --Yep-- 
TURNER: --That's made in a nation where that nation then buys things from us that offsets and that's part of the arrangement and agreement that encourages Sell America. So, you are correct that this is complex. Everybody--there's not one person on this committee who would not absolutely be for 100 percent of everything we do being--being America. But for as you describe that there are those consequences of which we need to--to manage. 
So, my perfecting amendment says this is--this is an--an important destination. But we need DOD to tell us all of the things that this will affect. Specifically, also one of those things being Sell America. How does this aff--because there's a huge impact on us both with interoperability to our allies and our ability to lower our overall costs. As you know, the F-35 costs are lowered because we are selling it to our allies. 
What--what is that--you know--three bank shot in pool consequences. And so that is the purpose of my amendment. Thank you Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Garamendi. 
GARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We had a long discussion a while ago on rape in the military academies. And the discussion centered around studies. And as I recall the result of that--or at least one of the arguments was a study is a great way not to do anything. And that's pretty much what we have here with this secondary amendment is a study that will certainly not do anything. 
We know already the answer to all of these questions that are in this amendment. And I would suggest that what this will do is to just delay what we ought to do today, which is to adopt the underlying amendment and bring back to American the manufacturing of key and important components in our military. 
Many of us just voted a few hours ago for a major infrastructure bill. I don't know if there are no votes amongst this group. But those who voted yes voted to substantially increase the amount of American content in the infrastructure of the United States. We don't need another study. We know. We know from past studies, we know from economic analysis, we know from all that has occurred that we need to bring back to American manufacturing. 
A couple of us in this committee, myself and another are trying to bring back to America the manufacturing of generic drugs. Or at least the active ingredients in those generic drugs. Many of us are also trying to bring back to America ship building. And that's a good thing. But this study--this secondary amendment here would simply put this whole thing off and I guess in some ways keep us from having to face the reality. 
The reality that we are losing our manufacturing capability in America and therefore a critical component of our national defense. I think we ought to take this particular study and trash it and get on with building things in America. 
SMITH: One quick programming note. Since this is a second degree amendment when we're done with it, it could conceivably require a roll call vote immediately. So, for those of you listening at home your presence will be required shortly. Mr. Byrne. 
BYRNE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I strongly agree that we need to do something about getting more of our defense production in the United States-- 
SMITH: --John--think--your mic's on. Sorry. 
BYRNE: Must not be a very strong microphone. I've never had a problem being heard. I strongly agree we should bring defense production back to the United States. When I first got on this committee we were talking about what we were going to do about sending up our stuff--sensitive stuff on Russian rockets, which is amazing. 
But I disagree with the gentleman from California. I don't think we know everything. For example, I don't think what we know how this would affect the incredible array of things that we have to have produced in order for us to have weapon systems. If--there are lots of moving parts--you should know--the gentleman knows from New Jersey--go in these things. 
I--I don't know how this would affect for example the program we've had going on with Israel on--on missile defense for example. So, I think we all want to get to the same place. But I do think it makes sense for us to sit down, have a study, have the Department of Defense come back to us and say this is how it would affect this program and this program and this program. And we may have to be more nuanced in the ultimate piece of legislation because of the different types of weapons programs and how it would affect them. 
So, I don't think this is a delay maneuver at all. I think it's an honest and very important effort for us to get the appropriate information so that we know when this piece of legislation comes down that we've got it tuned to the point where it actually will have the affect we want it to have and not have the Secretary of Defense have to come in and grant a bunch of waivers because we didn't think them through. 
And--and I'm always a little nervous about waivers to be honest with you. Sometimes it's used right. Sometimes it's not used right. So, I would rather us know what we're doing before we put out a piece of legislation. And I think Mr. Turner's amendment is an honest, good faith effort to do that and I support it and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Carbajal. 
CARBAJAL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to yield my time to Representative Norcross. 
NORCROSS: Couple of items. And Mr. Turner, great point about NATO. We care about all our allies. But interestingly enough between the public interest waiver, WTO, and others only three countries are not in it: Albania, Montenegro, and Northern Macedonia. Which we care much about, but we never did a study when we offshored the products that we're talking about. 
We never asked the American worker how is this going to impact you and your family as those jobs went away. We understand that's been over years and many different issues applied to it. But now based on the information that we heard here and that we studied over the last year, we wanted to set the stage to move it back. Industry--who I've talked to repeatedly--wants predictability. 
They want time. This includes both of those. But most importantly I call it the circuit breakers. We don't know what we don't know because things are going to change. Number one, current ju--contracts are not effective. So, the F-35 is not part of it. The issue with Israel is not a part of it. Moving forward it potentially could be. 
But you have enough circuit breakers here through the public interest piece, domestic non-availability, and quite frankly the ability of the Secretary of Defense to say you're not good--you either get a waiver or not there. That we do have control over this. We don't have to study it again. We will be experiencing that because we're taking a partial step for next year and then moving in. 
So, we have years. If there's a negative impact I'll be the first one to say let's go back and look at it. But the way that we set this up we have the circuit breakers if there's a problem and we're heading in the right direction over a period of six years. Thank you to-- 
SMITH: --Thank you. Mr. Conaway. 
NORCROSS: --Mr. Carbajal. Yield back-- 
CONAWAY: --Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I--I'm supportive of the gentleman's trying to do but I would point out some things that maybe this is more for the conference committee fight than tonight. And that is if history's any indication we won't get this done 'til December. And that only gives you nine months to meet your deadline of a 50 percent increase in U.S. sourced material from 50 percent to 75 percent. Don't know that we actually just can get that done. 
I also think that if American produ--producers were competitive worldwide they would--we would already be doing it. And so there will be increased costs associated with. This fits in well with the overall broader context of pandemic--conversations about supply chains. And as we look at pharmaceuticals, whatever we as Americans are going to have to understand we're going to have to pay more for things done here in America than currently being done elsewhere just because those things are coming in cheaper than we can do it here. 
So, you've got to acknowledge that as well. And I would also think you would want teeth in failure to comply. Simply allowing the Secretary Whoever to waive failure to comply doesn't get you where you want to get to. So perhaps in a conference you can look at the idea that you're--you're not going to be able to get there by October one of 21 with that 50 percent number. So, kind of move some of that around. Put some teeth in the failure. And--and be honest with the American people. 
This will cost more money. The chairman has talked about not having more money for defense. This will cost us more money. We need to be--you know--straightforward with that. So, with that I yield back. 
SMITH: Alright. I'm sorry. Mr. Wittman. 
WITTMAN: Yeah. And I--listen, I agree with the gentleman from New Jersey. I appreciate him continuing to push the issue. But just as others have mentioned, the element of increased cost potentially means fewer aircraft, fewer ships, and we're trying to get to that number. So, we all have to keep in mind the reality of potentially what it--what that brings to us. 
Another element too is that in many situations there is not an exact comparable component that's built by foreign manufacturers. And as you know, our aircraft have systems that are supplied to be in the aircraft by the government. The same for the ships. You know--the shipyard builds the ships but there are government supplied elements that go on board that ship. 
The key is if nobody in the United States manufactures that exact system then you either have to do one or two things. You either have to redesign the ship or the aircraft to fit another dissimilar system in or then you have to go ahead and--and provi--and--and look at an exemption which again, gets you away from where--where you need--need to be. 
So, I think that you need to have some provision or some discussion about existing systems and making sure that you're not going to be adding time and cost to those. Especially when you've got a hot production line. All the sudden you're saying well there--there's nothing here that's available for that. 
NORCROSS: Would the gentleman yield for a moment? 
WITTMAN: Sure. Yes. 
NORCROSS: We--we have the domestic non-availability. That is that exact circuit breaker. Let's talk about a billion dollar piece of equipment--an aircraft carrier that you know so much about. That means a half a billion today could be foreign. A half a billion. And all we're doing is talking about taking that down to 250 million. Think about these numbers. 
Those could be American jobs. And where we have a problem we have a circuit breaker for those unforeseen events. I am sure every one of us would like to go home and say I just helped you get a job today. I brought it back to America. And I know everybody in this room cares about it. A study is a great idea if we want to extend it, and we can continue. But let's set the stage here. Because it's still not going to take care of the big issue here of bringing all that job home. 
This is still Swiss cheese with the waivers, folks. This is not going to change overnight. We can pass this and still study it to find out effects. Again, we certainly didn't find out when they moved the jobs offshore how it would affect us. But thank you for yielding. 
WITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Seeing no further debate, the question occurs on the amendment--on the substitute amendment. Sorry, not substitute. Second degree amendment. You're not perfect, you're second degree. That's what I'm saying. 
So, it's a second degree amendment by Mr. Turner. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair the noes have it. The noes have it. The amendment is defeated. It is now in order to consider Mr. Norcross' amendment. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it, the amendment is agreed to. It is now in order to consider Log 239. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from California seek recognition? 
SPEIER: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: The clerk will pass out the am--the amendment. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment and Ms. Speier is recognized for five minutes for the purposes of explaining her amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment strengthens post-service ethic standards for former high-ranking military and DOD officials. In the FY18 NDAA Congress made important progress in establishing higher ethical standards for the U.S. military. We had passed legislation championed by the late Senator John McCain to ensure that all generals and admirals and their civilian equivalents had to meet at least a one-year cooling off period before lobbying any official in The Department of Defense with a two-year restriction for three-star and four-stars. Before we passed this law, there was a restriction but it was a feel good, do nothing, toothless provision. And Air Force general could retire one day and lobby the office of the Secretary of Defense or the Navy about the F-35 the next. 
Closing this loophole was an example of bipartisan progress towards a more ethical government and a slower revolving door. This progress is at risk. DOD's NDA proposal this year would have rolled back almost the entirety of the 2018 reforms. Apparently senior DOD officials were more concerned about finding their next job than protecting taxpayers. 
I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for not including the DOD's truly appalling proposal in this year's NDAA rather than weakening ethics standards I believe we should strengthen them. Serving as a general and admiral or a high-ranking DOD civilian should be an honor and a public trust, not a ticket to a revolving door lucrative lobbying job with major defense contractors and other companies with businesses, with business, before the department. Public service should be, just that; not for the purpose of private gain. 
This amendment would lengthen the restriction from two years to four years for three-star and four-star generals and admirals and extend the one-year restriction to two years for colonel's and captains and their civilian equivalents. It would also expand the restriction to cover business development activities because selling products and services to the military the day after taking off the uniform is just as unseemly and we should expect more from our leaders. 
With that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Who seeks recognition? Mr. Mitchell? 
MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. While I wholly su--I'm unaware what the department submitted in terms of the language that they had asked for. So I'm not going to get into what they asked for versus what we think. We had policies we put forth; they're pretty clear, they were fairly strong; prevent the immediate involvement of senior officers, three-star and four-star generals and immediately lobbying Congress or their previous em--place of employment. This expands that dramatically to two year pro--to four years for those officers while also adding two-star generals for two years and colonels. Chairwoman Speier referenced captains. I don't think they're in this provision but--I certainly hope not. 
I make the point I think that we hear often about the gap between the defense industry and the needs of the military; about them understanding what we're trying to get from business and what we're trying to get here in Congress to get those businesses to do, yet now we want them to not talk to us for a longer period of time. We want--even down to colonels we don't want to talk to you here about that for as much as two years. So we're going to lengthen the gap between that knowledge of the military, of The Defense Department and our industry in Congress and the department. 
I'm not sure that helps us achieve the innovation development we want. That's what the amendment does by prohibiting officers from lobbying and business development; whatever that may mean, lobbying is fairly clearly defined. We now have made that gap even greater on some idea that we're going to improve ethics. Ethics aren't a matter of regulation. They're not a matter of legislation. I--I have to be honest with you, and--and I think we've talked about this before, chairwoman, ethics come in--from internally in the person because we all know that we could put this out there and based on, you know, interesting manipulation you can call yourself anything you want and get away with it. Ethics come from people, not from regulation, not from a prohibition. 
So we can't operate based on assuming that every officer that goes to The Department of Defense somehow will act unethically and we need to keep them away as long as possible. What, we're going to go from four years then two years, and we're going to say six years? At some point I want to go back with a--I would like to go back to the provisions that we had last year that we thought were appropriate to do in terms of preventing lobbying, defined as lobbying, and just continue those for the--for this NDAA but I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment because I really don't think it helps develop the working relationship we need with the defense industry, department of pent--the Pentagon and Congress and at some point in time, we have to depend--we have ethical people or we really should just give up. 
With that, I will yield time to Mr. Bacon who's frantically waving over here and he'll hit me if I don't. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
(LAUGHTER) 
BACON: I wasn't trying to wave at you and cut your time short but, thank you for yielding. 
(LAUGHTER) 
And, Mr. Chair, I think we should only vote for this if we match the same rules to Congress coming out. 
SMITH: I would support that. 
BACON: We should not have double standards a--comparing a four-star general versus a congressman. Thank you. I yield. 
SMITH: Good idea. 
MITCHELL: Yeah I--I reclaim my time, Mr. Chair. And if we're going to do that, Madam Chairman, then let's be honest about it. We need top--the same prohibition on chiefs of staff, the same prohibition on senior staff of committees and if you want to extend those four years, ask them how that's going to work for our government. This can get to the level of silly-- 
SMITH: The gent--gentleman's time has--has expired. 
MITCHELL: Ah, thank you. I'll--I'll just give up the ghost. Thank you, sir. 
SMITH: Yeah, I mean, I--I was kind of with you until the last--last comment. There's--there's nothing silly about this. I think this is--this--this--this is important but I think the point about how far do you go? And I think the gentlelady, Ms. Speier is correct, it was a good important step we took a few years ago that we put these protections in place, you want to have some of that separation but you also have a need to have talent that has experience and if--I mean, I--I saw some pretty serious proposals last year that I think would have made it very difficult for us to hire anybody in the House that would have, you know, extended it to, I feel, like five years. 
Basically saying, if you come to work in government and you develop expertise, your next job, you're not ever going to be able to use that and I do want to strike a balance between making sure we have strong ethical standards in place for everybody in government and a balance saying that if you go to work for government, you will then never work again in your chosen field. It's a difficult balance to strike. I think we certainly have more to do than--than we've done right now but if we extend it to four years for--for--for DOD, how does that fit into everything else? And I'm not--I'm not opposing the amendment; that's something we're going to talk about in conference and try to work our way through but it is the kind of thing that requires a more comprehensive approach, I believe, than just targeting one particular area at a time. 
I saw some hands. Mr. Thornberry? 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, I--I just want to emphasize the key point to me. Military officers already have the strictest standards in government and this amendment would double it. And it's one thing if you are going to apply that extraordinarily strict standard across all the agencies and include us but to treat the military with so much more suspicion and--and--and, you know, a variety of other--other things that would go--I think it would be a terrible mistake when they already have the strictest standards in government. 
So this, to me, goes too far and it w--it--it--it tips the balance that you're just describing between ethics and-- 
UNKNOWN: No, I'm going to-- 
THORNBERRY: --attracting good talent, way too far--in--in the wrong direction. Somebody-- 
SMITH: I--I apologize-- 
THORNBERRY: Mute your microphone. 
SMITH: Someone--someone is unmuted on the remote hearing so let's make sure everyone's muted. Mr. Conaway? 
CONAWAY: A couple of quick points. First off, non-compete contracts have some length to begin to be unenforceable and--and four years is approaching that in the private sector. Second thing, this is--these men and women have had the highest responsibilities probably in government throughout their career up into that--especially those three and four stars, they were making life and death decisions every single day and so somehow they come out of that role and immediately become charlatans who are out for something terrible. 
It also insults the men and women who currently in the decision-making process that somehow some friendship or whatever could--could affect their decision making. Again, tonight, we've made no--no predicate for where the wreck has happened. Where has it been where folks who had served at the revolving door for two years and then they go back--they go into the sector and they've taken advantage of it, they've mishandled whatever's going on, they've had some sort of undue influence on the decision makers currently in the position of Department of Defense, these agencies, we're just--we're just adding two years to it with no basis for why we need two versus--why we need four versus two. So, again, this is a--another ready, fire, aim and I oppose the amendment. I--I yield back. 
SMITH: Does anybody else seek recognition? Not. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: All those opposed will say, no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair, the noes have it. The noes have it, the amendment is defeated. It is--we're moving onto the next one. I a--well, I'm going to introduce this one and then turn over responsibility for the next few minutes so I can go get something to eat quickly. So, Susan, I'll be passing this to you in just a moment. But it is now in order to consider Log 265. For what purpose does the Gentlelady from California seek recognition? 
SPEIER: I have an amendment at the desk and I'm glad to say, this is my last amendment. 
(LAUGHTER) 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without ob--I still say that and I expect I have to pause and wait for something to happen but, nothing happens. Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and Ms. Speier is recognized for the purposes of discussing her amendment. 
SPEIER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is quite simple, colleagues. Under current law DOD must make legally required reports available to the public by posting them on a public Website. However, DOD takes advantage of loopholes to avoid posting the reports. This amendment is just straightforward, it would require to the maximum extent possible, DOD to post these reports not later than one week after transmitting them to Congress. It does nothing to undermine the ability of DOD to withhold reports that contain classified, proprietary, or other information that could harm national security. But it would require DOD to post on a public web--website a citation to the provision of law requiring the report, the date on which the report was submitted to Congress and the exception that the DOD relied on for not making the contents of the report public. 
This language is widely supported acr--across the political spectrum including organizations such as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity signed a letter supporting a version that would apply government-wide. Well, this amendment only applies to DOD, a government-wide version pass the House on a bipartisan basis by voice vote and I'm glad to say, Ms. Stefanik was the co-sponsor and was introduced in the Senate by Senator Rob Portman. 
These are modest and reasonable improvements that would reinforce, to the DOD, the importance of transparency and accountability. I reserve the balance of my time. 
DAVIS: Is there any debate on the amendment? Good, let's just pass it. Mr--Mr. Thornberry? 
THORNBERRY: I just have to point out, it--our--our back of the envelope guess is that we get a thousand reports a year and it may be many more than that. So here's what's going to happen. Under this amendment they've got to be public within a week. Guess what, they're not going to send them to us until they're ready to go public within a week and it's going to take longer for us to get any--all the thousand reports that we get. 
I think this may be one of those things where the consequence is something that we wo--would regret. 
DAVIS: Any other comments? Mr. Mitchell? 
MITCHELL: I would agree with, Mr. Thornberry, that the intent of the amendment makes sense in terms of the transparency that we're seeking. Clarity that classified proprietary information is excluded is extremely important and I don't see it at its face in the amendment. More importantly, the timing is a concern. It's a concern that Mr. Thornberry laid out. If the chairwoman would withdraw it and work on it for the floor, I could support something that said it had to be put out to the general public within 30 days; some timeframe that it is not delayed. 
UNKNOWN: I'm happy to do that, Mr. Mitchell. 
MITCHELL: If we could do that-- 
UNKNOWN: I'll withdraw. 
MITCHELL: If we could do that, I--I think we covered that answer. I'd like to see clarity on proprietary information, on classified information so that, in fact, we exclusively say--specifically say, that is excluded. 
DAVIS: For purposes of debate, does the gentlemen yield? 
MITCHELL: I certainly will, thank you. 
DAVIS: The gentleman yields. 
MITCHELL: I'll yield to the chair-- 
DAVIS: Ms. Speier? 
SPEIER: I'm--I'm happy to accept that recommendation, I'll withdraw the amendment and will work on it for the floor. 
MITCHELL: Thank you, very much. I'll yield back. 
DAVIS: Thank you very much. Okay, the next amendment is Mr. Crow. 
UNKNOWN: Here you go. 
DAVIS: Oh, sorry. 
CROW: Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. 
DAVIS: She was filling in. Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Everybody can find the amendment. The computers--Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the chair recognizes, Mr. Crow, for the purposes of explaining his amendment. 
[*]CROW: Thank you, Madam Chair. The core of this amendment, the thrust this amendment is the idea that America is strong and we are safe because we have friends. You know, we draw tremendous strength from our alliances and from our partnerships and the people around the world who have continuously joined with us and that fight alongside us for our shared goals and our shared values. 
Among those friends are the Syrian nationals, the stateless persons and the Syrian Kurds who have a great personal risk to themselves and their families have provided an indispensable service to American military personnel during the prosecution of our fight against ISIS. 
Over 12,000 of those fighters, men and women, have given their lives fighting alongside us. Many have lost their homes, have had to travel and can't return from where they came because of the sacrifices that they make. We have friends not just because of our shared values and our goals but because historically we have stood by them. We have come to their aid just like they have come to ours. We have done that with Iraqi partners, with our Afghan partners and it's time that we do it again for our Syrian and our Kurdish partners as well. 
That's why I was proud to join with many of you and including Mr. Waltz, who like me, also served in Iraq to stand by those who have stood by us, to propose the Syrian Partner Protection Act. This is the right thing to do, not just because of our values and because our commitment matters and the American handshake should matter but because we are more safe when people know that they stand by us, we will stand by them. 
Unfortunately, it is my understanding that despite our repeated efforts and work, this amendment does not authorize additional visas, it only authorizes a program for special immigrant visas and then we would address the issue of visas later; the Congressional Budget Office has continued to score this amendment in a way that will prohibit us from proceeding with the effort at this time. 
Their fa--therefore, I am withdrawing the amendment but vow to continue to fight with all of you who share my goal to stand with our partners and in the future we will pass a program that will show that we stand by them and we will protect them and their families and we will move forward this--in the future, but unfortunately, we are forced at this time to withdraw the amendment. 
I yield back. 
DAVIS: Thank you. The gentlemen withdraws the amendment. We'll now consider the next Log which is, where are we--461. And for what purposes does the gentlemen seek recognition? Mr. Crow, this is-- 
CROW: Yeah, Madam Chair, I have another amendment at the desk. 
DAVIS: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment. The chair recognizes the gentlemen for the purpose of explaining his amendment. 
CROW: Thank you, Madam Chair. Many of you know that I've been one of the more outspoken members of Congress and of this committee on the need to end our endless wars overseas including the war in Afghanistan, which after 19 years, thousands of lives, not just American, but Afghan lives and Iraqi lives and others; trillions of dollars spent. We cannot continue on this path and at the same time meet our domestic needs and also pivot and meet the threats of Russia and China and great power competition. 
I will continue to work all of you, with all of you, and be at the forefront of efforts to reassert Congress' role in War Powers and recapturing our authorities under the AUMF and working towards ending what have become our endless wars. 
But like in every issue, there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it and I want to make sure that with respect to Afghanistan as we do this, we are doing it in the right way. See, in Afghanistan, we are not there alone. Afghanistan is the first time that our NATO partners, after 9/11, stood by us and invoked mutual self-defense and came to our aid and cont--they continue to fight and die with us today. 
There are tens of thousands of Afghan forces, men and women, who do the same who have relied on our commitment and are not quite ready to stand on their own. And there are women and children and vulnerable tribal minorities that rely on our security; without which there would be massive humanitarian crisis. 
That's the genesis of this bill. What we want to do is put guardrails in place and a process in place to ensure that as we have the discussion about reasserting congressional authority, we have the discussion about the right way to make the pivot in the drawdown forces that we do it in consideration to our allies; that we engage with them, that we engage with our coalition partners, that we ensure that we are providing some protection to women and children and vulnerable populations and we, at the same time, reassert war-making authority. 
So I want to be clear about what this amendment does not do because there's a few folks that I think have a fundamental misunderstanding. What this amendment does not do is prohibit us from withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. I would not support an effort like that. What it does do is require the administration to engage with this body, to engage with the American people to provide information and set clear criteria and standards in a deliberate method of doing so, so that we can have the discussion about how we do it and we keep the homeland safe, we prevent terrorism, we prevent a civil war in Afghanistan and we also send a clear message of keeping our commitments. That's what this bill does. 
So with that, I do ask for your support. This is a challenging and complicated issue. We've worked hard across the aisle to find the way to do it now to send a message that there is a right way to do this that our alliances and our word matter and that we are prepared as a body and as a Congress to have the tough conversations ahead. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the minute of my time. 
DAVIS: Thank you. The gentlemen reserves. Is there any debate on the amendment? Yes, please? 
WALTZ: Madam Chair, can I also speak in support of this amendment? 
DAVIS: Please. 
WALTZ: Madam Chair, I speak in support of--of this amendment. The bottom line is we have to, as a nation, stay on offense against terrorism. Intelligence officials, military officials have been clear that Al-Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, the Taliban and ISIS intend to strike the United States again and will do so if we completely remove our foot off of their neck. We must fight these wars in places abroad, not here at home. 
But further, Madam Chair, and--and to my colleague Mr. Crow, I think we need to think about Afghanistan a bit differently outside the realm of terrorism as we--as we face our adversaries and the Chinese and the Russian. If we think a moment about the geography, our major base in Afghanistan is on China's Western flank, Russia's Southern flank; clearly the Russians don't like us there and Iran's Eastern flank. That territory has been fought and bought with treasure and with blood and we need to think long and hard as an oversight body before we consider completely walking away. 
And finally, Madam Chair, and to my colleagues, I would encourage you to support this amendment. I--I do not think, and I think my colleague, Mr. Crow, has--has--has rightfully not sought to overly tie the administrations hands, but to make sure those pieces are in place, those certifications in place and that this body is consulted before we completely--or--or consider completely leaving Afghanistan. 
I support this amendment. I think we--the--the bottom line is that we didn't lose in South Vietnam. South Vietnam didn't fall, to use a historical analogy, when we withdrew our troops. It happened when we withdrew our funding after the troops. I--I just wanted to express my disappointment in the cuts in Afghan Security Forces Fund, in the Counterterrorism fund and Iraq. 
DAVIS: Okay. 
WALTZ: That is our long-term strategy and just as the South Korean Army is now able to stand on its own and other armies are able to stand on their own after years of American investment; that's the long-term strategy for the Afghan's, the Iraqi's, the Kurds and others to be able to stand on their own and I would encourage my colleagues to oppose additional cuts to those funds. That is our long-term strategy to eventually be able to bring our troops home and I yield. 
DAVIS: Thank you. Mr. Moulton? 
MOULTON: Thank you, Madam Chair. I would just like to share my support for this amendment as well. And I think it's important to acknowledge what's going on right now as we have this debate. We're debating this amendment because President Trump, the man who claims he wrote The Art of the Deal, is dealing in human lives with the Taliban. 
There's been bipartisan criticism of what a weak da--deal he got with the Taliban, a deal that's already falling apart. But now we learn that he was making this deal at the same time as there were bounties on the heads of American troops, American sons and daughters. We clearly need more oversight over what the president is doing in Afghanistan. 
I'd like to see the longest war in American history come to a close as well but I don't want to see it--to see it come to a close at the expense of our national security or at the expense of our troops. Madam Chair, I yield back. 
DAVIS: The gentleman yields back. Is there any other debate on the amendment? Yes, Mr. Gaetz? 
GAETZ: Thank you, Madam Chair, the next amendment, I presume my friend Mr. Khanna of California, will seek to reassert Congress' War Powers as it relates to Yemen. And many of my Republican colleagues will debate against that War Powers amendment and they'll argue that it unfairly restricts the administration's--or it unfairly ties their hands. But here many Republicans are going to support Mr. Crow's amendment that, in fact, ties the administrations hands when it comes to leaving Afghanistan. You know, the--the gentlemen said there's always a right way and a wrong way to leave. I would say that a great nation does not force the next generation to fight their wars and that's what we've done in Afghanistan. 
I think the best day to have not had the war in Afghanistan was when we started it and the next best day is tomorrow. I don't think there's ever a bad day to end the war in Afghanistan. Our generation is weary of this and tired of this and what this amendment does is it puts additional barriers in front of the administration as they would try to leverage or withdraw and get the best conditions we can and--and certainly Afghanistan's a dangerous place. The gentlemen from Colorado said, well, you know, we might be able to prevent an Afghan civil war. It is not my expectation that we are preventing a whole lot of violence there now. You see the extent to which the administrative districts at the Afghan government is controlling is--is declining, not rai--not raising as a consequence of our continued involvement. 
Even the military and governmental officials that were executing the war, did not have a vision for victory and knew that we were entangled in--in a quagmire as it was going on. We know this is a consequence of the Afghan papers. Mr. Khanna and I have called on the committee to hold hearings on the Afghan papers so that we can ascertain the extent to which our government was negligent-- 
UNKNOWN: Okay. 
GAETZ: --with the most precious resource our country has and that's the blood of our bravest patriots. I know that there are desires to continue to have American taxpayers invest in the Afghani security forces to a greater and greater degree. I'm sure ultimately they'll be some defense contractors that do very well on those deals but like pardon me if I'd just like to make our country great again before we make Kandahar great again. And I think that's, while on this committee that might not be a popular view, I think when we get to the broader Congress, if you've got the right wing populists like myself and the left-wing populists that are members of the majority party working together, you know, it's going to be hard to stand against where a majority of the American people are and that is against this war. 
I yield back. 
DAVIS: The gentlemen yields. Is there further debate on the amendment? Mrs. Cheney? 
CHENEY: Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. I--I want to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr. Crow, for his very diligent work on this. This--this is a very careful amendment, very careful piece of legislation that focuses on what's really critical about what we need to do to protect our security and what needs to be done in Afghanistan. We need to make sure that we're denying terrorists safe havens, we need to make sure that we are able to continue counterterrorism activity. 
You know, I listened to my colleague, Mr. Gaetz, say that, ""We started it."" And I--I would just urge everyone in this room, and I know all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle recognize how flawed that assessment is. We didn't start this, we were attacked on 9/11. and the reality of the situation is, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, a number of those same terrorist groups continued to operate in Afghanistan. In fact, we have reports that Ayman al-Zawahiri has been in Afghanistan recently; he may be there now. 
So, we have an obligation as we look at how we're going to be able to continue to protect this nation, to do it in a way that is responsible. This amendment has a waiver. It does not, as my colleague Mr. Gaetz said, tie the president's hands. But what it does do is it lays out in a very responsible level of specificity what is going to be required if we are going to, in fact, make decisions about troop levels based on conditions on the ground and based on what's required for our own security; not based on political timelines. 
And--and that is crucially important and I think it is our number one priority and I think if there's any question about our objectives in Afghanistan, you know, I think we can be very clear that our objectives are to deny terrorists safe havens. Our objectives are to ensure that we have sufficient forces there so that terrorists cannot plot and plan and launch attacks against us again and that is absolutely crucial for us to be able to maintain our security. So I support this amendment and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it. And I yield back. 
DAVIS: Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. Are there any other further debate? Is there any other further debate on the amendment? No? Under-- Okay. I was going to say two words but I can-- That's okay. 
SMITH: Thank you. I appreciate that. Just to confirm, any further debate? All good. All those in favor of Mr. Crow's amendment, yes, will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed will say, no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: Opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. Roll call vote is requested so further--further consideration of this amendment will be held until the end when we go through the roll call votes. And give me just one brief moment. All right, apologies. 
It is now in order to consider Log number 362. For what purposes does the gentlelady from Texas seek recognition? 
ESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and the gentlewoman from Texas is recognized to--for--for the purposes of explaining her amendment. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. The Fiscal Year 2018 NDAA established an ecommerce model to provide federal agencies opportunities to access ecommerce procurement opportunities; a program managed by the GSA. Essentially we are paying a portal provider to serve the federal government and run the portal. Last year, I raised a concern brought to me by small businesses in my district. While they were eager to participate in the portal and compete in this process, they were concerned that this structure might, in fact, ultimately limit competition and push them out of being able to compete in the new ecommerce marketplace. 
Their concern, one rooted in a pattern we've unfortunately seen before, was that the provider would gain access to their information and turn around and use it to compete against them. Unfortunately, the commercial sector has proven the frequency of third-party data abuses in ecommerce marketplaces. 
So I proposed an amendment supported by this committee in--and--and--and was in the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA that directed the pilot tests to include a platform that would not allow the portal provider to also act as a seller on the platform in order to allow a fair test of diff--different models. GSA chose not to do that. What we have now is an e-marketplace platform provider that can offer its own products with the potential to eliminate competition in the way my small businesses feared. 
My amendment seeks to fix that flaw, protect competition and protect small businesses. My amendment--amendment simply says that a company may not, both, get paid to run an online sales platform for the federal government and use information they gather from that platform in order to compete against those participating in the platform in order to undercut them and sell their own merchandise. 
My amendment does not prevent any company from participating in the pilot program or in the subsequent award. My amendment strengthens this important program by ensuring robust supplier competition. This is a value I believe we all share. I thank the Oversight and Small Business Committees for granting waivers in recognition of the importance of these guardrails. Unfortunately, the commercial sector has proven the potential for, and the frequency of, third-party data abuses in ecommerce marketplaces. 
Congress has held hearings on this issue and heard time and again about companies using data they collect and then create their own competing products to undercut small businesses and other suppliers. These anticompetitive issues remain the subject of investigations in Congress by state attorneys general as well as in other forums. The current administration is also investigating the presence of these--of dangerous counterfeit goods on commercial ecommerce portals. Here is the Department of Homeland Security report on this very issue discussing their national security and competitiveness concerns. 
Knowing the same companies are vying for the GSA e-commerce portal proves the necessity of these guardrails. These companies, some of you may have heard from--from my opposing--have heard from opposing my amendment, and would prefer to both get paid to run the platform for the government and to use it to sell their own merchandise with no guardrails to protect competition. 
I don't think this is the model we should or want to set as we begin piloting this important program to modernize procurement; my colleagues small businesses are depending on us to protect them especially now after they have been fighting to stay afloat during COVID. 
My amendment is supported by the National Association of Wholesale--Wholesaler Distributors because it ensures there's a firewall that protects American small businesses. I understand this is a challenging issue. I will continue to work with the chairman. I will continue to monitor this over the next 12 months. I reserve action for next year's NDAA should I still be here. And with that, I will withdraw my amendment. 
SMITH: The gentlelady withdraws the amendment and I--we've talked about this issue and I am very sympathetic to--to the approach. We just want to make sure that we move the program forward because I do think that the availability of e-commerce within DOD is important but the issue that Ms. Escobar raises is also important. If those who are in charge of the portal are also able to direct people towards their products, there is a competitive problem there and the whole point in creating the e-commerce portals is to increase competition and efficiency. So we'll continue to work with you on that and I appreciate you withdrawing the amendment at this time. 
It is now in order to consider Log number 443r1. For what purpose does the gentlelady from Texas seek recognition? 
ESCOBAR: I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Thank you. Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading of the amendment and, Ms. Escobar, is recognized for the purposes of explaining her amendment. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to first recognize, acknowledge and thank my colleagues, Congressman Brown and Congressman Keating for their work on this amendment and for their vision and their commitment to this issue. 
The Insurrection Act is a centuries old law intended as military leadership has affirmed for the most extreme of circumstances. Our consensus amendment provides commonsense oversight for the rare instance where this authority might be warranted; congressional consultation and a certification by the president that the situation merits a military response. 
Governments have many tools at their disposal. As countless military leaders have affirmed since the president's inflammatory comments sending active duty into American neighborhoods is an authority to be used for the most extreme of circumstances; an absolute last resort. We apply similar checks to use force abroad. If the president truly must use military force against Americans, against our constituents, Congress, as a coequal branch, must be able to assess the appropriateness of that usage. This is too important for Congress not to--not to exercise appropriate oversight. 
I urge my colleagues to support. I yield back. 
BYRNE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this amendment. If you understand how we got the Insu--In--Insurrection Act in its present form, I think you'd see that this is a big mistake. Now while it was originally passed in 1807, it was amended in 1861 in order to give the government the power to use troops in the south during the Civil War. It was amended again in 1871 because they didn't feel like they had enough power to do what they needed to do to protect freed blacks from the Ku Klux Klan and then it was amended a l--again, with the co--Posse Comitatus Act a little bit later in the 1870s. 
It--unfortunately it had to be used during reconstruction. President Grant had to use it in South Carolina and Louisiana. President Eisenhower had to use it in Little Rock, Arkansas. President Kennedy had to use it in all these times against the--the governor's request. President Kennedy had to use it in Mississippi and Alabama in the 1960s. 
It's been used in riots across America by Democratic presidents, it's been used by Republican presidents like George H. W. Bush to respond to matters where the governors were asking to come in. There are times when things just fall apart and we need our president to have the power to do what's necessary to protect the American people; whether it's free blacks during reconstruction or whether it's people who were being blocked from being able to integrate our schools during the civil rights era. 
There are also times where it's necessary for the president to step in because there's a failure, complete failure, and breakdown in local and state leadership as I've talked about earlier with regard to New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. 
The truth of the matter is, is that we've had this law for 228 years. It's rarely used and limiting the president's authority is generally unnecessary and unwise when the dem--dynamics in play involves violence and potential threats to innocent lives. Diluting the president's authority by giving Congress power to terminate his response could adversely and unnecessary--unnecessarily impact the effectiveness of that response. 
Now, let's be clear, this has come up because of what President Trump said a few weeks ago. We know from the briefing we all sat in on with the Secretary of the Army, that the president never ever used the Insurrection Act. Any proposed change in this law because of that is an award to infringement upon the authority of any president. And I beg people in this room, when you do this, take President Trump out of your mind, because there are going to be presidents down the road who are not going to be President Trump and you are limiting them with these sorts of things. 
If we had done what is proposed in this amendment, it would have threatened what President Eisenhower had to do in Arkansas, what President Kennedy had to do in Mississippi and Alabama. Surely the majority does not intend that. So I would ask all of us to think through both the historic development of this law and how it's been historically used and also think through what we would be doing to limit future presidents that need this power and don't need Congress to be limiting them when they have to respond in a moment of great danger to people in local area and perhaps across an entire state. 
So, I understand that there are concerns about wh--what the president said a few weeks ago, I publicly said that I did not think he should use the Insurrection Act, and I was quoted in the National Press about that, but I don't think that's a--a basis for us to tie the hands of him or any future president when we know that this is rarely, rarely, rarely used. 
ESCOBAR: Would the gentleman yield? 
BYRNE: Just one second. But when it was used, it was used because it had to be used. And we want presidents to use it when it has to be used and I do yield to the gentlelady. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you so much. And I don't disagree with you. This truly just as a coequal branch of government is requiring consultation with Congress-the governing body closest to the people. And so I--I--I would request that with an open mind-- 
BYRNE: But--taking my time back, your bill goes beyond that and I don't--I don't have time to go into it, but you've got some other things in your bill besides that and they do place a limit on the president's power. 
ESCOBAR: The bills different-- 
BYRNE: Not just consul-- 
ESCOBAR: --than the amendment. 
BYRNE: It's not just consultation. There's more to it than that and I think before we do something like that, we ought to listen to what we're going to hear next week from the Secretary of Defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We should probably have further hearings and talk more about this because for a lot of people, this is all new. But to try to do this through an amendment on this bill when we've just been made aware of some of these facts in the last few weeks, I think is precipitous and I think it's going to lead to bad law. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Gallego? 
GALLEGO: Thank you. And I think one of the things I'd like to note is that, you know, Representative Byrne just ran through the history of the Insurrection Act and part of that history is how many times it has been amended. So clearly it's been amended to fit with the time and the necessity and I think what we have right now is Representative Escobar is saying that this is a new change that needs to occur while at the same time recognizing that the president needs to have the authority to be able to move fast and swiftly. 
So a couple of things to note; what I see right now is a--both prudent and small check on the president. So what are we asking for? Congressional consultation and a certification by the president that the situation merits a military response. So then many of us, many of you, Republicans and Democrats, we were all texting around that time, is this is the right thing to do? And we had legitimate questions about what was happening and I think that that's something that's meritorious that she has in this amendment. Lastly, if there is a--you know, a fear, and the fear is, are we tying the president's hands to the point where given an emerging situation, which can happen, we have seen it, and Representative Byrne is correct, we have seen the Insurrection Act being used for--for good reasons where we needed to bring law and order to very malicious situations; last one, at least I remember correctly, was the Rodney King riots of 1992, right? I think we all agree that that was necessary and--and a good use of the Insurrection Act, and of course, all the actions that were done during the--the desegregation actions of the 1950s and 1960s. 
But even with that being said, Representative Escobar's amendment actually has enough room to make sure the president can use this emergency powers when necessary. So, she's providing enough leeway for any president, not just President Trump, whoever the next president should be, now or into the future, but also providing at least a minimal checks to that power, right? And we've done it before. Representative Byrne you just recognized that this insurrection has been amendment a few, couple of times. I think this is a slight and moderate amendment that I think we could all agree that provides the balance that we need, which is power to the president to be able to keep law in order, while at the same time giving Congress a certain amount of check to make sure that it's not abused. 
Thank you and I yield back my time. 
WALTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colleagues, I just want to clarify that in this most recent response to civil unrest which--which obviously has--has initiated this amendment, the only reason, as we learned from our testimony with Secretary of the Army McCarthy, the only reason active duty forces were being considered and were positioned outside of D.C. was that they were part of a ready brigade that could move quickly when National Guard forces were--were--were going to take more time. They were never used, they were sent home within days and the entire time what we saw were National Guard forces under the authority of their governor, Title 32 as we've discussed earlier, who are trained in civil unrest and support to civilian authorities who are trained to reinforce law enforcement and are used from natural disasters throughout our history to this type of--to this type of unrest. 
But this amendment, yes to my colleague it--it--it--it does amend the Insurrection Act but it goes too far. It also gives Congress the authority to terminate the president's use of the Insurrection Act and--and I think we are not considering a whole myriad of--of incidences where this could potentially be used. I don't want a future commander and chief having to consult, certify and potentially be terminated by Congress in things such as--in far more serious pandemics that maybe perhaps affect our food supply, our water supply, our ports. Perhaps crippling cyber-attacks, terrorists with WMD; a whole host of situations where this mother may I, back to Congress, which is really what this is and the ability to then terminate a multi-century law, could be something that we all regret. I--I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment and I yield. 
SMITH: Mr. Garamendi? 
GARAMENDI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It really would take a few minutes for us to read this amendment and were we to do so and somehow disconnect ourselves from the most recent incidents here in Washington, D.C., I suspect we might say this is a pretty good thing to do. The Insurrection Act is no small matter and the employment of it is certainly a big matter and we've heard several examples of where it has been employed in the past. Two parts to this amendment. The first part said that the president has to justify it and the justi--and the articles, or the id--the things that must be justified are--are perfectly sensible. 
I'll allow you to read, you should read those. I think we would want the president to have at least justification before he took action. All of those things that are called for here would seem to be just the prior to any action that should be known by the president, writing it out and sending it to Congress allows him to take the action. 
The second part of this amendment deals with the power of Congress to override, or to terminate, the presidential action and I should think we would want that. Not in a willy-nilly way but in a way that would require both houses of Congress to, by a majority vote, take action to--to terminate the insurrection action that the president has taken. That is very sensible. I--I think it was just yesterday we passed off the floor a disallowance of a regulation. It's not going to pass the Senate. The Senate and, in fact, this body, both bodies, a couple of weeks--yea--two years ago, disallowed a regulation, or several regulations for that matter. 
It's a balance of power here and an insurrection action by the president is no small matter. So what Ms. Escobar has put before us is a very balanced authority in which the president must have reasons and state the reasons for the use of the Insurrection Act and should Congress disagree, both houses, in a very clear way disapprove and terminate the actions of the president. That's a balance of power that we're going to need now and into the future. 
SMITH: The gentleman's time has expired. 
GARAMENDI: Thank you. With that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Lamborn? 
LAMBORN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to ask the sponsor to interpret something for me. I--I'm reading the first paragraph of your language and it says, whenever unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion against the authority of the United States make an impractical--impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States and any state by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the president may call on a federal services such as the militia of any state and use such of the armed forces as the president considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion. 
Would what happened in Seattle--CHAZ, and it became CHOP, the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, would that have qualified, in your opinion, as an unlawful obstruction, combination or assemblage or rebellion? 
SMITH: Would the gentlemen yield for just a quick second here? So, what you're reading there is actually existing law; that's not Ms. Escobar's amendment; just--just to be clear. And you're asking here to make the legal--you're asking here to play president for one particular situation and one particular place. That--I mean, whether we pass this or not, that questions going to have to be answered by whatever president is out there in terms of using the underlying Insurrection Act and really doesn't have anything to do with her amendment. 
Now, you're free to, I guess, have that intellectual conversation if you want, but that's not the purpose of--of what she's offering. That's whether or not the president can do the Insurrection Act. We're talking about what--what limits we might place on that decision, if that makes sense? So, she didn't write that language, that's existing law. 
LAMBORN: Well, it's throughout a--it appears time after time and--and it says that it has to be certified to Congress that this is taking place. That is new language. 
SMITH: The certification. 
LAMBORN: Yeah. So woul--would that have been certified as something-- I'm trying to understand where this would apply and where it would not apply. 
ESCOBAR: And, Mr. Lamborn, the--the--the-- So the president would then have to explain to us why he would want to send out troops into Seattle basically to confront American citizens as they are protesting and you know, and I will say, that the--certification essentially means tell us your plan, tell us your plan. Many of us, including Secretary Esper, were caught basically unaware of the president's decision or his effort or his thoughts about sending troops into American cities. You had our own secretary-- 
LAMBORN: Okay, would that have applied in Seattle, in your opinion? 
ESCOBAR: Well, so that would have been up to the president if he would have-- 
LAMBORN: You don't have an opinion? 
ESCOBAR: The--the--I would have wanted to weigh the equities. I would have wanted to hear the debate and--and--and see the-- 
LAMBORN: What's an insurrection? 
SMITH: The gentleman's time has expired. 
LAMBORN: What's an insurrection? 
SMITH: The gentleman's time has--has expired. If I may, Ms. Escobar, I think you should take this as an extreme compliment, Mr. Lamborn is imagining you as president of the United States of America. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Right now in this situation and you are charged with fixing our problems in Seattle. So chew on that one. 
ESCOBAR: I'll need more than five minutes. 
SMITH: Yeah, I--I would hope so. And only three, actually. All right, Ms. Haaland? 
HAALAND: Thank you, chairman. I'd like to thank my colleague, Ms. Escobar, for her amendment and I would like to yield my time to her. 
ESCOBAR: Thank you so much, Congresswoman Haaland. Here--here's what I would like everyone to realize, the--the--actually, I want to take us back to the moment of the--the days and the weeks when Americans were responding in the streets to the brutality of the murder of George Floyd. In that moment for many Americans this was the only way that they could respond to what--what we have all, I hope, come to recognize as a moment that commanded change. 
We--I think we can all agree that the president has his powers they--they are written in the constitution, we understand those powers, but we also understand the fact that there need to be checks and balances so that there is not abuse of power or an abuse of authority. As Chairman Garamendi mentioned, this is actually a very modest request of Congress, and that is that before--and--and--and I will tell you, I have taken to heart the fact that this is not about one president. This is about the powers of any president, of any person who is president. In--we have now seen how far the limits have been stretched on the Insurrection Act and how far they could have gone. 
The question for us is whether we believe there should be checks and balances, where we believe that we are a coequal branch of government, and--and whether we believe there should be at a minimum if our government is going to use troops against our own people. There should be a plan through certification and whether Congress should be consulted. I think that is very little to ask. I think it is a very modest amendment, and again, I would urge my colleagues to support. Thank you, Ms. (INAUDIBLE) I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it just goes too far. Mr. Chairman, in this amendment, it says, demonstrable evidence, demonstrable evidence. A governor who is not acting at all, you can't provide something--for something that is not there. So, no action at all or inaction is very hard to provide demonstrable evidence. A governor who is saying out of his--his or her mouth, I'm going to take care of this. I'm going to do this but is doing no actions to respond, there is no demonstrable evidence to show that they have no intention to respond. 
Further, to say that it doesn't go very far, section 275 of this amendment, restriction on direct participation by military personnel, I would argue that goes very far. I would say, once again, the fear of what President Trump might do is driving us to make bad law. I can tell you this. If it was left to Congress in 1962, James Meredith would not have been admitted into Ole Miss because they would've kicked it around Congress, and they would've kicked it around the Senate and House. And no action would have been taken because there weren't enough votes. Sometimes, right is not a popularity vote. It's the right thing to do. 
If there is something that happens and he abuses that authority, there are remedies for him or her, the president abusing that. But we are making a bad knee-jerk decision that has no place right now over the fears that President Trump might have invoked the Insurrection Act, which he did not. We do not need to continue to have knee-jerk reactions on what might be and what could be and what should be. We need to look at the facts and what happened, and this is an overreach of our authority. And it is done in response to what we feared might have happened. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Thank you, and I yield to--to myself for the moment. I--I think we--we have misunderstood what--what--what is before us, and--and I honestly believe that. I think there's people on both sides of this who--who want to have this implemented correctly. And I think the correct statement would be in what was initially introduced and what some of the bills that were initially introduced, yeah, that--that was a knee-jerk reaction. What we have worked out in--in consultation here is I think a very common-sense approach to have Congress at least be informed of what's going on. Congress, under this amendment, can only stop the president from using the Insurrection Act if we pass by a majority vote in the House and the Senate. 
And as a practical manner, it then has to be signed by the president. Now, if the president is of the opinion that he is correctly using the Insurrection Act, then that's probably not going to happen. So, as a practical matter, all this does is it says if two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate disagree, then they will overturn the action of the president. Now, there was an earlier version of this that said after two weeks the president's invocation of the Insurrection Act goes away unless Congress approves it. 
That's what we decided not to do, okay. So, Mr. Kelly, in your situation, the--the only way the National Guard would not have been allowed to protect Mr. Meredith at the University of Mississippi is if two-thirds of the Congress decided not to. Now, I--I think that is a reasonable inclusion of the legislative branch in this process. Now, the only other piece of this is upfront he has--she--he or she in the future has to notify us that he's doing it. Yes, in notifying us, he has to basically say, I'm doing it, and here's the reason. He doesn't have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. He doesn't have to prove it, period, okay. I mean, theoretically, in a certification, he could say, I'm doing it because I think it's the right thing to do. You are so notified, okay. 
Yeah, there's requirements in there, but it--it basically just says, as Ms. Escobar I think made clear, he has to have a reason. He has to state that reason. That's the balance that we're trying to strike. I can tell you whatever may have started out on this, it is not our intent at this point to simply do this in response to President Trump. 
KELLY: Mr. Chairman, will you yield one second? 
SMITH: In one quick second. It is--it is our-- 
KELLY: --It says demonstrable-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry. I did not yield. 
KELLY: I'm sorry. 
SMITH: Just one--one second. It is our intent to say that Congress ought to have some say in the process, which they do not now have because of the way we passed the law. This requires notification and then gives us the power to overturn that decision if we so choose. And I--I personally think that strikes the right balance. But yes, I will yield to Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: Mr. Chairman, it clearly says demonstrable evidence. 
SMITH: Yeah. 
KELLY: Which has a legal definition which is much broader than what you just described. Demonstrable evidence has a legal definition which is a requirement much greater than just the president saying, I did it because I had a whim. 
SMITH: Yeah, and no, I think, that--that's fair. Demonstrable evidence does set a standard, but do we really envision a situation where a president is not--well, if he can't show us demonstrable evidence, then I don't think he--she should use the Insurrection Act. He should be able to show us demonstrable evidence. I have other people that say, I'm--I'm--Mr. Mitchell. 
MITCHELL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Let me start by making a point. Mr. Lamborn's question wasn't about whether my colleague was president, but if in fact, under the terms of this amendment, what she determined that Seattle, that CHAZ was grounds for the president to invoke the Insurrection Act under the terms of this amendment, and though, frankly, for the record, she didn't answer the question, despite the fact it was put forward. 
SMITH: Will the gentleman yield for just a quick second--question on that? 
MITCHELL: If I--if I keep my time I will, sir. 
SMITH: Certainly. Just a quick question is--the question there is that's demonstrable evidence. If the president could show demonstrable evidence, but it sort of implies that as a member of Congress we would have the power to say, no, I'm sorry, that doesn't qualify. 
MITCHELL: Let's--let's talk about that. 
SMITH: Sure. 
MITCHELL: Is that--I'll ask the question too, Mr. Chair. Is that demonstrable evidence? 
SMITH: I--I think if the president wanted to say it was, I doubt we could legally overturn him on that because that would go to the courts. 
MITCHELL: With all due respect, you haven't answered the question, sir. Is it in your opinion demonstrable evidence that they should invoke it? 
SMITH: And I will give you the answer Ms. Escobar gave you. I hope no future president will answer that question in 10 seconds. 
MITCHELL: With all due respect, but that's the issue we have here is that-- 
SMITH: --We're not saying he has 10 seconds-- 
MITCHELL: --this language has--this language is--is specifically about what President Trump uttered, and if we modify language-- 
SMITH: --No, it's not-- 
MITCHELL: --if you make amendments to bills, every chance, every time the president says something we don't like, we don't have any time to do anything else around here. Let's be honest about it. So, let me make a couple of other points, and I'll--and I'll just drop it. The reality is that it says the president must consult with Congress in all instances. It doesn't say, well, when you get to us. It doesn't say later. It must--he must do that in advance and certify it with demonstrable evidence. I--I've read it, Ms. Escobar. It's--it's--""every possible instance"" is what it says, to quote it specifically. 
Now, we know there's instances, Mr. Waltz has mentioned that we could have significant issues going on that we don't--he doesn't have the ability to consult with us. Define consulting. Define it in a way that in fact it could be achieved as you saw those circumstances, where in fact we were under attack, cyber-attack, pandemic attack. We're dealing with one right now that has us meeting like this and meeting on--on the internet because we can't get together. And that was just allegedly an accident, an unfortunate pandemic. How's he going to consult? 
We are--in my opinion, we're taking an action here because of some ill-advised comment the president made, and yes, God, those who led the media. Should never have been said. Should never have been suggested, but we're going to make life miserable for a president trying to deal with a major issue in the future to make people feel better today about something that was said, and that is not why we're here in this Congress. Absolutely, the time I have left. Thank you. 
UNKNOWN: So, it wasn't about simply a threat. We all witnessed what happened in Lafayette Square. So, we have seen--we have seen-- 
UNKNOWN: --Okay. 
MITCHELL: (INAUDIBLE) I've got 27 seconds. So, let's just admit it. On the other side of the aisle, it is about what Trump said--it's my time, and I've got 18 seconds. What Trump said and about Lafayette Park. Lafayette Park was one of the most ill-advised things I've seen in my life, but that doesn't mean we take centuries' old legislation, and we change it because he's irritated the hell out of us. That's not why we're here. 
SMITH: Mr. Brown. 
BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Quite frankly, I'm--I'm baffled. I'm baffled at this conversation--this--this discussion. I wasn't excited about--as the chairman mentioned the first iteration of this amendment because it would've required Congress to act within two weeks or it would be sunsetted, and quite frankly, I don't think we in Congress can act on weighty measures on most anything in two weeks. So, I'm glad that it came in in the format that it did, and it's rather simple, right. Consult with Congress. It doesn't say what the consultation has to be, and it can be--it can be fairly (INAUDIBLE) 
It says certify. There are three elements to the certification in this amendment. Compare that to Mr. Crow's amendment, which we just recently seemingly passed on voice vote. It'll go to a recorded vote later. I think there's three or four pages of certification. The allegation, if you will, that somehow this is a knee-jerk reaction to President Trump's comment, you've got to ask yourself, why is it then that just one hour ago we voted in favor of Congress' participating in the prosecution of a war in Afghanistan. Congress has never done that before. An hour ago, we said that you cannot withdraw troops from Afghanistan. 
We will withdraw hold funding unless you do it a whole lot of things. Congress has never done that. Yeah, Congress may have in South Korea. We did it, I think two--two years ago, said, no, we'll maintain station there. We just did it on Mr. Gallego's amendment. Peace time stationing. Never have we said to a wartime president, we will defund a withdrawal, but we did this. Why? In reaction to President Trump. A knee-jerk reaction. Simply because a measure's being proposed in this committee during the course of this president's--the Trump presidency doesn't mean it's a knee-jerk. 
He may have said something. He may have done something. He raises an important issue, and that issue is what will congressional involvement be when the Insurrection Act is invoked. And there are many of us that believe that Congress has a role. This is minimal. Finally, on demonstrable evidence, that means nothing other than demonstrate. It's not beyond a reasonable doubt. It's not clear and convincing. It's not, you know, the preponderance of evidence. There's no standard there. It's just demonstrated. It could be a scintilla of evidence, just demonstrate that you have a need. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: (OFF-MIC) Okay. I have Mr. Khanna. Mr. Khanna, did you hear me? 
KHANNA: Yes, is this-- 
SMITH: --We got you. Go ahead. 
KHANNA: Yeah, I read amendment after this. 
SMITH: Sorry, no. I thought you'd want to be recognized to speak on--on this amendment. 
KHANNA: No. 
SMITH: If you don't, we'll conclude, and then, we'll get to you in just a second. 
KHANNA: Thank you. 
SMITH: Ms., sorry, Stefanik. 
STEFANIK: I yield to Mr. Byrne. 
BYRNE: Thank you. The very last provisions of this bill, Mr. Chairman, says restriction on direct participation by military personnel. Now, the way the law works is, is that the Insurrection Act, even though it was passed before the Posse Comitatus Act, the Insurrection Act is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. You're now putting the restrictions of Posse Comitatus Act on the Insurrection Act, which is this new Section 275. That's never been done before. Imagine General Grant trying to root out the Ku Klux Klan with that provision. 
Imagine a white supremacist army taking over a part of one of our cities or our town, how is a president going to root them out if you have that limitation in there? This has not been thought out. We need to stop and take the time to do it right because you make mistakes like that in a bill like this, and a president will come up later and say, I can't do anything about it when the governor says, my National Guard can't control this. My State police can't control this. I need the 82nd airborne unit, and the president says, I can't put them in there because they can't do the things that are limited by Congress in this law. 
I don't think this has been thought through, and I wish we would stop and take the time to listen to what we're going to hear next week in the hearing, take the time to have our own hearing in general about it, get some legal people to come here and talk to us about it, so we know exactly what we're doing instead of what is clearly a knee-jerk response. With that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Does anybody else seek recognition? Mr. Wittman. 
WITTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield to Mr. Lamborn. 
LAMBORN: I thank the gentleman. As we've been sitting here, I just got a notice of an article that's coming out in the Wall Street Journal tomorrow or Saturday about what happened in Minneapolis. What happened in Minneapolis is that a police precinct building was abandoned to rioters who set it on fire and did other things and occupied it, and the mayor of Minneapolis said, let--you know, let it go. Just don't do anything, and all the police pulled back, thinking that they were going to prevent that from happening. 
And it says, it touched off a debate over whether the building's abandonment helped save lives in Minneapolis or inspired more violence and destruction in the Twin Cities and elsewhere across the country during this summer's protest against police brutality. So, you know, those kinds of occupations can have potentially widespread effects. So, once again, I raise my question to the sponsor or the chairman, would that have been qualified under this language that we're supposed to endorse and pass if--if they have their way, is that an unlawful obstruction that qualifies for the president to take action. I mean, I want to know the context. 
SMITH: Will the gentleman yield? 
LAMBORN: These are real world events that are happening today-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry-- 
LAMBORN: --And that's why you're bringing the amendment. I want to know if this applies. 
SMITH: Gentleman, will you yield? 
LAMBORN: Yes. 
SMITH: Would you--I mean, how about answering the question. Let's say we don't pass this amendment, okay. The Insurrection Act has to be invoked, so I'll ask you, without this amendment, without what you guys are calling a knee-jerk reaction, which it's not. It's actually well thought out, you know. Throw this amendment in the garbage. Pretend we're just having a debate over the Insurrection Act. Would that qualify for the president to use the Insurrection Act in your opinion? 
LAMBORN: I'm like Bradley Byrne. I think that the Insurrection Act should only be used as a totally last resort, and I've told that to the press-- 
SMITH: --Sir, you're not answering the question either (INAUDIBLE)-- 
LAMBORN: --No, I would--I would not have used it myself. 
SMITH: In the case of Minneapolis? 
LAMBORN: Yeah. 
SMITH: Okay. Well, that's--that's all we're asking the president to do is what you did right there is to say, here's the reason, and you know, I mean, up down, one way or the other, it doesn't matter whether or not we in this moment think that Seattle or Minneapolis. It matters that if the president makes that decision, he has to tell us why. That's what this does. 
LAMBORN: But we're tying his hands. We're changing the law that's been on the books for centuries. I think it's an over--it's a knee-jerk overreaction. I disagree with Mr. Brown. It's an anti-Trump overreaction. That's plain and simple, and that's all it is. I yield back. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia. 
WITTMAN: I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Okay, Ms. Trahan. 
TRAHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I--I'm having trouble understanding the allegiance to centuries' old statute when we have a president who's capable of making what could've been an irresponsible decision, right. I don't understand the resistance to evolving our laws and calling for more checks and balances when they're tested by a president who is going to call up troops on--on peaceful protestors. You know, this president has shown us the danger of the Insurrection Act powers wielded for political purposes. 
And I support this--this amendment because it's a commonsense oversight in the rare moment when the authority granted the president under the--under the Insurrection Act must be used. So, this is not knee-jerk. This is just us evolving with our laws and our checks and balances when we are tested by a commander-in-chief, a president, to the likes we've never seen before. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Carbajal. 
CARBAJAL: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll yield my time to Representative Brown. 
BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (OFF-MIC) 
SMITH: Your--your mic. I don't think your microphone's on, sir. 
BROWN: Mr. Byrne and--and Mr. Kelly, you raise a--an important concern, right. Like, I certainly would not want to see what had seen any president unable to send in forces to--to enforce a civil rights legislation, but you--you--I think you pointed to the wrong section of the bill. So, somehow, your suggestion that--that the amendment that Representative Escobar is inserting a new provision and law. And you point to page six and seven, that says that you can't use the active military. Well, guess what? That's existing law. 
She's not writing--it's in here. I've got it right here. 
BYRNE: (OFF-MIC) 
BROWN: --10US--(INAUDIBLE)--it's my time. It's my-- 
BYRNE: (OFF-MIC) 
BROWN: --I'm--I'm not reclaiming my time. I'm keeping my time. It's 10USC 275, and-- 
BYRNE: (OFF-MIC) 
BROWN: --And--and it says-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Byrne, I'm sorry-- 
BROWN: --the exact same thing. 
SMITH: Mr. Brown--would the gentleman suspend for just a second? We--one person talking at a time. It's Mr. Brown's time. 
BYRNE: Will I have a chance to respond? 
SMITH: You know the rules, Mr. Byrne. 
BYRNE: Okay, I won't. 
SMITH: If you want to get someone to yield to you, then we can continue the debate. But don't act aggrieved. You have your time, as everyone else has their time. 
BYRNE: Yes, sir. 
SMITH: If someone wishes to yield to you, we will do that. 
BYRNE: Yes, sir. 
SMITH: We don't need to be upset about it. It's Mr. Brown's time. Mr. Brown, you may continue. 
BROWN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, current law says you can't use active military unless otherwise authorized in law. That's current law. So, Representative Escobar is just taking current law, but somehow, you're sort of suggesting that she's manipulating, she's changing, she's tying the hands. The reason why I'm supporting this is it's simple. It's a three-part certification. Does demonstrate it. Give us a little bit of evidence. Just--just make a case. Enlist some of those White House lawyers and DOD general council. Make a case. Certify it. Easy. 
Consult. Just give us a call. It's not onerous. Call up the Speaker. Call up the--the leader in the Senate. Just consult. We don't--we don't put anyone through any high hurdles and hoops. Just consult, and then finally, if two-thirds of Congress, House and Senate, believe that we need to terminate it, that's a high bar. Then, it will be terminated, but don't read anymore into it than that because there's already a prohibition under the Insurrection Act of the use of active military unless otherwise authorized by law. Read Section 275 of Title 10. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Mr. Banks. 
BANKS: (OFF-MIC) 
BYRNE: So, what you read, Mr. Brown, was the Posse Comitatus Act. The Insurrection Act is, unless Congress acted otherwise, is the exception to the Posse Comitatus Act. With this bill, you're going to put the Posse Comitatus Act restrictions on the Insurrection Act, which means President Eisenhower, President Kennedy could not have put the army into Ole Miss, into University of Alabama. They could not have done it. Well, they could put them there, but they couldn't do anything because they would be limited by that law. So, you're quoting the Posse Comitatus Act, which we had the Insurrection Act as an exception to. 
So, if you don't--if you don't want the president to have the authority to do that, just say it. Just repeal the Insurrection Act because that's what that is. That is repealing the Insurrection Act. I don't think that's why we all intend to do. That's why we need to stop-- 
BROWN: --That's a distorted reading of the Insurrection Act-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry, Mr. Brown-- 
BYRNE: --Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman-- 
SMITH: --Hey, just chill. I got it here. 
BROWN: It hurts when someone interrupts, doesn't it-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown, Mr. Brown-- 
BROWN: --Right, it hurts when someone interrupts-- 
SMITH: --Mr. Brown-- 
BROWN: --And they eat up your time on the clock, doesn't it--doesn't it because you ate up about-- 
SMITH: --Anthony-- 
BROWN: --20 seconds of my time-- 
SMITH: --Are you kidding me, Anthony? 
BROWN: --As the chairman came in and had to correct both of us. 
SMITH: Anthony, please suspend. Your time-- 
BROWN: --Mr. Chairman, I respect your managing the time, and I would--I would ask that you interact with me the same way that you do with Mr. Byrne-- 
SMITH: --Can I tell you something, can I--can I--well, I did. 
BROWN: --I didn't hear--I didn't hear a first name admonition to a member who was interrupting another member, Mr. Chairman. 
SMITH: Mr. Brown, can we calm down for a second. I--I--I did that to Mr. Byrne first, and he stopped when I did it. You did not. 
BROWN: I was watching the clock, Mr. Chairman. You guys ate up 30 seconds of my time. 
SMITH: And I would've gladly given you that additional time. What I don't want is I don't want it to descend in a shouting match. As I demonstrated to Mr. Byrne, if you want more time, if the clock's--believe me. I think we've proved one thing. You will find ways to get you more time, but what I can't have is I can't have us shouting over the top of each other. That's all I'm trying to prevent. If you want more time, we'll find a way, and we'll get you more time. Nobody's been cut off. Mr. Byrne, it is your time. 
BYRNE: I yield 30 seconds to Mr. Brown. 
(LAUGHTER) 
BROWN: Thank you, and what I'm going to do is use my 30 seconds to make a very sincere, genuine apology to you, to the chairman, and to this committee. No, it is. It's a sincere apology because this committee has acted with courtesy and decorum in a bipartisan matter. Sometimes, we get heated, as I did, but I respect the process and the decorum of this committee. Thank you for yielding the time. I yield back to you. 
(APPLAUSE) 
SMITH: Thank you. Thank you, Anthony. I--we--we-- 
BYRNE: --I don't--I don't-- 
SMITH: --I'm sorry. Go ahead, it's your time. 
BYRNE: I don't mind heat because that means you care about the issue. I care about the issue too. You thought through this issue. I have too, but I don't think you or I have had enough time to think it through to get to a truly well-informed, reasoned decision about something of this magnitude. I hope no president ever has to use this again. I remember as a child when President Kennedy sent the troops into Alabama. It was awful, but he had to do it. And a future president may have to do it, and we're about to put a restriction on him, I fear, and if a legal scholar wants to come here and show me I'm wrong, I'm fine. I'm not a legal scholar. I'm just an old journeyman lawyer that had to deal with this stuff in the courts. 
But I fear if you look at the way they've done this, that we--we've really handcuffed our future president, and I know--I know you don't want that, and I don't want that either, and with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: All right. I will close off the debate by simply making the observation that Mr. Bryne, you're in luck. We're--we're not actually sending this into law tonight. This is but the first step in a--in a lengthy process. So, we will--we will have the opportunity to continue discuss--to discuss this, as we did to get to this point. With that, I'm sorry, did you-- 
UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC) 
SMITH: Okay, I'm sorry, all right. All right. All those in favor of Ms. Escobar's amendment will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: All those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: The opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. I will request a roll-call vote. Further proceedings on the amendment will be suspended, and we will have a roll call added to the rest of the list. It is now in order to consider Log 403. For what purpose does the gentlelady from Pennsylvania seek recognition? 
HOULAHAN: Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: The clerk will please distribute the amendment. Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment, and the gentlelady from Pennsylvania is recognized for five minutes. 
HOULAHAN: I hope that this will not be quite so hard. I know that many of us who have served on our--in our country in uniform were very troubled to watch as members of our National Guard were deployed in Washington as part of their response to recent protests. At the same time, we learned that the president was considering, and the Secretary of Defense was preparing to deploy active duty forces under the authorities of the Insurrection Act. Of course, the Insurrection Act was not invoked in this case, but for many Americans, especially younger Americans, it was the first time hearing that this law that was originally drafted more than 200 years ago existed. 
For many of our men and women in uniform, it was the first time since taking the sacred oath to protect and defend our nation that they imagined that they might be deployed to act against their own fellow citizens, not against a foreign adversary. I can only speak for myself, but I took that oath to protect and defend this nation, never imaging that I would be deployed against my fellow citizens. My colleagues have offered amendments to constrain or curtail otherwise increased congressional oversight to the executive branch's power under the Insurrection Act. Personally, I believe these authorities have done some good in our nation's history, and they deserve reexamination and congressional engagement. 
And I'm very glad that we're having this debate today. My debate is very, very narrow in scope. Currently, Title 10 Section 253 of the U.S. code reads, ""The president, by using the militia or the armed forces or both or by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress in a state any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination 
And then it goes on, but it never actually says what it means by ""any other means."" 
My amendment would say that any other means is limited to federal law enforcement officers who are clearly identifiable by their name and their agency. In a difficult sit--situation in which the Insurrection Act truly must be invoked, we cannot afford uncertainty in the cloud of war. Our military members are clearly identifiable in their uniforms, and so must our law enforcement officers be too. 
We have all seen the footages of civilian individuals dressed in ambiguous clothing that suggested law enforcement or military, but frankly the line is very blurry, and that blurry line puts everyone at greater risk. It's as simple as that, just asking for our law enforcement to be clearly identifiable. I very much ask for your support on this amendment. I--I reserve the balance of my time. 
SMITH: You can't do that, unfortunately. 
HOULAHAN: Okay. I yield back my time. 
SMITH: Mr--Mr. Mitchell? 
MITCHELL: Thanks, Mr. Chair. For the sake of transparency, let me share that my oldest son is a police officer, a local police officer, not a Federal police--Federal law enforcement officer. 
I generally support a provision that requires uniformed officers to display their names and insignia. I was troubled there were uniformed officers that in fact were displaying no insignia or name whatsoever on that line in Lafayette Park. 
However, the amendment's too broad in that it also includes plainclothes officers and officers conducting intel to determine what's going on behind the front lines of that protest to make sure that, in fact, further violence doesn't happen, that civilians and law enforcement aren't in danger with people with weapons, or all the other things that can happen there. I would make--I would do a second--an inferior amendment to--to this to except that--for plainclothes officers and intel, they would be excepted. But that would trigger a sequential referral, which would not be excepted. 
I think--I would ask the--the person--the--the sponsor of the amendment to rewrite for the floor an amendment that simply indicates, if they're uniformed, it has to indicate a name and what branch of law enforcement they're with, and except that we need plainclothes officers behind the scenes at a number of these events that can, in fact, defuse them if properly done. They're not intended to be behind them carry a baton. They're not wearing plainclothes at that point. But I think we need to make that exception. We're putting people at risk. 
And to be absolutely honest with you, my son has worked both sides of that. He had to work protests where he was uniformed, and he also had to work in protests that he was plainclothes. So, he recently had--very recently had to do both, and it puts people at risk. So, I oppose it in its current form. I would supported if--if reworded in that kind of manner. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chair. 
SMITH: Does anybody seek recognition? I think--Ms. Houlahan, do you want more time? 
HOULAHAN: Am I allowed to have more time? 
SMITH: Well, again-- 
MITCHELL: --Mr. Chair, if I-- 
HOULAHAN: --Well, I need to get something else-- 
MITCHELL: --If I could yield my time. I'm sorry. 
SMITH: Yeah. Well, we'll get some--Ms. Davis? 
DAVIS: (OFF-MIC) 
SMITH: Ms. Houlahan, you're recognized. 
HOULAHAN: First of all, I really want to commend you and your son for his service. And I do understand what you are asking. I think that my struggle is that we ask this very thing of our military in uniform, and it just doesn't seem to be terribly unreasonable to ask anybody in uniform that they present insignia, name, you know, where they come from as well. 
MITCHELL: (OFF-MIC) 
HOULAHAN: Of course. 
MITCHELL: I--I agree wholeheartedly with you. And that's why I say if we rework the amendment to say that, in fact, if they are in uniform, and this is--I said the insignia and the name on it so we know, the public knows where they're from. I was not happy to see that at Lafayette Park. And so, if--if reword--I would give that absolute support, because I think it's wrong to not have them identified. 
HOULAHAN: And can I reclaim my time for just a second? 
MITCHELL: Absolutely. Thank you. 
HOULAHAN: So, just a point of clarification, this is only about Federal law enforcement. And so, my understanding is that this isn't really a--a conversation. We're kind of talking across each other, and so I'm not aware that there would be any Federal law enforcement that this would be applied--applicable to. 
MITCHELL: (OFF-MIC) 
HOULAHAN: Of course. 
MITCHELL: Federal law enforcement, in a couple different agencies, did have plainclothes, my understanding is, trying to identify behind-the-scenes if there were issues. I think we just--if they don't have any, then it doesn't apply. If they do, then they--they aren't covered by it. So, it's--at that point, it's moot if there are no-- 
SMITH: --Ms--Ms-- 
MITCHELL: --Plainclothes Federal law enforcement involved at that point. 
SMITH: I'm sorry. Ms. Houlahan, would you yield for--for a moment? It sounds to me like it's possible that we could work this out. And we--we have the floor coming up. If the gentlelady would withdraw for now and then we can work on getting--because it sounds to me like there should be a plainclothes exception. But if you are in uniform--and also you have to be, I think, legitimately a plainclothes officer, not just sent out there. So, there's some details to work out here. But--and if it's--if you want the amendment, that's fine. But if it's amenable and you think we can work this out, I would offer that as a possible suggestion. 
HOULAHAN: I'm amenable to that. 
SMITH: Okay. 
DAVIS: I yield back my time. 
SMITH: Then the--the amendment will be withdrawn with the--the promise that we will get this in--included in a--a floor discussion and we will go forward on it. 
All right. It is now in order to consider Log 438. For what purpose does the gentleman from California seek recognition? 
KHANNA: Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
SMITH: Will the clerk please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we'll dispense with the reading of the amendment, and the gentleman from California is recognized for five minutes. 
KHANNA: Mr. Chairman, Yemen remains the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world. With the advent of COVID, the situation is even more dire. I want to start by recognizing Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, and I hope that this entire committee and our country can support his efforts at trying to get a peace deal. I understand that he is closer than he has ever been before, and I really applaud his efforts. 
This committee, when I first introduced a resolution a few years ago to restrict our refueling of Saudi planes, the amendment failed in this committee 19 to 42. We've come a long way since then. We passed in the House and in the Senate a War Powers Resolution to stop the refueling. And even though the president vetoed it, I do want to give the administration credit for voluntarily suspending the refueling of those Saudi planes. If you speak to Special Envoy Griffiths, he will say that that action has given us a lot more leverage (AUDIO GAP) this war to an end. 
And both Republicans and Democrats obviously helped us get the votes in the Senate and in the House. I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we can now support this amendment, which would simply say that there can be no logistical support for the Saudis in their bombing campaign upon Yemen. It's important to understand that, thanks to Representative Slotkin and others, the issue is not restricting intelligence sharing. We are trying to work to make sure the language doesn't compromise other security interests. It is simply focused on logistical support to--of the Saudis in the Yemen bombing campaign. 
And the committee voting for this now would send a tremendous message from the United States Congress that this war needs to end. It would be an affirmation of Martin Griffiths' peace process, and a continuation of the work that we have done with passing the War Powers Resolution and consistent, frankly, with the administration's suspension of refueling. 
I want to take just a (AUDIO GAP) use all my time to Representative Brown for (AUDIO GAP) in the Yemen war. And (AUDIO GAP) the debate here, and I appreciate his graciousness. But I think it's worth pointing out he's the only African-American on this entire committee. And to have people lecturing him about what the presidents in the past had to do to desegregate this country I find rich with irony. 
Frankly, Representative Brown doesn't owe anyone an apology. Our country has a lot more apologizing to do for the harms to the African-American community that we've had. And so, I'd just ask that all of us be sensitive to the concurrent issues of race that are still facing this nation, and to afford Representative Brown the respect that he deserves. I yield back my time. 
SMITH: I just want to make it clear to everyone that Anthony and I just spoke a second ago, and we're all good. We--we basically believe that everyone in this committee has afforded everyone the respect that they deserve. And I do resent, actually, any implication that it has been otherwise. So, whatever that comment may mean, Anthony and I are good, and I think the whole committee is good. And I--I want to thank everyone in this committee for showing everyone the respect that they deserve during a very difficult process. So, I--I really do appreciate that. 
Who seeks recognition? Mr. Banks. 
BANKS: Chairman, this amendment is unnecessary, it's unwarranted, and it's dangerous. And let's be honest, U.S. military personnel are not commanding, participating in, or accompanying the Saudi led coalition operations against the Houthi insurgents. U.S. operations in Yemen are focused against Al Qaeda and ISIS, both of which continue to pose a clear national security threat to the United States of America. 
We cannot withdraw support for our Saudi partners while they are under attack from Iran-backed Houthi rebels on their southern border. Iranian aggression is a destabilizing force in the region, and we cannot allow Iran to become the dominant power in the Middle East. In fact, DOD support improved the Saudi led coalition processes and procedures, reducing the risk of civilian casualties and collateral damage. 
This amendment would impair DOD's ability to positively influence--influence these activities and would harm DOD's partnerships in the region. The prohibition would apply to all maintenance and spare parts, not just aircraft, and would--and would impact all operations. I hope all of my colleagues will take that seriously and join me in opposing this dangerous amendment. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Bacon? 
BACON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman; appreciate it. I won't go as much detail, because Mr. Banks covered most of what I wanted to say. But I also oppose this amendment. This vote strengthens--or this amendment would strengthen Iran's hand in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula. 
It increases the odds that we'll have an Iranian client state in Yemen on the--on the Arabian Peninsula. It will allow the IRGC to have access to the southern part of the--the peninsula. It's the number one exporter of terror. It's our number one threat in the Middle East. And really, it's a--we would be pulling the rug out from underneath the Saudi--from the Saudis in contending with the threat on their southern border. 
Iran is arming the Houthi rebels, not only with small-arm weapons but also SCUD missiles. They have fired SCUD missiles from Yemen into urban areas of Saudi Arabia. These are Iranian provided. And so, I don't recommend pulling the rug out from our--from the Saudis who are defending their southern border, but also preventing a much larger threat to that area to the United States and our other allies. So, I think this is a--a very bad idea. I think it hurts our national security. It hurts our allies. This--I yield. 
SMITH: Mrs. Stefanik? 
STEFANIK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I join my colleagues in speaking in opposition to this amendment. We do not get to choose the locations where our enemies assemble. The enemy gets a vote. And Al Qaeda and their affiliates, since as far back as the USS Cole attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors in October of 2000, have sought sanctuary in Yemen. They continue to capitalize on the unrest and malign Iranian influence in Yemen and pose a very real threat today to our national security interests. 
This amendment tries to draw an impossible distinction between our relationship and alliances that exist to combat terrorism in the region and those that aim to counter our threats. This amendment will cause irreparable harm to our relationships with our allies and partners. These strategic relationships build trust, which in turn provide critical force protection information that keep our deployed service members safe, make our operations more precise, and ensures American interests are protected in the region. 
And importantly, these relationships counter Iran's destabilizing influence in the region. One thing is clear. This legislation will make our counterterrorism and security efforts in the region less effective and our homeland less safe. Iran certainly supports this amendment. Over the last several years, rebels in Yemen have repeatedly attacked our military forces and allies in the region, including multiple ballistic missile attacks on civilians in Saudi Arabia. They have targeted U.S. Navy ships in the region with sophisticated missiles and launched aerial attacks on civilian oil facilities, threatening to further destabilize the region. 
Any amendment that curtails our ability to confront these threats makes the region less safe, undermines our influence and partnerships, and presents a clear danger to our counterterrorism efforts. I urge my colleagues to vote no. I yield back. 
SMITH: Mr. Waltz? 
WALTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with my colleague Khanna. This war has been horrific in Yemen, but I also think it's worth reminding our colleagues that this war started with a Houthi offensive on the internationally backed Hadi government that has--that has led to this civil war. 
And I think it's--it's--we just have to be clear that it is a false premise to say that, if the U.S. were not involved, that the Saudi's would not be in Yemen and there would not be a war in Yemen. That's--that's just simply a false premise. In fact, it's the opposite, that with U.S. involvement there have been less civilian casualties. There has been more precision, less of a sledgehammer, and--and in fact the U.S. involvement has been a--a mitigating force, and that without it I think the situation would be much worse. 
And one issue in particular with this--with this amendment of no spare parts, no logistics for any member of the coalition, which could be broadly applied to the Saudi's Gulf operations, to the Saudi's operations against Iranian aggression, potential--some future actions potentially in Syria. Look, I have a lot of issues with many actions the Saudi government has taken, but we cannot cut off the entire logistical support from the United States and the Saudi military relationship. 
And--and--and just one final point in my time remaining. My colleague and--and friend from Florida, Mr. Gaetz, talked about the--the possible disconnect of arguing against this amendment but for Mr. Crow's when it comes Afghanistan. I think in fact there is some real consistency. This is about American leadership. It's not perfect, but it is a force for good and it has guaranteed the longest period of global prosperity since World War II. 
And yes, this is not new for the progressive left and the libertarian right to come together on these issues. Just read the history of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt and what he had to deal with for America to lead in World War II with the socialist left and the libertarian right then. So, this is not a new argument. America must lead, and this is just another incidence. And I yield my time. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Bergman? 
BERGMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, you know, the--the level of detailed eloquence in the room on--on--on both sides gives me heart as I talk to my grandchildren, who--the oldest one's just registered for the draft, of the importance of service to our country in all forms and the ability to agree--to disagree. 
This amendment is just--basically it's an--an attempt to tie our hands and limit our, the United States, ability to respond to threats around the world as the world's best coalition partner. We talk a lot about building relationships. Well, to build relationships, a lot of times you have to go to the fight together. And you learn a lot about people and countries and what their backgrounds are. But we are so much better when we persevere through the tough times together. And it's not popular, some of the things you have to do. 
We send a message as the United States that we are absolutely the best--the world's best partner because we will come and help others. And this assistance enables coalition forces to defend themselves, to carry out more precise operations, to get themselves better to protect their own interests. This is unnecessary and it's unwarranted, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. With that, I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. I'll yield to myself in this amendment. Just--we've--we've debated this many times and we've passed it through the House, through the Senate. I think it's been be vetoed at least once by the president or something similar. 
And just a couple observations; first of all, to--to be clear, this amendment does not restrict counterterrorism operations in Yemen. That--that partnership with Saudi Arabia and UAE stays where it--stays where it's at. It focuses on the civil war in Yemen. 
Second, I think it is true that what Saudi Arabia and the UAE have done in the last several years in this conflict has gotten better. It was only a couple years ago that we had the instance of the Saudi Arabians bombing a school bus, bombing a funeral procession, and a large number of civilian casualties in what--what they did. But that was at the time when we had full-scale U.S. participation. And I actually do think that the international pressure that was put on Saudi Arabia most directly, and the UAE to a lesser extent, to say, yeah, whatever we may think about what the Houthis are doing, that is not going to make the situation better. 
And this committee I believe was part of--this Congress was part of it when we passed this and sent it to the president as, you know--and believe me, there are many problems with Saudi Arabia, but historically they have been an ally, and--and certainly the UAE has been. And when they saw that their ally and partner wasn't simply, you know, just signing off on how they were conducting this war, it did lead to a change. 
I was actually in the UAE last year when the UAE signed a peace agreement with all of the southern tribes in Yemen that helped move forward the process. Saudi Arabia right now is engaged in--in a peace process with--with the U.S. envoy, whose name is escaping me right at the moment. So, I believe the pressure that we put on them was part of what you're talking about. And so, it's always a delicate balance, and I completely agree with the malign influence of Iran. 
Right now, that is the biggest thing standing in the way of a peace agreement. Iran doesn't want a peace agreement. But our putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to improve what they're doing and to show that we're not just going to blindly support them while school buses and funeral parties are being bombed, I think did make--make a difference. I've supported this amendment in the past. I'll support it now for those same--same reasons. 
Does anyone else seek--Mr. Gaetz? 
GAETZ: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Many of my Republican colleagues speaking in opposition to this amendment have referenced the need to counter al--al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula. I strongly agree with that sentiment, being that it was AQAP that inspired the murder my constituents in Pensacola. It is also why I can support this amendment, because lines 7 through 10 of the amendment permit any and all activities that we would engage in against AQAP. So, it seems like a bit misplaced debate. 
There was a lot of conversation from my colleagues about the need for us to be obligated to secure Saudi Arabia's southern border. I--I wish we had that much passion and interest in securing our own southern border. To me, that would--that would seemingly be a more consistent application of our principles. 
And it--and it seems odd to bang our chests about American leadership while referencing Afghanistan and Yemen. If what we get for--from American leadership is involvement in one of the most brutal, horrific civil wars in Yemen and then a multi-decade war in Afghanistan, one asks the question if that leadership is being properly husbanded for the benefit of our country. There is an opportunity for the president, under any circumstance, to respond to terrorism, to threats against our forces, as my Republican colleagues have referenced, attacks against our interests and against our allies. We would still have the ability, under the language of the amendment, to fully respond to those things. 
But what we do not need is excessive entanglement from the United States in some civil war where we're trying to build some democracy out of sand and blood. And that is what we have done for far too long in the Middle East. We--we have--we have done great work in this legislation to raise our gaze to combat the real threat that we face, which is China. And continuing to obsess about our--our Middle Eastern conquests just does not rise to the level of a--of a great body or a great nation. I--I thank the chairman. I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. All those in favor of the amendment will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: All those opposed will say no. 
UNKNOWN: No. 
SMITH: In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. 
All right. We are now shifting over--I'm sorry. A recorded vote is requested so further discussion of the amendment will be suspended. It will be added to the list of recorded votes. 
We're moving now on to an en bloc package, which I will get to in just one second. We will now consider en bloc package number two. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number two, consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. Without objection, so ordered. Will the clerk please distribute en bloc amendment number two? 
Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. And I wish that statement was completely true. This is, I believe, the longest list yet, so bear with me. I wish I could do some sort of interpretive thing here and make this more interesting for all of us, but I cannot. I will--I will read them. 
En bloc package number two consists of Log 56 by Representative Conaway, Log 111r1 by Representative Gal--Gallego, Log 635r1 by Representative Cheney, Log 291 by Representative Speier, Log 494r1 by Representative Brown, Log 535r1 by Representative Thornberry, Log 36 by Representative Conaway, Log 434r1 by Representative Keating, Log 475r1 by Representative Stefanik, Log 339r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 326r1 by Representative Banks, Log 651 by Representative Cooper, Log 639r1 by Representative Thornberry, Log 645 by Representative Keating, Log 249r2 by Representative Houlahan, Log--Log 566r2 by Representative Langevin, Log 637r2 by Representative Torres Small, Log 201r1 by Representative Larsen, Log 408r2 by Representative Langevin, Log 597r4 by Representative Speier, Log 388 by Representative Langevin, Log 640r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 399r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 24--Log 24r2 by Representative Langevin, Log 490r3 by Representative Torres Small, Log 282r3 by Representative Brown, Log 615r1 by Representative Bacon, Log 215 by Representative Crow, Log 293r3 by Representative Kim, Log 128r1 by Representative Turner, Log 28r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 17 by Representative Gallagher, Log 62r2 by Representative Stefanik, Log 387r2 by Representative Cisneros, Log 176r2 by Representative Waltz, Log 206r3 by Representative Larsen, Log 315 by Representative Garamendi, Log 571r5 by Representative Torres Small, Log 310r1 by Representative Speier, Log 527r1 by Representative Sherrill, Log 544r1 by Representative Keating, Log 94R1 by Representative Gallagher, Log 644 by Representative Thornberry, Log 316 by Representative Banks, Log 138r1 by Representative Gabbard, Log 634 by Representative Sherrill, Log 295r3 by Representative Luria, Log 254r1 by Representative Carbajal, Log 222r1 by Representative Crow, Log 124r1 by Representative Garamendi, Log 632r1 by Representative Keating, Log 184r2 by Representative Slotkin, Log 161r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 191r1 by Representative Brooks, Log 568r1 by Representative Carbajal, Log 591r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 511 by Representative Conaway, Log 509r4 by Representative Brown, Log 612r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 539r2 by Representative Haaland, Log 33r2 by Representative Davis, Log 347r3 by Representative Banks, Log 12r1 by Representative Slotkin, Log 502r2 by Representative Trahan, Log 614r2 by Representative Gaetz, Log 86 by Representative Turner, Log 389r1 by Representative Cooper, Log 316r2 by Representative Banks, Log 43 by Representative Luria, Log 378 by Representative Houlahan, Log 625 by Representative Rogers, Log 321r1 by Representative Hartzler, Log 413r1 by Representative Garamendi, Log 638 by Representative Garamendi, Log 210 by Representative Larsen, Log 217 by Representative Speier, Log 370 by Representative Waltz, Log 524r-5--524r3 by Representative Sherrill, Log 630r1 by Representative Brindisi, Log 355r2 by Representative Banks, Log 155r1 by Representative Norcross, Log 469r1 by Representative Garamendi, Log 363r2 by Representative Banks, Log 401r1 by Representative Torres Small, Log 30r1 by Representative Rogers, Log 200 by Representative Kelly, Log 482r2 by Representative DesJarlais, Log 470r1 by Representative Bishop, Log 617r1 by Representative Langevin, Log 560r2 by Representative Lamborn, Log 237r1 by Representative Speier, Log 274r3 by Representative Cheney. 
Is there any discussion of en bloc number two? 
LANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: Sorry. 
LANGEVIN: Mr. Chairman? 
SMITH: Oh. Mr. Langevin? 
LANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this en bloc package contains four amendments I--I offer with Mr. Gallagher that are based on our work on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. Before I go through them quickly, I have to acknowledge the work, first of all, of Josh Stiefel on the ITC staff, as well as Nick Leiserson, my--my LD. 
There are over 50 legislative proposals in the Solarium Commission Report, and both Josh and Nick have worked tirelessly for months to turn these policy ideas into law. They are both a credit to this august committee and the legislative process, and I certainly hope we can take a moment to thank them both for their contributions to keeping our country safe in cyberspace. 
Mr. Chairman, as you know, I've been working on cyber security policy now for more than a dozen years, and I've been a member of this committee now for nearly 20 years. In that time, there is no activity that I've enjoyed more that has better reflected the true power of our institutions to make a deliberative nonpartisan policy than being part of the commission. Under the leadership of our co-chairs, Congressman Gallagher and Senator King, our report puts forth a clear strategic direction for our country, that of layered cyber deterrence. And thanks in no small part to your leadership, Mr. Chairman, this year's NDAA is going to go a long way to implementing that strategy. 
This amendment package--package addresses four critical recommendations in the report. The Solarium Commission has recognized that our technological prowess fuels our military power, that our innovative defense industrial base is why we are able to aim never to send our troops into a fair fight. But our adversaries recognize this as well, and regularly target defense companies to steal their intellectual property and compromise our tactical edge. 
So our amendment implementing Solarium Commission recommendation 6.1.1 will better protect the defense industrial base by requiring participation in three--in free threat intelligence sharing programs, so that defense contractors have a clear understanding of adversary tactics, techniques, procedures and the indicators of compromise. By acting on recommendation 6.1.2, we will move to a much more proactive posture on DIB networks hunting threat actors before they have the chance to exfiltrate data or disrupt key processes. 
This amendment dovetails with the framework created under the cybersecurity maturity models certification program, where CMMC looks at key indicators of risk on DIB networks. Threat hunting will allow us to root out the pernicious advance persistent threats that pose the greatest challenges to our defense contractor community. 
The other two amendments deal with strengthening interagency defense operations and improving operational collaboration with the private sector. By creating a joint collaborative environment as called for in recommendation 5.2, we will make use of the cyber threat indicators being shared among federal agencies-- 
SMITH: I do apologize. The gentleman's time has expired. I don't know if--well, I'll yield you an additional two minutes from my time. Go ahead. 
LANGEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll wrap up, hopefully--certainly within the two minutes. So 5.2, we'll make use of the threat indicators being shared among federal agencies and the private sector by allowing true collaborative analysis on a common platform with a common toolset, where critical infrastructure operators can work side-by-side with interagency teams. 
The JCE is really the brainchild of another of our commissioners, Tom Fanning. And I want to thank Tom for his immense commitment to public service and devotion to protecting the country from cyberattack, even as he runs one of the largest power companies in the country. 
Finally, we implement recommendation 5.3 by requiring a thorough review of the integrated cyber center at CISA. It is my sincere hope that we will finally realize the potential of a national center to guide whole-of-nation cyber defense operations, such as the defense of our elections. 
These are four meaningful recommendations that will significantly enhance our nation's cyber security posture. I'm proud to offer them alongside the newest father on the committee, Mr. Gallagher. I know he is taking well-deserved paternity leave at the moment and in his honor, though it pains me to say it, I will mention the obligatory Go Packers, because it's not nearly as painful as saying Go Buccaneers. But be that as it may, I look forward to continue to work with you, Mr. Chairman, and all of our colleagues to enact these solarium recommendations into law. 
With that, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the extra time and courtesy. 
SMITH: Thank you. Ms. Torres Small. 
TORRES SMALL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak quickly on the sense of Congress that I have in this en bloc. I deeply appreciate the committee, as well as the ENC And Natural Resources Committee for working to get it into today's bill. This sense of Congress is also included in the Senate NDAA, and it's about beating back Russia's effort to control and manipulate our energy market, and force regional submission in Europe. 
As many of you know, Russians are currently limited by statute and trade agreement to 20 percent of the U.S. market for enriched uranium. That makes sense. Russians can undercut market prices because their nuclear fuel complex is state-owned and heavily subsidized by the Russian government. For them it's about power, not about competition. But those limits are about to expire at the end of this year, and the Russians are already signing contracts to at least double their share of the U.S. market. 
However, I want to be clear that this sense of Congress is just the starting point on this issue. More action is needed before the end of this year to ensure we can stop Russia from taking a dominant position in the United States energy market. 
I also urge you to support the stand-alone bill I have with Representative Bishop to extend the caps, H.R. 7151. I'm working to get this legislation adopted in the coming months. Together as Americans, we must find a way to get this issue resolved before the caps expire. I yield the remainder of my time. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Kelly. 
KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will try to be brief, also. I want to thank you for yielding. And I speak in support of Log 200, hazardous duty pay. The idea was given to me by Mr. Richard Hudson of North Carolina. And the bill language increases hazardous duty pay from $250 a month to $275. 
We ask our war fighters to deploy in harm's way, and this minimal increase is just a step in the right direction to show them that we support them as they fight in defense of this nation and our allies, while separated from their families. 
Mr. Hudson would also like to expand the situation where this pay applies, and I'm committed to expanding this in next year's NDAA to include hazardous duty environments where our servicemembers, especially those in our special operations community operate in harm's way. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I thank you and I yield back. 
SMITH: Thank you. Mr. Carbajal. 
CARBAJAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to speak in support of my amendment included in this en bloc package number 254. Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry, I want to thank both of you and your staff for working with me to find a path forward to support ongoing negotiations that allow for the advancement of renewable energy, in a manner that is compatible with the training and readiness requirements of the Department of Defense. 
Wind energy is both critical for meeting our 21st century clean energy goals and create thousands of new jobs. As some of you may know, there is great promise for the development of offshore wind energy in my district off the Central Coast of California, especially in light of the expected closure of the Diablo Canyon powerplant. 
Since 2016, federal, state, and local stakeholders, including the Department of Defense, have participated in negotiations to allow for wind energy development off the Central Coast, while also ensuring the Department of Defense is able to continue meeting its test--meaning its testing, training, and operational requirements. 
In 2019, I helped convene an offshore wind working group, which has made great progress in finding a win-win solution. Progress was made with the Navy agreeing to move forward with a proposal that is currently out for public comment. Unfortunately, a newly confirmed Assistant Secretary of the Navy made it clear to myself and HASC that any wind energy development may not be compatible with military activities. This reversal came abruptly, without additional analysis or acknowledgement of commitments previously made. 
My amendment will protect the established clearinghouse process and continue to build upon the progress the working group has made by preventing the Department of Defense from prematurely objecting to an offshore energy project on the Central Coast of California, and require DOD to brief HASC on the status of the working group negotiations. I am confident that we can work together to advance energy security and military readiness. 
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
SMITH: Is there any further discussion on en bloc package number two? Hearing none, the question is on adoption of en bloc package number two. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Opposed, no. Ayes have it. The amendment is adopted. 
And it is now in order to consider en bloc package number three. It is shorter than en bloc package number two was. I ask unanimous consent to call up en bloc package number three, consisting of amendments that have been worked and approved with the minority. Without objection, so ordered. 
Will the clerk please distribute the en bloc amendments? Without objection, the amendments are considered as read. 
En bloc package number three is comprised of the following: Log 193 by Representative Kelly, Log 522r1 by Representative Kim, Log 536r1 by Representative Thornberry, Log 14r1 by Representative Bacon, Log 125r1 by Representative Garamendi, Log 636 by Representative Thornberry, Log 192r1 by Representative Brooks, Log 58 by Representative Norcross, Log 106r1 by Representative Brown, Log 61 by Representative Norcross, Log 69r1 by Representative Norcross, Log 5r1 by Representative Slotkin, Log 542r1 by Representative Kelly, Log 445r1 by Representative Wilson, Log 455r1 by Representative Luria, Log 141 by Representative Gabbard, Log 350r2 by Representative Banks, Log 303r1 by Representative Larsen, Log 456 by Representative Golden, Log 649r1 by Representative Escobar, Log 462r3 by Representative Crow. 
Is there discussion on en bloc package number three? If there is no discussion, the question occurs on en bloc package--oh, I'm sorry. Where are we at? 
BROWN: (INAUDIBLE) 
SMITH: Yes. Yeah, sorry, I apologize. Mr. Brown. 
BROWN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (INAUDIBLE) 
SMITH: I don't think your mic is-- 
BROWN: (INAUDIBLE) 
SMITH: Well, we'll take care of you. Don't worry about it. Go ahead. 
BROWN: All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a pivotal time for our armed services. While the military prides itself on leading, on integration and making strides in advance--to advance men and women of color, we have fallen far short of our expectations. Today, we're still grappling with a military that doesn't fully reflect our country's diversity. 
The same biases and inequities that follow a black person in our neighborhoods and communities sadly exists in our military, impacting how a black soldier advances, what field she specialize in, how he is treated. Just this month, we've seen historic firsts in the progress our armed services are making towards greater diversity and inclusion. 
The first black service chief in U.S. Army history, General Brown of the Air Force. Chief Master Sergeant JoAnne Bass selected as the first woman to serve as the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer in a military branch. And next month, the U.S. Army will welcome its first female Green Beret. 
All of that is fantastic, but it's not enough. 43 percent of the 1.3 million active duty are people of color. Yet of the 41 four-star generals and admirals, there's only two black generals and one woman; this which is a full decade after the bipartisan Military Leadership Diversity Commission made many recommendations to address this lack of diversity inclusion. 
Yet today, only 1.7 percent of all fighter pilots or navigators are black, and only 2 percent are women. Only 5 percent of Green Berets, 2 percent of Seals, and less than 1 percent of the Air Force pararescue jumpers are black. 
Additionally, Mr. Chairman, we need to confront the growing threat of white supremacy, racism, extremism, and anti-Semitism within our ranks. According to a Military Times poll, 53 percent of minority servicemembers said they had seen examples of white nationalism and racism among their fellow troops. We must say in one voice that these beliefs will not be tolerated. 
More must be done to protect our troops from heinous crimes. We need to continue our work to protect soldiers from sexual harassment, assault, and provide survivors recourse. We need to do more to protect soldiers against hate crimes and other racially motivated attacks. We need to examine the safety of our military installations and understand that failures that may have contributed to the disappearance of Private First Class--Mr. Speaker--Mr. Chairman, my written remarks just went blank on me, so I'm just going to have to improvise here. 
Look, let me just wrap up by saying we should be really proud of what we have done today. This 2021 NDAA markup coming out of this committee is probably the boldest and the biggest strides that we have taken to ensure diversity inclusion, justice and fairness in our military, both in promotions and assignments and treatment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
This is an organization that led our country in integration, yet it can do better. And what we did this evening, and what we'll do on the floor and in conference, will give commanders the tools, the department the tools, that they need to make sure that every soldier has an opportunity to be their very best, to contribute the most that they can contribute, that will contribute to the readiness of our force. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
SMITH: Thank you, Anthony, I appreciate that. And I do really want to emphasize exactly what Mr. Brown just said. The work that goes into this bill on dealing with the issues of equality is substantial. And the overwhelming majority of it was worked out by members and staff added to the bill. We do not debate the specific amendments, but we are committed to improving the diversity and improving the equality within the military. 
And I think as with all society, we have to admit that we have a long way to go. When you look at some of the numbers that Mr. Brown just talked about, in terms of promotions, there is concerns about how the UCMJ is implemented. At a minimum, we need to take a look at it and understand that equality is the goal, the objective, and we are going to keep working until we achieve that equality of treatment for people. We've got a lot of work to do, but I think we've made a good--good step in this bill. 
Does anybody else seek recognition on this en bloc amendment? Seeing none, the question is on adoption of en bloc package number three. All those in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Aye. Those opposed will say no. Ayes have it. En bloc package number three is adopted. 
It is now in order to proceed to vote on those amendments where a rollcall vote was ordered. We have 10 of those, for those of you keeping score at home. They will appear on the handy-dandy little chart over there. And before we vote on each one, I will identify it by more than just a number, so that you can remember at this point. 
The first vote that we have--do I really have to read the log number? I do, okay. The committee postponed further proceedings on amendments to Log number 453r1 by Mr. Gallego, and shall now resume those proceedings. This was the amendment about placing some restrictions on moving troops in Germany. I am not attempting to clearly articulate everything in the amendment. I'm just trying to prompt your memory. So that's what it was. 
And the question occurs now on that amendment, and the clerk will call the roll.

SMITH: The amendment is agreed to. We will now consider the last amendment that we have, which is log number 641, which I recognize myself, I will be offering it. Will the court please distribute the amendment? Without objection, we will dispense with the reading and the amendment, and I recognize myself to explain the amendment. We--we have nine members of our committee who are retiring off the committee. This will be their--their last year, and I wanted to be sure, and--and recognize all of them, and recognize their--their service to this committee. Starting on our side we have, you know, Susan Davis, second-most senior member on the Democratic side, who has been here for 22 years now-- 
DAVIS: --Twenty-- 
SMITH: --Twenty. And has chaired committees, has been a ranking member on committees, and has worked on more issues than I could possibly name, and I really appreciate her service. Also Tulsi Gabbard is retiring as well off of our committee. In addition to serving on the committee, she serves as a Civil Affairs Officer in the Army Reserves, and I think that--that perspective is enormously helpful. I think we have a number of members who serve in a variety of capacities. I think it's been very helpful; we really appreciate her service. 
And we have a number of Republicans retiring as well, Mr. Bishop, of Utah. I've always enjoyed work--working with you, appreciate the relationship, the issues we've been able to push through, through the years, and I appreciate your leadership on a large number of issues. Mr. Conaway as well, I remember our service together on the--well, I think we called it the Emerging Threats--or, sorry, I can't remember what we called it back then, the Emerging Threats Subcommittee and intermittent traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, amongst other places, appreciate your leadership. Paul Cook, really appreciate your leadership as well. And I will reemphasize the fact that whatever you may have done in the military with the people's money, I'm sure you did a good job with it, and you will not be going to hell. 
(LAUGHTER) 
At least not for that. I can't--I can't speak to anything else. And Bradley Byrne, really appreciate your leadership, the legal perspective, enormously helpful, appreciate working with you. Ralph Abraham, also retiring, appreciate your perspective with your background as well. It contributed greatly to the committee. And Paul Mitchell, also retiring, appreciate the--the robust debate today and always. You've always been a gentleman in the way you've approached issues, and I very much appreciate that. 
And of course you will note that I did leave one out, and that is the ranking member, Miss-Mr. Thornberry, who will be retiring this year. And I've had the opportunity to say this many times, so I think it's really important to say it here, Mac is just an incredible representative for his district, and--and for this committee. I was getting notes from a variety of people and Dem leadership to see how we're doing tonight, and the last note that I got was asking me, you know, how it was going. And I said it's great, and it's like--and they're like, wow, a bipartisan process., that really doesn't happen around here anymore. But it happens here, and it happens here, I think, because of the tradition of the leadership of the committee. 
When I first got elected to Congress, believe it or not, Floyd Spence was the chairman, and--and Ron Dellums was the ranking member. It's hard to imagine two--two members from--from different--more different constituencies. But they very much adhered to the--the bipartisan, we work together, we get this done, it's important tradition. And every leader along the way is responsible for maintaining that, and every leader has. And Mac has exemplified that, as a chairman and as a ranking member. He has worked with us to get this process done, but more than that he has an incredible understanding of how the Pentagon and DOD works. 
It is a very difficult, if not impossible bureaucracy to wrestle to the ground, but there is nobody better at understanding it and working those issues than Mac, and also nobody, I believe, any more committed to the men and women who serve in the military. That has always been his priority in what we do here, and that leadership has reflected very well on this committee and on all of us, and he--he will be missed. And I--I hope we will follow his example going forward of how to lead this committee, and how to work together to get things done. 
I would also be remiss if I didn't recognize his wife Sally, and thank her as well. As we all know, the families are a huge part of getting this done, and without her support there's no way Mac would've been able to do what he has done in this committee. So, I--I thank both of them for that. And then last--the last amendment we have here--and I apologize, I don't have the official name here. But the bottom line is, we--we are naming the bill this year after Mr. Thornberry, in recognition of your service. 
(APPLAUSE) 
And--and with that, I will very unfairly yield to Mr. Thornberry for any comment he may--may have on this amendment. 
THORNBERRY: Number one, Mr. Chairman, I object. 
(LAUGHTER) 
Thank--thank you very much for your kind words. And I'll just say this, I--I appreciate the opportunity over the years to work with all the members, and I want to point out especially the members who are--are retiring this year. There's a lot about this job I'm not going to miss, to tell you the truth. But I will miss the chance to work with members of this committee not knowing who's a Republican or a Democrat, traveling around the world, meeting with troops, listening to them, trying to listen, learn, and solve problems to make this country more secure. I'll miss that. But it's because of the chance to work with you, and--and all of the members who have served on this committee for the last 26 years. So, I appreciate that opportunity. 
Lastly, I'd just point out, when I got done before midnight, I got a case of beer. I don't know what you're going to get, but you've done--but this--this has been a challenging circumstance, again. You've once again done a very good job of managing this committee, and I appreciate it. 
SMITH: Well--well thank you, I appreciate that. 
(APPLAUSE) 
And as you know better than anyone, I'm not as good a negotiator as you are, so I didn't--I didn't cut that deal, I should've thought of it fast. I will say that my--my staff did get me a bottle of scotch when we finally passed last year--last year's bill through the whole process, which was very much appreciated. And want to just add note to that, just to really agree, the best thing about this job. is the people you get to meet, and get to work with, all across the country, all different backgrounds. It is, you know, an experience that is--that is unmatched, and I very much appreciate that. And with that, all those in favor of the amendment will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed. The amendment--the amendment is adopted. And now, I have more reading to do. If there are no further amendments, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Brown, for the purposes of offering a motion. 
BROWN: Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt the chairman's mark as amended. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion of the gentlemen from Maryland, so many as in favor will--and I want to emphasize here that we are adopting at this point the--the chairman's--sorry, the full committee mark, not the entire bill. This is the last little piece of it which we put into, and then we'll have a vote on the full bill in just a second. So many as are in favor will say aye. 
UNKNOWN: Aye. 
SMITH: Those opposed. Quorum being present, the ayes have it, and the motion is adopted. Alright. We will now vote on reporting the bill favorably to the House. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Brown, for the purposes of a motion. 
BROWN: Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee report the bill H.R. 6395 as amended, favorably to the House with a recommendation that it do pass. 
SMITH: The question is on the motion of the gentleman from Maryland, and the--this requires a recorded vote, so the Clerk will call the roll.

(APPLAUSE) 
SMITH: Thank you all. Good job, all. A quorum being present, the motion is adopted. Without objection, the motion to be considered is laid upon the table, for the purposes for this gentleman from Texas to seek recognition. 
THORNBERRY: Mr. Chairman, consistent with House rules, I'd like to assert the right of any member to file supplementary--supplemental minority, additional, or dissenting views for inclusion in the committee's report to the House on the bill just ordered reported. 
SMITH: Pursuant to clause 2(L) of House Rule XI, the members are entitled to not less than two calendar days to file such views in writing. I ask unanimous consent that staff be authorized to make necessary conformant tactical and clerical changes and to remove from the bill as amended provisions that would cause the bill to be referred to other committees, or would result in additional direct spending, or that would result in an earmark. 
Without objection and so ordered, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to make such motions on the floor as are necessary to go to conference with the Senate on bill H.R. 6395 or a similar Senate measure. Without objection and so ordered, if there--well, one final thing, if I could just get everyone's attention for one quick second. I--I did it at the beginning, and I sort of did it in the middle, but it needs to be done at the end. The staff did a phenomenal job from the beginning to the end of this conference. 
(APPLAUSE) 
As--as I pointed out to Paul, just quickly a minute ago, we--I may--we have to read all those--they--they have to read the entire amendment, sort through it, make sense of it, get to the consensus that we all pass, and they did an unbelievable job this year. I am forever in their debt. And with that, if there are no further business, the committee stands adjourned subject to the call of the chair. "
