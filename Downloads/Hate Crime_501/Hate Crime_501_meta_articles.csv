The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday on the Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, also known as the CAREN legislation. It's a nod to a popular meme using the name ""Karen"" to describe an entitled white woman whose actions stem from her privilege, such as using police to target people of color.
All 11 supervisors signed on to the legislation, guaranteeing its passage, despite criticism that the name is sexist and divisive. It comes amid a national reckoning on race sparked by the police killings of Black Americans and instances where white people called for officers to investigate people of color.
""We don't want what happened to Emmett Till in 1955, or the long history of false accusations of Black men and boys in this country, due to weaponizing law enforcement, to threaten, terrorize, and sometimes even kill them, to ever happen again,"" said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who introduced the legislation and is Black.
""I really want to emphasize that 911 is not a customer service line for someone's racist behavior,"" he said.
Walton was the only supervisor to speak. Till was a Black teenager beaten to death in 1955 after accusations by a white woman who later admitted lying.
In May, Amy Cooper, a white woman, called 911 from Manhattan's Central Park, falsely claiming that a Black man - who had politely asked her to leash her dog - was threatening her. She has been charged with filing a false police report.
In San Francisco, a white couple was criticized on social media after video was widely shared of them questioning a Filipino American stenciling ""Black Lives Matter"" on a retaining wall in front of his home in June. They later called police.
James Juanillo said he chose yellow chalk to match the color of the house. When the couple approached him, they repeatedly demanded to know whether it was his home because he was defacing private property.
""They tried to cast it as a criminal scene,"" he said. ""It was me calmly applying chalk, not spray paint, not in the middle of the night but very deliberately. The only thing that was missing was a pinot grigio.""
Supporters of the legislation say it is crushing to be confronted by police because someone saw you as a threat, possibly as a criminal or as not belonging. It's especially terrifying for Black people, whose encounters with police could end in violence.
""This is not hyperbole,"" said Brittni Chicuata, chief of staff for San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. ""This is an established pattern reflected in the disparate treatment of Black people and other people of color in our city and in our country.""
Other places have moved to make placing racist 911 calls a hate crime. California's governor recently signed a measure making the crime a misdemeanor punishable by jail time and a fine. New York approved legislation allowing the victims of racist 911 calls to sue.
The San Francisco legislation gives people the right to sue a 911 caller in civil court, and supporters hope it will make some think twice before turning to police. The discrimination need not be only racial; it can also be due to the person's sex, age, religion, disability, gender identity, weight or height.
The legislation does not spell out the standards needed to sue. But it notes that qualifying calls are those that caused the person to feel harassed or embarrassed; damaged the person's reputation or business prospects; or forced the person from an area where they had a lawful right to be.
The board has received written complaints from eight people - several whose names have different spellings of Karen - saying they support the legislation but object to its moniker, which they call sexist and ageist. "

7,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-08-31,"2129 words",NA,"Rong Xiaoqing",NA,"This Year Could Be a Reckoning for New York's Chinese Community",FALSE,"Aug 31, 2020( Foreign Policy: http://www.foreignpolicy.com/ Delivered by Newstex) The morning before Independence Day, the Chinese-dominated neighborhood of Flushing in New York City was boiling over. Close to 200 people, all Chinese, waving American flags and holding signs, gathered in front of the library in the Queens district and chanted, 'We love the NYPD,' and 'All lives matter.' Their voices could be heard a few blocks away. Beside the crowd, a few dozen people, mainly in their 20s and including many Asians, held their own signs: 'Black Lives Matter,' 'Defund Racism.' 
They were outnumbered, but they still made plenty of noise, chanting at the larger group in their own persistent rhythm: 'We don't love the NYPD. But we love you.' Sometimes they chanted in Mandarin, with detectably nonnative accents. A middle-aged man who wanted to be identified only by his last name, Wang, came across from the larger group to challenge some of the young people helping distribute anti-police-brutality fliers. 'I've been in the U.S. for 30 years. I did all odd jobs. I work hard,' Wang said, waving his arms. 'Black lives matter. Does my life matter too?' A few gray-haired Chinese joined him. 'If you don't like American police, move to a country with no American police,' one shouted at the young people. 'I don't know why they are so angry,' Fiona Zhao, a 26-year-old New York-born Chinese woman, told me. In her hand, a sign in Chinese said, 'Same harm, same racism, same history. United against police brutality.' Her sign highlights the long-standing concept that people of color may have some united interests. Despite having been upheld by the pioneers of the civil rights movement for decades, the idea is now challenged by a rising movement of conservative Chinese, many of whom are relatively new immigrants to the United States from mainland China. In particular, this increasingly vocal group vehemently opposes affirmative action in college admissions, as they believe it shortchanges the interests of Asian students and favors Black and Hispanic students. They have also taken law-and-order stances against the legalization of marijuana and reforms of the bail system. Their separation from the liberal mainstream has become even starker in the wake of the anti-police-brutality movement triggered by the death of George Floyd in May. While many Americans of all races and backgrounds have protested on the streets to demand reforms, including defunding the police, some new Chinese immigrants have joined the other side, led by white conservatives, to show their support for the police. They participated in almost all the pro-police rallies in New York this summer, whether organized by resident groups that support President Donald Trump or entities like the Brooklyn Conservative Party. Sometimes, they were the only organized minority group at white-majority rallies, for example, at the march that took place on June 22 in Middle Village, Queens. That might seem surprising, but it makes sense given this group's history in the United States. Public safety has always been a top concern in the Chinese community in the United States. In 2013, during the New York mayoral election, many Chinese voters made their choice based on the candidates' stance on the city's stop-and-frisk policy. Many voted against those who supported rescinding the enforcement practice that mostly targeted the Black and Hispanic communities. Even John Liu, then city comptroller and a political rock star in the Chinese community, failed to secure an endorsement from at least one Chinese-language newspaper, largely because of his call for tossing out the stop-and-frisk program. There is a real fear that the COVID-19 pandemic and reforms to the justice system could lead to rising crime. Racist attacks against Asians over the origins of the virus in China and the looting of shops in Chinatowns in several cities have reinforced their stance. 'Without the police, who's going to protect us?' said Donghui Zang, a father of two who has attended several rallies in support of the police. Zang, who is also the head of the New York City Residents Alliance, a grassroots organization of Chinese immigrant parents, has been organizing Chinese residents in his neighborhood in Forest Hills, Queens, to donate masks and pizza lunches to the local police precinct since the pandemic hit the United States in March. And he also formed a vigilante patrol that drives through the neighborhood at night periodically to 'deter' troublemakers. 'This is a time you don't want to reduce the power of the police. You want to enhance it,' Zang said. The rise of attitudes like Zang's also reflects the complex relationship the Chinese community has with the Black community. Chinese and Black community leaders consistently backed each other during the civil rights movement. Grace Lee Boggs, a Chinese American activist who married the Black activist James Boggs in the 1950s, fought for equal rights for Black people for much of her life before she died in 2015 at the age of 100. And the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson stood with Asian protesters to fight for justice in the 1980s, after a young Chinese man, Vincent Chin, was killed by two white auto factory workers in Detroit. They thought Chin was Japanese and held him responsible for the threat to their jobs from Japanese automakers. But tensions between Chinese shopkeepers and customers in Black neighborhoods have also simmered for a long time. In the 19th century, Chinese immigrants settled in the Mississippi Delta region, where many among the community opened grocery stores, profiting from the freed slaves whose access to the broader economy was still systematically restricted. More recently, the stage has been set for more suspicion between the two communities as more Chinese immigrants seeking new markets after Chinatowns became saturated opened up in Black neighborhoods. They sometimes faced resentment from relatively poorer Black locals who felt that the shopkeepers were becoming rich off the struggling local communities. After a spate of murders[1] of Chinese deliverymen in historically Black New York neighborhoods, Chinese business leaders came more directly into confrontation with local communities and began demanding police support. 'I understand the police may abuse their power sometimes. But that doesn't mean we should defund the police,' said John Chan, the president of Asian American Community Empowerment, an organization created to aid families of killed deliverymen. 'Without the police, who's going to help us when we are targeted by criminals?' Chinese support for the police hit a milestone in February 2016, when tens of thousands walked the street in 40 cities in the United States to call for justice for Peter Liang, a rookie New York Police Department cop who was convicted of manslaughter after accidentally shooting dead a Black man, Akai Gurley, in the dark stairwell of a government housing project while on patrol in November 2014.In the view of the Chinese protesters, Liang was a scapegoat—after all, a series of white police officers had avoided prosecution after their violent conduct led to the deaths of Black civilians. The protesters felt he was an easy target for prosecution because he was Chinese.That was not the view of Black Lives Matter activists, who saw Liang as a part of the police apparatus, regardless of his ethnic background. A month after Liang killed Gurley, in late December 2014, New York police officer Wenjian Liu and his partner Rafael Ramos were shot dead in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, who had picked the cops randomly in revenge for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, both Black men who had died during police operations against them. Liu was treated as a hero in the Chinese community. 'As immigrants ourselves, we rely on the police to help us on all sorts of things. They have sacrificed so much for our safety,' Vivian Shen, a 70-year-old immigrant from Shanghai, told me in July. Shen was a colleague of Liu's wife, Pei Xia Chen, at the time he was killed. Shen, who has lived in New York since 1986, said that she has had scores of interactions with police. When she was lost driving back home from Long Island, a police officer helped her find her way. When her father with Alzheimer's strayed away from home, it was the police who found him and sent him back. When 9/11 happened, her husband, who worked in the twin towers, was rescued by a police officer. When New York City recently decided to cut $1 billion from the budget of the police department, Shen raised $1,400 from 14 of her family members and friends for the police. (The donation was accepted by the 109th Precinct Community Council, a nonprofit that builds communications between the precinct and the local community.) 'I am an ordinary senior. I am not able to do much. But I want to help the police in whichever way I can,' Shen said. Of course, the relationship between the police and the Chinese immigrant community is much more complicated than Shen's particular experience may suggest. The memory of Yong Xin Huang, a 16-year-old shot dead in 1995 by a police officer who thought the BB gun Huang was playing with was a deadly weapon, still sends shudders through some people in the community. The police officer who was responsible for his death was not charged. Another flash point came in July, when a nearly 90-year-old Chinese woman went to the police after her shirt was set on fire by a pair of strangers. There, she was told to go back home to call 911. This outraged some people in the community, including the hip-hop artist China Mac, who organized protests demanding the case be categorized as a hate crime. And many Chinese street vendors have been ticketed or arrested by the police for reasons beyond their comprehension. 'By the end of the month, you've got to be very careful. That's when the police would try to fulfil their quota of tickets, and we'd get tickets for no reason,' Shaohua Yu, a street vendor in Manhattan's Chinatown, told me. (The NYPD has denied it has a quota for tickets.) Yet many new Chinese immigrants tend to seek solutions within the system rather than trying to work outside it. Yu said that even when he believes he has been ticketed unfairly, he still accepts the situation without resistance. 'I can always get it dismissed in court,' he said. Zang and Shen say they deal with their driving tickets in the same way. To many Chinese immigrants, the Black Lives Matter protests and the calls to defund the police appear to be too radical. While such civil rights protests and demands are an ingrained part of the American democratic system, to people who grew up under the iron fist of the Chinese Communist Party they go well beyond challenging the system. Many still remember how the Tiananmen protests in 1989 became too much for China's political leadership and were viciously crushed as a result. In turn, they often have a narrower conception of working within the system for change. Such acceptance of authority—even when it is entirely wrong—poses a tough challenge to the liberals in the Chinese community who offer the message that Chinese interests are tied to those of Black people.'Many Chinese immigrants have never faced this kind of police violence in China. When they see it here, they don't necessarily know how to react to it. Their gut reaction is not to oppose the government,' John Liu, the former comptroller who now serves as a New York state senator, told me in a phone interview in July. 'When people say we support the police, they are really saying we are not against the government.' Liu noted that not all Chinese residents who support the police are against Black Lives Matter. Many may be out at the rallies to show their appreciation for individual police officers they know, he said. Still, he wants new Chinese immigrants to learn more about the history of the civil rights movement in the United States. 'Black people do not trust the system because the system failed them every single time,' Liu said. Chinese people wouldn't have as much privilege, he argued, 'or even the ability to immigrate here without the civil rights movement, without the ongoing struggles of Black people.' Although it doesn't seem some of the participants in the Flushing rally could be persuaded to accept this view anytime soon, Liu is hopeful. 'Many of the Asians who are in the BLM movement are young, so are the vast majority of the protesters. This is a generational shift in this country,' Liu said. 'Over time, it's their kids who are going to educate them.' [ 1]: https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/nyregion/deliverymans-murder-case-is-focus-of-chinese-press.html "

HALA GORANI, CNN HOST, CONNECT THE WORLD: Hello everyone, I'm Hala Gorani. Coming up this hour, 26 U.S. states are reporting increases in the rate of Coronavirus infections. That's more than half the country. We'll look at why the numbers are so bad? This as the European Union is debating blocking visitors from the U.S. or any country which is yet to bring the pandemic under control.
And the FBI says the noose found in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace's garage was in fact there for months and says he was not the victim of a hate crime. The cases of COVID-19 are rising around the world and in the United States a top health official says the virus has ""Brought the country to its knees"".
The Director of the Centers for Disease Control was speaking at a congressional hearing yesterday over half of all states are seeing more new cases. Look at this seven-day moving average. New confirmed cases are almost back to where they were in April. And officials say it is not just because they're doing more testing.
Meanwhile, deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean have surpassed 100,000 and I'm talking here about deaths, not cases. That's according to Johns Hopkins tallies and government figures. Brazil accounts for more than half of that entire total.
And European Union member states are talking about banning travelers from several countries including the United States. Lucy Kafanov has more on the escalating crisis across the country.
LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: On Capitol Hill, an urgent warning from the nation's Top Infectious Disease Doctor as President Trump campaigned on the other side of the country in Arizona, one of the states experiencing a rapid increase in reported Coronavirus cases.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: We're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections. The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surging that we're seeing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: New weekly infections are on the rise in at least 26 states including California, reporting 5,000 new cases its highest daily count since the start of the pandemic. Here in Texas, one of the first states to start reopening, Governor Greg Abbott says it's possible restrictions can be back.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GREG ABBOTT, TEXAS GOVERNOR: Because the spread is so rampant right now, there is never a reason for you to have to leave your home unless you do need to go out. The safest place for you is at your home.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: There is no statewide man mandate for wearing masks in Texas, nor is there in Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis is still resisting issuing one.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RON DESANTIS, FLORIDA GOVERNOR: Catch more flies with honey than vinegar. And you attach criminal penalties for something, you got to enforce it. And the question is, in some of the parts of Florida, is that really a good use of resources?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: A county face mask rule was not enforced at Trump's indoor event at an Arizona mega church as the state reported a new single day record of cases at nearly 3600, Dr. Anthony Fauci giving this advice to help slow the spread.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. FAUCI: Plan A, don't go in a crowd. Plan B, if you do, make sure you wear a mask.

KAFANOV: Fauci, along with other top health officials, testifying before House Committee about the Trump Administration's response to the Coronavirus.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: Trump's staff said he was kidding. But according to the President- -
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I don't kid by having more cases, it sounds bad. But actually what it is, we're finding people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: Fauci telling lawmakers he was unaware of any delays.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: To my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KAFANOV: And on the question of a possible vaccine--
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: I still think there is a reasonably good chance that by the very beginning of 2021, that if we're going to have a vaccine that we will have it by then.

GORANI: All right. As I mentioned earlier the European Union is considering banning travelers from several countries as restrictions are eased. That ban could include travelers from the United States. An EU diplomat told CNN the bloc wants to prohibit travel from countries where the virus is circulating most actively.
To be noted that whatever that the EU decides, it's up to individual countries to enforce any ban. Richard Quest joins me now for more on this. So since there's free movement within Schengen the block, if each individual country has their own ban how does that make sense since you can move freely between countries?
[10:05:00]
GORANI: Does that have to be a whole EU decision and impose the ban overall?
RICHARD QUEST, EDITOR-AT-LARGE: That's exactly the point. Hala, the Schengen free zone has broken down and has stopped in the late of March when the EU itself put internal restrictions on movement within Schengen.
And they're desperate - desperate to get Schengen back up and running again. So that's why they have to agree, a common list of countries that will be banned, and pretty much everyone has to go along with it. Because for the reason you have just said, first of all, let's say you're Greece and you want U.S. Tourists.
Well, first of all, have you got direct flights from the United States? If you have, then your borders with the rest of the EU won't be able to come down in case those American tourists go elsewhere in the EU and vice versa.
If you're coming from a third country to say Frankfurt and then on to Greece, no, the EU wants to get Schengen back up and running and the only way they can do it is unanimity amongst the members to all agree to this list.
And as you just said, Hala, the numbers tell their own story. Per 100,000 new cases about six. Per 100,000 populations in the United States, well over a hundred.
GORANI: Yes, but I mean, presumably there's disagreement between the countries that rely a lot on tourism Greece, Spain and others and countries that don't need tourists as much. Are they coming together? Are they going to come to some sort of common understanding about the U.S. in particular here?
QUEST: I think that the haggling is going on now. If I know it is. The haggling is going on now because they're desperate to provide a united front. And yes, look, I'm sure there are some countries, but it's not easy to see your way around it if you were to let the U.S. in, well, then you have problems with Russia because your definitional reason for letting the U.S. in, Russia also meets that criteria.
And so you start - once you shift this goalpost and then you can arguably put in restrictions and quarantine requirements and PCR testing requirements from those specific countries. But you're now creating a minefield.
And it starts to look like the United Kingdom's household this, bubble that. My feeling is that if they - if they're going to let the United States in, they're going to have to cast a wider net and at the moment certainly as the U.S. seems to show no willingness to reduce that number, you know, European leaders are gob smacked, to be frank, that the leader of the United States is basically doing everything that the scientists and advisers tell you not to do.
GORANI: Richard Quest, we'll see you later on ""Quest Means Business"" thanks. More than 9 million cases of Coronavirus very confirmed worldwide with the Americas including the U.S. becoming the most recent epicenter.
Joining us me is David Nabarro, he was appointed as the Special Envoy for the World Health Organization to help with the Coronavirus pandemic. Thank you, sir, for being with us. First your take on what's going on in the United States? You have states like Arizona, Texas and California that are at levels we haven't seen since April. What's your reaction to that?
DR. DAVID NABARRO, W.H.O. COVID-19 SPECIAL ENVOY: Please take this virus really seriously. It hasn't gone away. It's very much there. Please respect what the public health folk are telling you to do. They're saying it for a reason. Please protect yourself and others, maintaining physical distance, wearing a mask when you're in public places, and if you're not at all well, don't go out.
It's really important that we recognize that this virus is dangerous, and we've all got to work to get on top of it. I really ask everybody in the U.S., and indeed, everybody everywhere to go on taking this virus seriously. Please.
GORANI: So do you think some of these states opened too quickly, or in the case of the United Kingdom, for instance, with pubs and restaurants scheduled to open on July 4th, do you think all of this is a bit too soon?
NABARRO: I just want to make sure that as countries reduce their lockdowns and improve opportunities for people to move, that they're clear with their people on what are the basic steps that we all have to take to avoid the risk of infection.
[10:10:00]
NABARRO: And that they've got strong defenses in every community, so that if outbreaks do build up, they're dealt with quickly and efficiently. It really is important that the messages are clear and that the basics are in place. Then you can, of course, release the lockdowns. You can encourage movement, because you know what you're doing.
And it is important to continue testing because that's the only way you know where the virus is? We're dealing, frankly, with an enemy. It's an unseen enemy, and we need to do everything possible not to let the enemy actually defeat us, and it defeats us if we don't take it seriously.
GORANI: I could see you won't be drawn on specific countries I can understand why, but the World Health Organization did single out the United Kingdom. The World Health Organization Spokesperson had this to say about Britain.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. MARGARET HARRIS, SPOKESWOMAN, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: You have done well. You have really brought down your numbers. I mean, the UK has brought a very difficult outbreak right down. Very good news in the last couple of days about the limitation of the cases and then far fewer people dying. So now it's the moment to celebrate that by being super careful.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
NABARRO: Yes.
GORANI: Why congratulate a country that has the highest per capita death rate of any develop - of any nation apart from Belgium?
NABARRO: Well, Hala, I mean, I have to be clear with you and with everybody. When we're in the World Health Organization, we have to operate within the space that governments give us and most of the time governments are really prepared to accept our advice, but occasionally they really don't like it.
So we tend always to look for the positive. I think what Dr. Harris was doing and it was pretty clear to me when I listened to her remarks actually as she said them, she said, look, don't behave as though the virus has gone away. Don't go out and celebrate as though suddenly you've got out of some kind of detention.
This is a very different situation. The virus is still here. Please go on respecting it and I think that is the instruction that we should be giving to everybody. We're not allowed to give instructions because we operate through a consent mechanism, so what we have got to say to everybody is please take it seriously.
We have to go on beseeching them because that is the way in which we have to work. But it is a very, very strong beseeching request from people like me. Take this virus seriously.
GORANI: Should you believe that the wearing of masks should be compulsory?
NABARRO: I wear a mask when I'm in public places. I wear a mask for two reasons. Firstly, if I have got the virus, I want to make sure I'm not passing it on to other people. If I'm in a situation where somebody might have the virus, I want to try to reduce my risk of getting it.
I'm 70 and I take it very, very seriously. I also would practice physical distancing. I also look after older people and people who are frail and make sure they're not at risk. I do this because I know my behavior has a huge impact on the well-being of other people.
Often the people who are most at risk are those who don't have the space and the time and the opportunity to protect themselves. They're low paid they're in jobs where they have to service. So I think also wearing a mask is an important sign of respect to others whose risks are greater than mine.
So I'm really encouraged - I really encourage everybody to wear it and personally I believe that in particular settings like public transport, it ought to be compulsory.
GORANI: And last question, I mean, we have been speaking pretty regularly since the beginning of this pandemic. What is your frame of mind personally now? Are you more hopeful than you were a few months ago, less hopeful? Why or why not? When you look at the next few months, what is your frame of mind, your outlook?
NABARRO: On my desk I have a graph that shows numbers of reported COVID cases and deaths every day. And I study it really carefully even though I know that there are many more cases that are in my graph, I am very disturbed that there is now an acceleration of reported COVID around the world, particularly in poor countries.
[10:15:00]
NABARRO: I'm really worried about what this is going to do for the economies of poor countries in the months to come because the virus isn't going to go away. I'm also similarly worried about what's happening in the countries that are being - that have been able to reduce the COVID like here in Western Europe?
I'm worried that they will not be able to maintain it because the people will not be fully focused on what has to be done. So my wish is to just simply continue in a very gentle way to remind people everywhere that this virus is extremely dangerous and stealthy and we have to do everything possible to get on top of it.
GORANI: Dr. David Nabarro, thank you for joining us as always.
NABARRO: Thank you, Hala.
GORANI: And we appreciate your time and thank you for reminding us of the dangers of this virus and how concerned health care professionals still are about the future potentially?
Still ahead, another round of primary elections in the U.S, we'll tell you why one of the most closely watched races won't be decided until next week? Plus, NASCAR's Bubba Wallace speaks to CNN after the FBI determined he was in fact not the victim of a hate crime. Why he says he's still angry though, coming up?
GORANI: Voters in several U.S. states cast ballots yesterday in primaries delayed by the Coronavirus pandemic. Kentucky vastly reduced the number of polling places across the state but didn't experience the huge wait times seen a few weeks ago in Georgia. There are however many mail in ballots to count meaning it will be days before we know who will face Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in November. And there were other interesting races of note Tuesday including the defeat of a candidate endorsed by President Donald Trump in a North Carolina runoff vote.
Stephen Collinson joins me now live with that. So, where should we start? Let's start with Kentucky, because turnout could break a record there. There were some complaints that people standing in line at some polling stations because the number of polling stations was reduced, were shut out.
Eventually a judge issued an order that compelled authorities there in Kentucky to keep the doors open. What's going on in a state like Kentucky? Why is turnout so high?
STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Hala, what's really interesting about Kentucky is as you say a large number of absentee and mail-in voters. This gives us a real point to what might happen in November, with people worried about going out to vote at their polling places during the Coronavirus pandemic.
[10:20:00]
This of course is also coming at a time when President Donald Trump is basically making all sorts of false claims that mail-in voting invites fraud so it's very interesting. It shows there's great enthusiasm for voting ahead of the election and by mail.
What that means as you said though is that it can take hours and perhaps even days and even weeks for the results of these elections to come in as all these mail-in votes accounted. That also gives us a little bit of pause as we look forward to November if we have a selection between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in the presidential race.
There's every chance that they could take a long time to find out the results and given the way the President has already said that this election is the most flawed and fraudulent in history. That could point us towards a political crisis.
HALA GORANI, CNN HOST: Right, well, he's saying that and obviously, factually, that is not correct. Mail-in voting has not been shown to increase fraud. He himself votes by mail. His kids do. The Vice President has, et cetera. In North Carolina, very interesting result.
The GOP challenger beating a Trump-backed candidate and this GOP challenger whose name is Madison Cawthorn is 24 years old. I mean, this can't be good news for the Trump campaign that the Trump backed candidate is beaten by some newcomer nobody's heard of.
COLLINSON: Certainly and this is a much more down the line, orthodox, conservative Republican that we saw in the years before President Trump came to power. He's by no a Trumpist, populist candidate. Obviously, this is one primary election. Elections tend to be very small in primaries with just the most committed activist voters taking part but North Carolina is a state where President Trump must win if he's going to win back the White House.
It's also a swing state. President Obama actually won it in 2008 so even if there is a small fall off of President Donald Trump's vote in North Carolina among people, my previously been minded to support a Republican presidential candidate. That could be very bad news.
So there are plenty of caveats but you're exactly right. It's not an encouraging sign, a tool for the President.
GORANI: All right, Stephen Collinson. Thank you. Now to a developing story, we've been following all this week. The FBI now says that NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace was in fact not the target of a hate crime.
Investigators say the noose that was found in his garage had been there since last October, long before the garage was assigned to Wallace. He wasn't assigned this until last week according to NASCAR. The rope was used to pull the garage door closed and wasn't there to racially harass Wallace.
Wallace is the sport's only black top-circuit driver and he tells CNN, he doesn't care how long it's been there but it's still a noose.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: I'm pissed, I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity and they're not stealing that away from me but they're just trying to test that but image that I have and I've seen of what was handing in my garage is not a - it's not a garage tool. I've - I've been racing all my life.
We've raced out of hundreds of garages that never had garage tools like that. It was a noose that was whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose. So it wasn't directed to me but somebody tied a noose. That's what I'm saying. It was - it is a noose.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GORANI: Well, Nick Valencia is following this story from Talladega, Alabama so that's quite a twist but Bubba Wallace is saying, I don't care that it's been there for months. It's still a symbol that is offensive.
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right and he you know, we don't want to forget, he led the charge to get the Confederate flag removed from the sport and many people at the time saw it as a troubling reminder of the racism that exists in NASCAR.
They felt as though that he was targeted and in fact it was a NASCAR president Hala that first mentioned the - the noose to Bubba Wallace. He made it very clear in his interview with CNN that he never saw the noose. It was a member of his team that spotted it and was so concerned about it that they elevated it to the NASCAR president who then pulled Bubba Wallace aside in a private conversation to tell him that he was a victim of a hate crime and you heard from him just there.
He says in his own words that he's pissed. He feels as though some Americans are questioning his integrity. Some have gone so far as to accuse him of manufacturing a hoax but let's be clear, the DOJ and the FBI and their investigation found no evidence that this was a hate crime.
[10:25:00]
There's video in fact on YouTube, Hala, posted in 2019 of this garage. It shows the rope in this garage. A NASCAR saying that there's no way that anyone could have known that Bubba Wallace was going to use this garage number four here at Talladega when he raced.
But you know this is starting to make you know, these quiet conversations surrounding the sport about you know, the Confederate flag racism among fans. You know Bubba Wallace is the only top tier black driver in the sport. You know, this has really you know had a lot of conversations going beyond what we saw here, this past weekend.
The sport is addressing it, saying that they are committed to creating an inclusive environment and Bubba Wallace saying that he feels as though he's being unfairly targeted and says that he had nothing to do with this at all. Hala.
GORANI: Any reaction from the fans?
VALENCIA: You know, it's interesting because on Sunday, just before the race across the street from where we're standing here, fans were selling Confederate flag memorabilia after the Confederate flag was removed from the sport so you see fans criticizing NASCAR for what they say is jumping the gun in a hyper charged environment but NASCAR saying that this was that perhaps the - or not perhaps, that this was the best possible outcome.
They feel as though that they were right in coming out and addressing this very quickly though that has left him open to criticism and that criticism you know, is pretty vocal even still today. Hala.
GORANI: Nick Valencia in Talladega. Thanks very much. A police officer involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky has been fired, three months after her death.
This is the name, Breonna Taylor that we've heard a lot over the last few weeks. Detective Brett Hankinson received a letter of his termination, Tuesday. Louisville's Police Chief says he found Hankinson's conduct to be 'a shock to the conscience.'
Taylor, a 26 year old black emergency worker was shot eight times after police broke down her door and in an attempted drug sting. No drugs were found and none of the officers involved have been charged.
Still ahead, we'll take you inside one of Beijing's coronavirus testing centers, as officials try to contain a cluster of cases there. Just how many tests they can do in one day may surprise you and coronavirus balancing act in the U.K. Find out why some of Britain's top doctors are alarmed at the reopening of shops, pubs and restaurants. We'll be right back.
[10:30:00]
GORANI: Around the world we're watching some nations recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, while others are struggling to get the virus under control. Globally we've reach more than 9.2 million confirmed cases according to Johns Hopkins University with more than 2.3 million of those recorded in the United States.
Because the number of cases keeps rising in the U.S., Europe is considering blocking Americans from visiting. It's an extreme measure as the EU looks to prevent another surge as it opens back up. Latin America and the Caribbean are also hard hit by the pandemic.
At this stage, there are more than 100,000 deaths in that region with half of those in Brazil. Back in China where the pandemic began, Beijing is experiencing a fresh outbreak of coronavirus cases. Authorities are conducting mass testing to get a cluster of infections under control.
Officials say the outbreak is being managed but they warned there will be new cases as the testing continues. CNN correspondent David Culver takes us to one of the Chinese capital's biggest testing sites.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Here in China you're looking at one of many mass testing sites that have been set up particularly within Beijing. This is following the wholesale food cluster outbreaks that happened more than a week ago. They'd say it's now under control but they are continuing testing in massive numbers and you've got here 19 rows set up.
This for 19 different communities that feed into this one mass testing site. Once people have registered, they're taken across this little way here, into these lines and let me show you where they end up. It's almost like getting in rides at an amusement park. You're getting in line there if you will.
I'll show you. Follow me over here and this is where the actual testing is done. It takes about 30 seconds. They've got about 100 staff members that work on two hour shifts and there they do the throat swab. They then take that sample and they'll put it in a refrigerator and then move on to the next person.
Usually it takes just a few days' time to get the results back and most people are only notified if they have a positive result. You can see over here, this is where the staff will take off all of their PPE, all of their protective equipment and they'll throw it away. It's kept in a safe separate area and the other staff that are about ready to come on shift, they get changed, suited up and go through a sanitation procedure in a separate facility to then keep this going really from 9:00 in the morning until 10:00 at night.
In three days' time that this has been operating, they've done about 20,000 tests. This was built overnight so they pop up relatively quickly. They will keep it going for as long as they need to, here within Beijing and they say as of now, they feel like they're on a good path and keeping this most recent cluster outbreaks under control.
But they are saying complacency is what they're trying to avoid with all of this. David Culver, CNN, Beijing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GORANI: Well, health experts in the U.K. are issuing some strong warnings about a likely second wave of coronavirus infections and that comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the country is ready to rise from hibernation.
His plan is to reopen pubs and restaurants on July 4. The U.K. has one of the world's highest death tolls from Covid-19 per capita. Public health leaders have just published a plea in the British medical journal saying urgent action is needed to prevent further loss of life.
Dr. Chaand Nagpaul is one of the physicians sounding the alarm about a second spike of Covid-19 cases. He's Chair of the Council of the British Medical Association and joins me now. You're sounding the alarm on a second wave but we're still in the first wave here.
Do you think it's a bit too early to open pubs and restaurants and museums and bars?
DR. CHAAND NAGPAUL, CHAIR, BRITISH MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: I think we have to be very cautious because what the government has said is that it will open these facilities with mitigations but what we haven't understood what those mitigations are.
So what we - what we need to be aware of is that in the U.K., we still have significant circulating spreads of the infection, an estimated 35,000 people as we speak are infected with coronavirus in the U.K.
The infection - the virus is just as infectious and contagious at it was when the pandemic started so if people mix and they're not given the right protections, you will basically spread infections. As simple as that.
And we've seen across the globe, outbreaks in other countries. Germany that was doing extremely well in Europe, have now had to lockdown two areas because of local outbreaks so none of us can be complacent and my biggest concern on behalf of the medical profession in the U.K. and in fact echoed by leaders of other medical organizations and nursing profession too, is that the government must be extremely cautious about how the lockdown is eased and exactly how we will mitigate against spread if people start being closer to each other and mixing more you know, between each other.
[10:35:00]
GORANI: But you say yourself, we don't know what these mitigating factors are and we've all been to pubs and bars and restaurants. You know, you can't wear a facemask. There's no point really. You're not going to stand two meters away from somebody when you're at a bar, even one meter is virtually impossible.
So you know, I guess we're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to open up and then see in 2 - 3 weeks down the line after July 4, was this a good idea?
NAGPAUL: I don't think that's the right way to go about it to wait and see. I think the government should put in place the measures it says. It uses the word Covid-secure opening of new facilities so we need to see exactly before the pubs or bars open, how will the government maintain social distancing.
Will there be protective screens. It might not be the same environments of a bar but if made the date but if it may be something that people will prefer to a bar being closed but will you be able to have protection that way. Of course you can't where face coverings in a bar but that in fact, in the U.K. at the moment there is face covering usage in general in an indoor places.
There is a requirement now to up to wear face coverings in public transport but not in supermarkets and shops and other indoor facilities and we would like the PMO to see that being the norm because we know that this virus spread through droplets. We know that wearing a face covering can reduce that from the wearer can reduce spread by about 80 to 90 percent.
And we know if two people near each other are both wearing face coverings, you reduce that infection risk, that transmission risks to about 1.5 percent so we want the government to make sure that those sorts of mitigations, the physical protection of screens for example in public areas are all in place before the lockdown is eased further.
GORANI: Right and would you - do you think it's a good idea to limit or even ban travel from countries that have high infection rates into the U.K. like the United States or Brazil or Russia? Do you think that's a - that's a good protective measure?
NAGPAUL: I think we have to follow the right science here. Remember, this is become a global situation after it started in one part of the world and spread so we know that this is a highly infectious virus that does spread from nation to nation.
So each nation needs to have the right measures to prevent further spread and that in fact benefits all of us because if you get a second wave of a pandemic or sorry, an epidemic in one country, that place is at risk you know globally.
So we do need to make sure there are stringent measures to not spend this infection globally and so you know I think the other thing to say is that in the U.K. at least, we are also concerned around the test and trace system because you can contain this virus, if you do what South Korea did, if you do what New Zealand did which is to act very promptly in identifying those people who are infected.
You identify their contacts, you isolate them and if you do that the virus doesn't spread but to be able to do that, you have to have a really comprehensive testing strategy and a public health contact tracing strategy and in the U.K. we were - while we were told by the government that we would have an Act in place a month ago, that has been pushed back now.
We're not sure when we'll get that Act and so those are the sorts of issues that every nation needs to grapple with, having a very, very competent and prompt test and trace system.
GORANI: Yes and not all countries have managed to pull that off successfully so you know, you're one of the signatories of the letter, asking officials certainly to increase and improve preparedness for potential second wave.
First of all, we talk about a second wave as though it's inevitable, is it?
NAGPAUL: No. I wouldn't say that our starting position is that a second wave is inevitable. We need to make every possible effort and leave no stone unturned to prevent a second wave. That is why we have called for this rapid review.
And this rapid review that we've called for alongside other signatories, it goes beyond party politics. It's not a review by the government. It's to bring together the various political parties and have a cross-parliamentary commission review within weeks so that we learn from what has happened in the past and make sure we're therefore better prepared for the future. So we must prevent as far as we can a second spike.
[10:40:00]
The second thing to say is that if there is an outbreak--
HALA GORANI, CNN HOST: Yes.
NAGPAUL: --in the UK, if you capture the area where you have an outbreak and you act promptly - again, you need a proper agile test and tracing system - you can contain the virus in that local area by having a local lockdown. So our aim would be to prevent--
GORANI: And that's - sorry to just jump in because I just want to - I wanted your opinion about what they're doing in Germany. That's what they're - I mean, they were congratulated and presented as a model of how to manage the pandemic in the early days, but then they've had this huge outbreak in a meat processing plant. And what they've done is they've basically fenced off one area rather than implement a nationwide lockdown. Is that what our future is going to look like, do you think, until we get a vaccine, where little spikes in localized areas will be sort of contained locally?
NAGPAUL: Yes. So the one thing that they did do well is they identified the 1,500 quickly. And they've now taken an approach to contain the spread of the virus to those areas by a local lockdown. Now, that may well be what we need to do because that is surely better than having an entire nation have to go into a second severe lockdown.
So it makes sense, and that measure has been also employed in some of the other nations in the east such as South Korea where you act at the first signs of an outbreak, you don't wait for it to become a national problem. So that is, I believe, the way in which nations need to act promptly to stop the spread across the country.
GORANI: Yes. Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, thank you very much - the Chair of the British Medical Association Council, thank you for joining us on CNN.
Russia is celebrating with a bit of delay the 75th anniversary of defeating the Nazis in World War II with a massive military parade in Moscow. The Victory Day Parade was originally postponed because of the pandemic, but now falls one week before a crucial vote that could allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power for another 15 years. CNN's Matthew Chance has more on this.
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's extraordinary to see how Russia is staging this massive military parade even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the country. Officials say measures have been put in place to prevent mass infections.
More than 14,000 socially distanced troops were held in quarantine for two weeks before the event took place, as were the invited veterans of the Second World War, some now in their 90s, who watched the parade to mark the end of that conflict 75 years ago from specially built platforms on Red Square.
Speaking ahead of the march-past, Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, paid tribute to the Soviet and allied soldiers killed in the conflict, but he also spoke about the present, calling for international cooperation to solve current global problems. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (Translated): We understand how important it is to strengthen friendship and trust between peoples and are open to dialogue and cooperation on the most pressing issues on the international agenda. Among them, the creation of a common, reliable security system, which a complex, rapidly changing world needs.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CHANCE: Well, it's the political backdrop though that's perhaps the most interesting aspect of this annual Victory Day Parade. This extravagant display of military power and patriotism comes just a week before Russia decides on a new constitution that could allow Putin already in power since 2000 to remain in charge until 2036. Now, his approval ratings have been at all-time lows in recent months. And despite the public health concerns, the lifting of pandemic restrictions and the staging of this military parade may help bolster the Kremlin's popularity ahead of that crucial vote.
Matthew Chance, CNN.
GORANI: And this news just in to CNN. A U.S. Appeals Court has ordered a lower court to dismiss Michael Flynn's case, which effectively exonerates him if there are no more appeals. President Trump's Former National Security Adviser pleaded guilty twice to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador.
[10:45:00]
Last month, the Justice Department moved to dismiss the case, but the trial judge asked for a review of the decision. The Appeals Court found that the judge didn't have enough reason to question the Justice Department decision. So Michael Flynn, obviously, the Former National Security Adviser, didn't spend much time in his post, having admitted to lying to the FBI twice with this dismissal by an appeals court there supporting the decision to dismiss the case.
Coming up on the program, another company joins the movement to stop the spread of hate, calling on the social media giant to make changes. Details on this current campaign coming up.
GORANI: The Facebook ad boycott is growing. Now, ice-cream make Ben & Jerry's announced that it's pulling advertising from Facebook and Instagram beginning July 1st. Several companies have joined the StopHateForProfit campaign, a group of civil rights organizations launched this last week. They accuse the social media giant of failing to address hate messages in a meaningful way. Facebook says it aims to have conversations with campaign organizers about being a force for good.
CNN Tech Reporter Brian Fung joins me now live from Washington, D.C. with more. And Facebook has been criticized before for allowing some groups to either post factually incorrect messages or hate groups to have a platform. But I guess this is different because these are corporations essentially - potentially hurting Facebook in the pocket book by pulling advertising money.
BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Yes. Hala, it looks like this boycott is really gaining steam with joining of Ben & Jerry's to this campaign. Let me read a little bit of the statement that Ben & Jerry's put out yesterday on its website. Ben & Jerry's is ""calling for Facebook to take stronger action to stop its platforms from being used to divide our nation, suppress voters, foment and fan the flames of racism and violence, and undermine our democracy."" So some very strong words here from Ben & Jerry's.
Of course, it's not the only company to be joining this boycott. In recent days, we've seen companies, including Eddie Bauer, Patagonia, The North Face, REI, and Magnolia Pictures, which is the film studio behind movies like ""Man on Wire"" and ""Food, Inc.,"" all coming out against Facebook saying that they're responsible for spreading misinformation and hate speech and that they won't support the company for as long as it does so, calling for a boycott of these platforms for about a month in July.
[10:50:00]
Of course, some of these companies have said they'll go further potentially indicating that this boycott could last beyond July. Others have said that they will in addition to pulling their ads from Facebook and Instagram, they'll also suspend any organic content being created on those platforms. So, posts created by those companies on their accounts that are unpaid and are just normal content.
Of course, it's - none of these companies have said how much money they pour into Facebook every year. So we're a little bit in the dark as far as how much this really hurts Facebook's bottom line. But with every new company that comes out in support of this campaign, that's further fuelling this PR crisis for Facebook as it faces this backlash against how it's handled content on its platform.
GORANI: All right. Brian Fung, thanks very much, coming to us from Washington.
It is a busy day for football in the Premier League, and Liverpool can come one step closer to ending a 30-year title drought - is what I'm being told. We'll be right back with that.
GORANI: All right. Welcome back. It's another busy day of sports. And joining me now to talk about that is Don Riddell. What can we expect today?
DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT: Five games in the Premier League, Hala. When was the last time that we could say that? And it's particularly important for Liverpool. They're one of the biggest brand names in world football. They've got fans all over the planet. For them, it has been an agonizing 30-year wait for a title delayed further by the coronavirus pandemic, but they are now closing in on what would be their first-ever Premier League title.
The Reds have actually dominated the league before the lockdown in March. Now they know that a win against Crystal Palace later this Wednesday will put them within touching distance. Liverpool need a total of just five points to do it. And if they win today and if Manchester City fail to win Chelsea on Thursday, then the wait will be over. Manager Jurgen Klopp has been watching that title rivals Man City in action, reflecting on just how good his own team has been this season.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JURGEN KLOPP, LIVERPOOL MANAGER: But I realized when I watched the game last night just how is it possible that anybody is 20 points ahead of this team. That's pretty much unthinkable actually. And that's something because - so we must have done a couple of things really, really well and right that we could have situation there. But no, I don't think about City can catch us or whatever. I think about Crystal Palace. I'm really only concerned about what we are doing, and I'm only thinking about what we have to do in the next game and not what City is doing. I watch them because we play them in less than a week - so in eight days, nine days. And that's why I watch them, and not for hoping that they lose over there. I was never like this. Maybe I wanted them to lose last year against Leicester, but that didn't work really well. So that's why I have stopped doing that.
RIDDELL: Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Tottenham got their first win since the lockdown, beating West Ham, two-nil of home (ph). It's a result - I mean, Spurs had renewed hope of finishing in the top four and clenching at Champions League place that took the lead with an own goal midway through the second half before Harry Kane settled it eight minutes from time. These are bonus games for Kane. The lockdown gave him the chance to recover from an injury, which could have finished his season.
In Spain, the title race in La Liga remains tight after Barcelona's narrow victory against Athletic Bilbao. Just a one goal in it coming 90 minutes from time scored by substitute Ivan Rakitic.
[10:55:00]
And although it was far from convincing performance, the result does at least put pressure on Barca's title rival's Real Madrid.
Here's the table. As it stands, the catalons are three points ahead of Madrid, but that could change when Real play Mallorca later this Wednesday. If Real win, they'd be level on points with Barca, but they would sit on top of the table by virtue of their head-to-head record.
Now then in tennis, the fallout continues from Novak Djokovic's positive test for the coronavirus, after the ill-fated, not to mention the ill- advised Adria Tour series was scrapped. The world number one returned to his home in Belgrade and issued an apology video.
Djokovic was the third player to test positive from the series. His wife also now has the virus. Other players who weren't on the tour have been critical. Nick Kyrgios says it was boneheaded. Andy Murray criticized it too. But Murray said it won't necessarily jeopardize upcoming events like the U.S. Open in New York.
ANDY MURRAY, THREE-TIME MAJOR CHAMPION: I have seen some people who said that maybe this sort of puts U.S. Open in doubt, which it may well do, but this - the measures and the protocols they have in place so far in the U.S. is completely different than what was going on in Serbia and Croatia.
Obviously, there will be no fans for a start and I think all of the players now would be extremely aware that we can be impacted by this and coronavirus doesn't care who we are or what we do. And we need to - yes, we need to respect - we need to respect and respect the rules.
RIDDELL: That's an extraordinary story. The U.S. Open is still going ahead, but remains to be seen which players will be there in New York to play it. Back to you.

9,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Newstex Blogs",2020-09-10,"1397 words",NA,"Irene Jiang",NA,"I went on a food crawl through New York's Chinatown to witness how its restaurants are rebounding after devastating shutdowns — and saw how community is keeping Chinatown delicious",FALSE,"Sep 10, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex) Chinatown districts have been some of the hardest-hit by shutdowns, decreased tourist traffic, and racist stigma. I visited New York's Chinatown to talk to restaurant owners and managers about how their businesses are recovering. I also sampled some of their food, including taro ice cream, mochi donuts, and nasi lemak. Most of the people I spoke to said that while business isn't nearly as good as it was before the pandemic, things have stabilized into a new normal. 
Profitability is a distant dream, but businessowners remain hopeful that their local community will be able to sustain them through the end of the pandemic. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1].The coronavirus pandemic has turned the American Dream into a nightmare for many Asian Americans.In addition to facing a sharp increase in hate crimes[2], Chinatown districts across the country were also the first to see business drop as much as 80%[3] even before government shutdowns were put in place. One employment disruption study estimated that 28% of Asian American small businesses had closed by the end of April 2020[4] — compared to 17% of white-owned businesses.But neighborhood organizations have since stepped up to support Chinatown businesses. In New York City, the Chinatown Partnership[5] has built outdoor dining areas for restaurants, while Welcome to Chinatown[6] has raised more than $245,000 for small businesses. And in September, Send Chinatown Love[7] launched a self-guided food crawl to promote mostly cash-only restaurants without social media presences.I took a walk through New York's Chinatown last week and visited some of the businesses on the food crawl to see how they were doing and to sample some of their goods. Congee Village got a major business boost last year when it was named one of Michelin's 2020 Bib Gourmand picks. Now, the normally bustling restaurant relies on takeout. Source: Grubstreet[8] Things looked grim on the way down through the Bowery. Many businesses were closed, and for rent signs were plastered over graffiti-covered shutters. The first sign of life I encountered was Kuih Cafe, which specializes in Malaysian desserts and opened in late February. Owner Veronica Gan now runs every aspect of her business by herself. Because she'd been in business for less than a month when the pandemic started, she didn't qualify for a Paycheck Protection Program loan, and had to lay off her three employees. Gan told me that her dream was to bring Malaysian ""kuih,"" rice-based desserts, to New York. When she first started out, business was good. Now, she's tired all the time and can barely afford to cover expenses, let alone pay herself. ""I felt like giving up,"" Gan told me. But since things reopened in June, business has been slowly climbing back up. Gan's voice broke when she spoke about her desserts. She gave me two pandan coconut kuih to try. They were rich, gooey, delicate bites of sticky rice and brown sugar. I also had Gan's nasi lemak: coconut rice topped with fried anchovies, crispy peanuts, sambal (chili paste), and an egg. Gan added on some cuttlefish and acar awak, or pickled vegetables. Gan's nasi lemak was a flavor explosion: fishy, salty, sour, sweet, spicy, crunchy, and soft. Gan told me she tries to source her ingredients from Malaysia. She says Send Chinatown Love has helped send new customers her way. However, Gan says that if another shutdown happens, she will be forced to close. Parts of Chinatown are visibly depressed. There are entire streets devoid of economic activity. Next on the crawl was Happy Veggie Restaurant, a vegetarian Malaysian restaurant that opened in February just weeks before the shutdown. Manager Kelly Pan told me that business hasn't been good. ""It's been very hard,"" Pan said. ""We don't make a profit."" The restaurant signed up for Uber Eats, but didn't have time to establish a customer base before the shutdowns. Pan said that Send Chinatown Love helped the restaurant build an Instagram and a Yelp page, effectively helping it create an online presence. On the streets, there are still fruit vendors selling a myriad of Asian specialties such as rambutan, longan, dragonfruit, and more. This stretch of sidewalk is usually dense with tourists. Now, it's a leisurely stroll. Next, I visited Alimama Tea, a caf and bakery that's famous for its sparkly, creative treats. I spoke to owner Janie Wang, a Lower East Side native who founded the caf two and a half years ago. Wang's parents owned restaurants when she was growing up. But Wang said that she was inspired to create a radically different kind of menu. ""Everything that we have is unique,"" she told me. One of Alimama's most popular products is their mochi donut munchkin. It's a crispy-outside, gooey-inside ball of fragrant flavor: taro, chocolate, or matcha. Another one of Alimama's famous innovations is the boba cream puff, which is exactly what it sounds like: a massive flaky pastry filled with milk tea-flavored cream and chewy tapioca bits. Business is far from normal, but Wang says she's ""happy with what we have."" With no tourists around, Wang says she's able to focus on building connections with her neighbors and members of the community. ""Chinatown's about community,"" Wang said. ""All the neighbors know us."" Wang told me that all the stores on their block share a landlord, and were able to collectively bargain on their rent. Wang said that things have improved a lot for Alimama since the pandemic first began. ""It was very dangerous out, and there were very few people out."" With the passage of time and the addition of outdoor dining, things have started to liven up again, Wang said. Next, I stopped by the famous Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, a neighborhood landmark. Crystal Kong has worked at the store for five years, and now manages all three locations — there's one in Flushing and another on the Lower East Side. ""There's no tourist business but it's kind of nice, because we just serve a bunch of locals,"" Kong told me. Even so, Kong said, the store still gets busy on the weekends. Owners Christina and Phillip Seid make the shop's legendary unique ice cream flavors themselves. ""They're super down-to-earth people who love helping the community,"" Kong said. The Seids' ice cream incorporates flavors tailored to the community each store is situated in. I tried the taro and rose. They were creamy and packed with flavor, and extremely satisfying on a hot summer day. Kong said that since the Ice Cream Factory is something of an unofficial landmark, they decided to participate in the food crawl to help other businesses. ""It's a united front,"" Kong said. One of the stops on the food crawl is New Golden Fung Wong Bakery, which is the oldest mooncake bakery in Chinatown. Its specialty, of course, is the mooncake: a dense Chinese pastry with fillings like red bean paste and lotus. It's traditionally served during the Mid-Autumn Festival and for other special occasions. Alas, the human stomach is a finite entity. And near the end, my food crawl became more of a food waddle. Sometimes, I wish I could order and eat all the food in Chinatown. But Chinatown is so chock full of good food that even with even during a pandemic, there's still a surplus of restaurants serving up someone's life passion. To my relief, it seemed I wasn't the only one who wished I could eat all of Chinatown. The distanced tables were full of hungry patrons, and the streets were active, if not buzzing. And the sense of community felt stronger than ever. New York's Chinatown is not dead — far from it. It's not even dormant. It's simply still delicious.

Lawmakers of both parties, eyeing the companies' tremendous power to disseminate speech and ideas, are looking to challenge their long-enjoyed bedrock legal protections for online speech－the stated topic for the hearing but one quickly overtaken by questions related to the presidential campaign.
With worries over election security growing, senators on the Commerce Committee extracted promises from Twitter's Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai that their companies will be on guard against meddling by foreign actors or the incitement of violence around the election results.
Testifying via video, the executives said they are taking several steps, including partnerships with news organizations, to distribute accurate information about voting. Dorsey said Twitter was working closely with state election officials.
Republicans, led by Trump, have accused the social media platforms, without evidence, of deliberately suppressing conservative views. They say that behavior has reached new heights in the contest between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
Republican Senator Roger Wicker, the committee's chairman, said the laws governing online speech must be updated because ""the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack"".
Wicker cited the move this month by Facebook and Twitter to limit dissemination of an unverified story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Biden.
The story, which was not used by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump's supporters.
""Twitter's conduct has by far been the most egregious,"" Senator Ted Cruz told Dorsey. Cruz cited Twitter's limitations on the newspaper story as part of ""a pattern of censorship and silencing Americans with whom Twitter disagrees"".
""Who the hell elected you? And put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?"" Cruz asked.
Algorithms highlighted
Dorsey told Cruz that he does not believe that Twitter can influence elections because it's only one source of information. He tried to steer senators away from conventional notions of political bias, noting that ""much of the content people see today is determined by algorithms"".
On Tuesday, Facebook stopped accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close on Nov 3, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned.
Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats focused their criticism mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence, keep people from voting or spread falsehoods about the coronavirus.
They criticized the tech CEOs for failing to police content, blaming the platforms for playing a role in hate crimes and the rise of white supremacy in the United States.
The CEOs argued the liability shield has helped make the internet what it is today, though Zuckerberg said he believes Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended"". Dorsey and Pichai urged caution in making any changes.

It always starts with words Time to reset: more brilliant ideas to remake the world",FALSE,"The year 2020 hasn't solely been defined by the pandemic, rising unemployment, deepening economic inequalities and a critical time for the climate emergency. There has also been an alarming increase in hate crimes across the world.
In Poland, LGBTQ communities have become enemy number one. In Hungary, neo-Nazi crowds organise demonstrations to expel the Roma communities. More than half of the hate crimes in New York last year targeted Jewish citizens. In Germany, there has been a dangerous increase in attacks against minorities and refugees. In the UK, Home Office figures indicate a surge in hate crimes, including those against sexual minorities and transgender citizens. In Turkey, Brazil and India, a dangerous form of dogmatism continues to brew. All these seemingly disparate events have one fundamental thing in common: a systematic hatred of and bias against people who are regarded as different; the dehumanisation of the ""other"".
History has shown that it doesn't start with concentration camps or mass murder, or civil war or genocide. It always starts with words: stereotypes, cliches, tropes. The fight against dehumanisation, therefore, also needs to start with words. Stories. It is easier to make sweeping generalisations about others if we know close to nothing about them; if they remain an abstraction. To move forward, we need to reverse the process: start by rehumanising those who have been dehumanised. And for that we need the art of storytelling.
Data and factual information are crucial, but not enough to bring down the walls of numbness and indifference, to help us empathise with people outside our tribes. We need emotional connections. But more than that, just as we need sisterhood against patriarchy, we need storyhood against bigotry. East or west, when we relate to others we do so through stories. Literature can be incredibly powerful, universally relevant and, most importantly, a healing force.
 True, Doris Lessing was right when she said literature was analysis after the event. Writers need time to process, to digest, to analyse. But in the post-Covid world, when everything is shifting with bewildering speed, and there is so much hurt and pain and injustice everywhere, literature also has to become analysis during the event.
Under austerity, we have seen libraries shut, cultural centres neglected. Now, with the impact of coronavirus, the arts and culture are once again endangered. At a time when inequalities are deepening and prejudices escalating, we urgently need public and private support for creativity, especially among disadvantaged communities. There is a direct relation between coexistence, inclusion, democracy in a society and how well supported its creative industries are. This is not a luxury, but something as vital and urgent as the air we breathe.
The art of storytelling is one of our last remaining democratic spaces. Now it must become one of our main acts of resistance against dehumanisation.

Responding to President Trump's tweet calling a proposed Black Lives Matter sign in New York City a 'symbol of hate,' Abdullah — who also serves as the chairwoman of California State University, Los Angeles' Pan-African Studies Department — said,'I think it's the height of hypocrisy for Donald Trump to call anything a symbol of hate.

The unknown vandal or vandals damaged the kitchen, dining room and storage area. They destroyed bottles of wine, broke tables, and shattered glasses and dishes. They also spray-painted walls and artwork with racist remarks directed at the restaurant's Sikh owners.
The incident, which Santa Fe police have labeled a hate crime, has devastated the Singh family and left the community shocked and outraged.
""This is our livelihood, you know,"" Baljot Singh said. ""And seeing it torn down and vandalized, it hurt. It truly broke our heart.""
Singh's friend Cameron Brown said he reported the incident to police around 1p.m. Monday after owner Baljit Singh called to alert him about the attack.
""As soon as I walked into the door, I saw the buffet laying on the ground, busted open. On the door, I saw white supremacist stuff,"" Brown said. "" 'Go back home.' 'Go back to your country.' ""
The words ""Trump 2020"" and racial slurs were spray-painted around the restaurant, he said.
Singh and Brown have been using the restaurant for the last five weeks as a place to prepare food and care packages for homeless people in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vandal or vandals destroyed these supplies, leaving packaged goods strewn across the restaurant's dining room.
Baljit Singh said it was the first time he had faced such an incident at India Palace, which has been operating just a block off the Plaza on Don Gaspar Avenue for some 30 years.
While he was dismayed by the destruction, Singh said, he also was upset about the more than three hours it took for Santa Fe police to respond to a report of the crime.
Deputy Chief Paul Joye said the delay was due to officers responding to a report of a robbery about 20 minutes earlier in the 1000 block of Velarde Street, off Agua Fría Street.
The crime at India Palace is considered a burglary because someone broke in and damaged property, Joye said, while a robbery involves force or the threat of force or violence.
""We have to prioritize life over property, and a robbery is a crime against a person,"" Joye said. ""That's an immediate threat to life.""
He said the attack at India Palace is considered a hate crime, which is not a separate charge. Rather, it is label police use when the motivation for a crime is based on factors such as a person's race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity, Joye said.
Under New Mexico law, the hate crime label can lead to enhanced penalties.
The Sikh Coalition, a civil liberties and advocacy organization based in New York, released a statement Tuesday morning saying the FBI, as well as local and state government leaders, are part of a task force looking into the attack.
The FBI did not confirm its involvement in a task force.
But Frank Fisher, a spokesman for the agency's office in Albuquerque, said it has offered its assistance to local police.
""If in the course of the local investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,"" Fisher said.
The India Palace attack has been widely condemned by public officials and advocacy organizations. It comes amid heightened awareness of racial issues in the state and across the nation following the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Demonstrations have been held in New Mexico in support of the national Black Lives Matter movement, which is calling for defunding police and for an end to systemic racism. Indigenous advocacy groups also have called for the removal of monuments they decry as racist.
Other groups have pushed back against Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber's plan to remove some monuments from downtown sites.
The obelisk on the Plaza, a war monument that was the focus of a protest last week, was tagged with graffiti Monday.
Webber addressed the racial attack on India Palace in a statement Tuesday morning, calling the hate crime ""sickening and appalling.""
""We need to stand up as a community and denounce this despicable act,"" Webber said. ""We will find whoever did it and punish them to the full extent of the law.
""The Singhs are a long-standing Sikh family that has used its own resources to feed homeless Santa Feans through the goodness of their hearts,"" he continued. ""For them to be attacked this way breaks our hearts.""
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham posted a Twitter message Tuesday morning saying she had spoken with Baljit Singh and ""let him know that our community is with him.""
""We will not stand for such hatred in New Mexico,"" Lujan Grisham said.
City Councilor Signe Lindellarrived at the restaurant early Tuesday afternoon and said the vandalism would be discussed at Wednesday's council meeting.
""People are heartbroken about this,"" Lindell said. ""Just heartbroken. I mean, it's kind of this step into a place that we just don't even want to imagine.""
The Anti-Defamation League's Mountain States Region released a statement Tuesday saying the organization was ""deeply disturbed"" by the incident.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations also condemned the attack.
""No community should ever experience this disgusting bigotry and racism,"" said Sim Singh, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the Sikh Coalition.
""These racist acts are meant to divide us, but we are strongest when we stand together,"" he added.
Support for the restaurant has poured in from the community. Many people stopped by the restaurant Tuesday afternoon to leave bouquets of flowers, cards, notes saying they wanted to help clean up the damage and even cash.
Multiple fundraising campaigns also have been launched to aid India Palace. A GoFundMe campaign started by fellow Indian restaurant Paper Dosa had raised nearly $57,000 by Tuesday evening.
In all, the campaigns had raised more than $100,000.
Some people were posting messages on social media questioning whether the attack was a hoax. Brown said he had seen such comments.
""I wish this was not real. I wish this was not happening, but it's happening,"" he said.
Brown and Baljot Singh said they do not know who is responsible for the attack. They cited a violent incident Thursday involving an armed man who had parked in the restaurant's reserved spots in a city lot, though it was unclear if the altercation was related to the break-in.
Brown said he had left a note on the man's car, asking him not to park there again.
Later in the day, when Brown was inside the restaurant speaking with a customer on the phone, he could hear the man yelling at Baljit Singh, he said. He went outside to intervene.
""It just gets worse and worse, and he decides he's going to try and fight with me and then he tries to pull out his gun,"" Brown said.
Sikhs, members of a South Asian religion, have faced increased discrimination since 9/11. The FBI's 2018 report on hate crimes found there was a 200 percent increase in anti-Sikh incidents from the previous year.
Baljot Singh said he was often bullied in school for wearing a turban while he was growing up and has ""been called a lot of nasty things, and it just wasn't right.""
""A lot of people are not educated about what the Sikh culture is, and they need to be,"" he said."

MIAMI — Hospitals rapidly approached capacity across the Sunbelt, and the Miami area closed restaurants and gyms again because of the surging coronavirus Monday, as the U.S. emerged from a Fourth of July weekend of picnics, pool parties and beach outings that health officials fear could fuel the rapidly worsening outbreak.
The seesaw effect — restrictions lifted, then reimposed — has been seen around the country in recent weeks and is expected again after a holiday that saw crowds of people celebrating, many without masks.
“We were concerned before the weekend and remain concerned post-holiday, as anecdotal stories and observed behavior indicate that many continue to disregard important protective guidance,” said Heather Woolwine, a spokeswoman for the Medical University of South Carolina.
Confirmed cases are on the rise in 41 out of 50 states plus the District of Columbia, and the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is increasing in 39 states.
Florida, which recorded an all-time high of 11,400 new cases Saturday and has seen its positive test rate lately reach more than 18%, has been hit especially hard, along with other Sunbelt states such as Arizona, California and Texas.

Justices rule states can bind presidential electors' votes
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a decision flavored with references to “Hamilton” and “Veep,” the Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that states can require presidential electors to back their states’ popular vote winner in the Electoral College.
The ruling, in cases in Washington state and Colorado just under four months before the 2020 election, leaves in place laws in 32 states and the District of Columbia that bind electors to vote for the popular-vote winner, as electors almost always do anyway.
So-called faithless electors have not been critical to the outcome of a presidential election, but that could change in a race decided by just a few electoral votes. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
A state may instruct “electors that they have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her majority opinion that walked through American political and constitutional history with an occasional nod to pop culture.
Such an order by a state ""accords with the Constitution — as well as with the trust of a Nation that here, We the People rule,” Kagan wrote.

Small business aid went beyond hard-hit companies, data show
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government on Monday identified roughly 650,000 mostly small businesses and nonprofits that received taxpayer money from a federal program that probably softened job losses from the coronavirus but also benefited some politically connected firms.
The Treasury Department’s Payroll Protection Program approved applicants from a broad swath of industries. Some that were less directly impacted by the pandemic, such as manufacturing and construction, received a greater proportion of the loans than the hard-hit restaurant and hotel industries. Many law firms and private equity companies also obtained loans.
Businesses owned by politicians also borrowed from the program, including a minor league baseball team owned by the family of the governor of Ohio. A large franchisee of Wendy's, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants, whose CEO is a major donor to President Donald Trump, received loans totaling $15 to $30 million.
Other recipients included Kanye West’s clothing and sneaker brand Yeezy, Ice Cube’s professional basketball league, Planned Parenthood clinics in more than two dozen states and the anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform.
As of June 30, the program had handed out $521 billion. The Treasury Department identified just a fraction of the total borrowers Monday, naming only companies that got more than $150,000. Those firms made up less than 15% of the nearly 5 million small companies and organizations that received loans.

Maxwell moved to NY for Epstein-related sex abuse charges
NEW YORK (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein's longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell was transferred Monday to New York to face charges that she recruited women and girls, one as young as 14, for him to sexually abuse, the Bureau of Prisons said.
Prosecutors have asked a judge to schedule a Friday court appearance in Manhattan federal court for for Maxwell, 58, who was arrested last week at a $1 million estate she had purchased in New Hampshire.
Maxwell, the daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was the former girlfriend and longtime close associate of Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail last August while he awaited trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
Maxwell has been indicted on multiple charges, including that she conspired to entice girls as young as 14 to engage in illegal sex acts with Epstein from 1994 through 1997.
Several of Epstein's victims have described Maxwell as his chief enabler, recruiting and grooming young girls for abuse. She has denied wrongdoing and called claims against her “absolute rubbish.”

NY count: 6,300 virus patients were sent to nursing homes
NEW YORK (AP) — New York hospitals released more than 6,300 recovering coronavirus patients into nursing homes during the height of the pandemic under a controversial, now-scrapped policy, state officials said Monday, but they argued it was not to blame for one of the nation's highest nursing home death tolls.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, which has taken intense criticism over the policy, instead contended the virus’ rampant spread through the state’s nursing homes was propelled by more than 20,000 infected home staffers, many of whom kept going to work unaware they had the virus.
“Facts matter. And those are the facts,” state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a news conference.
New York’s report came more than a month after The Associated Press did its own count finding that hospitals around the state released more than 4,500 recovering coronavirus patients to nursing homes under a March 25 Health Department directive that required nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients.
The directive was intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But several relatives, patient advocates and nursing administrators who spoke to the AP at the time blamed the policy for helping to spread the virus among the state’s most fragile residents. To date, more than 6,400 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in New York’s nursing home and long-term care-facilities.

Judge orders Dakota Access pipeline shut down pending review
FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered the Dakota Access pipeline shut down for additional environmental review more than three years after it began pumping oil — handing a victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and delivering a blow to President Donald Trump’s efforts to weaken public health and environmental protections his administration views as obstacles to businesses.
In a 24-page order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., wrote that he was “mindful of the disruption"" that shutting down the pipeline would cause, but that it must be done within 30 days. Pipeline owner Energy Transfer plans to ask a court to halt the order and will seek an expedited appeal, spokeswoman Vicki Granado said.
The order comes after Boesberg said in April that a more extensive review was necessary than what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers already conducted and that he would consider whether the pipeline should be shuttered during the new assessment.
“The Court does not reach its decision with blithe disregard for the lives it will affect,” Boasberg wrote Monday.
“Yet, given the seriousness of the Corps’ NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease,” he added.

AP Photos: Argentines have balcony parties amid quarantine
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — A few days of the silence and solitude of quarantine was all that Marcela Álvarez could stand.
She went to the balcony of her house in Buenos Aires' Villa Devoto neighborhood, wired up Christmas lights, set up a speaker and began playing music.
She feared that the neighbors would complain. Instead, they began doing the same, and ""the festival of the balconies” was born — an Argentine variant of the occasional street serenades that have popped up in countries around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Instead of separation, the quarantine measures imposed in March brought Alvarez, 53, together with people who had been strangers, dancing at their windows and balconies to rock, Latin music and reggaeton with disco-like lights anbd smoke.
“Today I am happy. I could connect with all my neighbors and I met a lot of people I didn't know, much better than in other moments,"" she said. “I hate what is happening with the coronavrus, but this has completely enriched my life.”

Trump lashes out at NASCAR, Wallace over flag and noose
WASHINGTON (AP) — NASCAR’s layered relationship with President Donald Trump took a sharp turn Monday when Trump blasted the racing organization for banning the Confederate flag and wrongly accused the sport’s only full-time Black driver of perpetrating “a hoax” when a crew member found a noose in the team garage stall.
Trump suggested Bubba Wallace should apologize after the sport rallied around him after the noose was found in his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime. NASCAR and the FBI have exclusively referred to the rope – which was used to pull the garage door closed – as a noose.
It was the only garage pull out of 1,684 stalls at 29 inspected NASCAR tracks to be fashioned as a noose.
NASCAR President Steve Phelps has bristled at suggestions the noose was a hoax. Wallace was shown a photograph of the noose, never personally saw it, and was told by NASCAR officials he was the victim of a hate crime.
“Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?” Trump tweeted. “That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!”

White woman charged after racist Central Park confrontation
NEW YORK (AP) — A white woman who called the police during a videotaped dispute with a Black man over her walking her dog without a leash in Central Park was charged Monday with filing a false police report.

Native American groups ask NFL to force Redskins name change
WASHINGTON (AP) — More than a dozen Native American leaders and organizations sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Monday calling for the league to force Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the team name immediately.
The letter was signed by 15 Native American advocates and obtained by The Associated Press. It demands the team and the NFL cease the use of Native American names, imagery and logos — with specific importance put on Washington, which last week launched a “ thorough review ” of its name.
The letter was delivered on the same day that President Donald Trump voiced his opposition to any name change by the team. Several team sponsors have come out in favor of change recently and Snyder showed his first indication of willingness to do so amid a nationwide movement to erase racially insensitive symbols.
According to their letter, the groups “expect the NFL to engage in a robust, meaningful reconciliation process with Native American movement leaders, tribes, and organizations to repair the decades of emotional violence and other serious harms this racist team name has caused to Native Peoples.”
The NFL did not immediately respond to a message confirming receipt of the letter. Goodell last week expressed support for Snyder's review process of the name."

NEW YORK, United States of America, August 23, 2020/APO Group/ -- In a message published on the International Day Commemorating the Victims of Violence Based on Religious Belief , which falls on 22 August, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned of a rise in racism since the spread of COVID-19 across the world.Mr. Guterres noted that the pandemic has been accompanied by ''a surge in stigma and racist discourse vilifying communities, spreading vile stereotypes and assigning blame.The UN Chief listed some of the disturbing examples of discrimination against religious minorities, such as attacks on people and religious sites, and hate crimes and atrocity crimes targeting populations because of their religion or belief.In order to counter this discrimination, Mr. Guterres called for more action to address the root causes of intolerance and discrimination by promoting inclusion and respect for diversity, as well as for the perpetrators of crimes of this nature to be held accountable.Freedom of religion is a human right''The right to freedom of religion or belief is firmly entrenched in international human rights law, said the Secretary-General, ''and is a cornerstone for inclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies.States, he added, have the primary responsibility to protect the right to freedom of religion and belief. Initiatives set up by Mr. Guterres to support them include his Call to Action for Human Rights , a Strategy on Hate Speech and a Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites .The International Day was created by a UN Resolution adopted in May 2019, in response to a rise of intolerance and violence based on religion or belief against individuals, which are often of a criminal nature. 
Launching his Strategy on Hate Speech in June 2019, Mr. Guterres said that ''a groundswell of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, violent misogyny, anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred are being seen around the world, and noted that, in some places, Christian communities were also being systematically attacked.The Strategy aims to enable the UN to respond to ''the impact of hate speech on societies, Mr. Guterres explained, by bringing individuals and groups together who have opposing views; working with traditional and social media platforms; and developing communications guidance.MENAFN238202000027471784ID1100681164"

Twenty state attorneys general on Wednesday called on Facebook to better prevent messages of hate, bias and disinformation from spreading, and said the company needed to provide more help to users facing online abuse.
In a letter to the social media giant, the officials said they regularly encountered people facing online intimidation and harassment on Facebook. They outlined seven steps the company should take, including allowing third-party audits of hate content and offering real-time assistance to users.
“We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do,” said the letter, which was addressed to Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. The officials who signed the letter, all of them Democrats, represent states including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, as well as the District of Columbia.
The letter adds to the rising pressure facing Mr. Zuckerberg and his company to stop disinformation and harassment on Facebook. Civil rights leaders, advertisers and some of the company’s own employees have criticized Facebook for failing to curtail the spread of noxious content. Extremists and conspiracists have turned to social media — most often Facebook, Twitter and YouTube — to circulate falsehoods about the coronavirus pandemic, the coming presidential election and Black Lives Matter protests.
Facebook and other social media companies have made some changes to dismantle misinformation and hate on their services. Last month, Twitter announced that it would remove thousands of accounts associated with the fringe conspiracy movement QAnon, saying their messages could lead to harm and violated Twitter policy. In June, Facebook took down a network of accounts tied to boogaloo, an antigovernment movement in the United States that encourages violence. That same month, YouTube banned six channels for violating its policies, including those of two prominent white supremacists, David Duke and Richard Spencer.
But according to the attorneys general, Facebook in particular has not done enough. The officials pointed to Facebook’s recent Civil Rights Audit — which found that advertisers could still run ads that painted a religious group as a threat to the “American way of life” — as evidence that the social network had fallen short.
“Facebook has a hate speech, discrimination, disinformation problem,” Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, of New Jersey, who led the letter, said in an interview. “The way I view it, as an attorney general, is that it directly affects public safety in my state, that the groups that are allowed to find community online, on Facebook, allow hate to be normalized.”
Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University and the author of “Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,” said she was “grateful to see these A.G.s step forward and demand that Facebook do better.”
Facebook needs “far more sunshine and oversight,” Professor Citron said. “They need to enforce their hate speech policies fairly including against white supremacists, and they need to audit their algorithms to curtail their optimization for extremism.”
Daniel Roberts, a spokesman for Facebook, said in a statement that the company was investing billions of dollars to combat hate speech and misinformation. “We share the Attorneys General’s goal of ensuring people feel safe on the internet and look forward to continuing our work with them,” he said.
The attorneys general asked that Facebook more aggressively enforce its existing policies against hate; allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement; commit to an independent analysis of the social network’s content and algorithms; and expand policies limiting inflammatory ads that could vilify minority groups.
They also called on Facebook to provide supportive services for people harassed on its services. According to a 2017 survey from the Pew Research Center, more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and of those, more than three-quarters reported being harassed on Facebook.
The attorneys general said that the company’s response has been too slow or weak when people flagged harassment. The officials said that the social network should provide immediate assistance.
Mr. Grewal said the letter was inspired in part by Facebook’s delay in removing a local page, Rise Up Ocean County, that appeared to stoke anti-Semitic rhetoric on the social network. Mr. Grewal said it took 10 months for Facebook to completely take it down — after violent attacks against Jews in Jersey City, N.J., in December.
Mr. Grewal said the state attorneys general expected Facebook to react much faster to the letter. “We won’t be stopped,” he said.
And if there were to be another delay, he said, “we always have a variety of legal tools at our disposal.”

I got my first Spider-Man suit in 2013, and have been doing Spider-Man cosplay since Easter of 2014. I'd come out of the hospital the week before and on Easter Day, I put on my suit and went to Times Square to entertain kids.
In the process of trying to find a Spider-Man suit that was more cinematic, I stumbled upon the cosplay scene. After a bit of research I discovered how to modify some of my suits to look more detailed, which also made me feel more confident when I wore them out in public places.
I then started reading more on Spider-Man himself. I'd always liked him as a kid, but as a kid all you understand is that he's a hero who fights bad guys. However, as you get older you start to understand the character more, and I felt like it was me. He's an everyday New Yorker; trying to make it, struggling to pay rent, taking things one day at a time, and putting other people before himself.
In reality Spider-Man only has a handful of super powers, he can stick to most surfaces, he has spider a sense, superhuman strength and speed just to name few. Aside from that, he's just a regular New Yorker—with genius intellect. But I feel like he resonates with a lot of people.
I was out there at the protests in New York before I climbed on Manhattan Bridge—both in and out of Spider-Man cosplay actually. The whole Black Lives Matter movement is a really big thing, because there's so much injustice towards people of colour.
Again, as you get older and more mature, you come to realize how important these things are. As a black man in New York City, in America, in this world; you realize how important your voice is, and how important it is for you to be there during these times. I felt I had to be there, being a black person and genuinely wanting a change. We need it, and hopefully better days will come sooner rather than later, because black people deserve it.
I want people to understand that we're not saying that all lives don't matter—because we understand that all life is important. But we want people to understand that black lives matter too. And the injustice is not fair.
When I first saw the images of George Floyd's death, I didn't think it was real. Then I heard about the video. I told my friends I couldn't watch that video, because I'm too sensitive and I knew it would anger me. So I didn't watch the video for maybe three days. When I did, it broke my heart because it makes you wonder how many weren't recorded, that we don't know about. To sit and watch a video where four police officers watch a man die, when they took an oath to serve and protect the people, it's heartbreaking. A lot of us feel like if he wasn't black, that wouldn't have happened.
People are frustrated and angry. All this could have been avoided if they had initially arrested those four officers. But now we have riots and protests and looting, and a lot of people have been hurt. I've protested for maybe a week and a half, in and out of cosplay. Usually I go to work, and straight after I go to protest, and normally during my last hour of being there I go home and change in a Spider-Man suit.
A lot of people have been happy to see Spider-man at the protests—it's like a breath of fresh air to them. Quite a few adults have reached out to me and told me that seeing Spider-Man at the protests made them emotional. People have also told me that when their children saw Spider-Man at the protests they said ""he's real!"" and the parents told them that Spider-Man was standing up for a very important cause. Furthermore, It's definitely a boost of morale for the crowd and everyone who is there.
I climbed the Manhattan Bridge on June 2, the first day they enforced the 8pm curfew in New York. We were marching across the bridge and some people started to worry about the curfew. As we were crossing the bridge, the 8pm curfew came into effect. So we were all standing there, at the end of the Manhattan bridge chanting,""let us through!""
There was one guy in the crowd who was saying he was ready for a riot. However, we wanted to keep it peaceful, we just wanted to be heard and make it home safely. This Spider-Man is 5ft 10inches and it was a big crowd. So I decided I was going to climb a part of the bridge and take the high ground.
I saw a little ledge, and it was really hard to climb because I was wearing spandex. I got a grip on the ledge, and I thought I would shimmy up backwards. After I successfully got up there, I sat on the edge with my Black Lives Matter sign. There was one guy who quoted from the 2002 Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie; ""If you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"". Scaling that part of the bridge boosted morale and it lightened the mood in one of the darkest hours. It definitely took the energy to a more positive space.
On June 8, I was in Brooklyn, protesting again in my Spider-Man suit. This time as Miles Morales. I stood on top of my friend's car, with my fist up and Tupac's Changes playing in the background. I saw a guy come by me with a sign that said, ""Black Trans Live Matter."" I held it up to the crowd to show them that the black LGTBQ community needs and has our support as well. The Black Lives Matter movement relates to the LGTBQ community as well, many times they are left out of the conversation. You can't say you're for the Black Lives Matter movement but be homophobic or transphobic.
The black LGTBQ community faces just as much injustice. Thus, seeing Spider-Man with that sign probably came as a shock, it was like ""he's on our side, there's no discrimination here."" I think it said to people that whether you're male, female, gay, heterosexual, transgender it doesn't matter. You have a hero on your side.
The main thing now is getting people to truly and genuinely understand that Black Lives Matter, and that we want a change. I'm happy that small steps are being made, but it's heartbreaking that it took all this to happen for change to come. It's not going to happen overnight unfortunately, but people are starting to take notice and starting to make the right efforts to make the change. I did see that Governor Andrew Cuomo wants a bill passed that makes it a hate crime to call 911 and make a false accusation citing race, religion or gender. That lets us know that they're hearing our voices, that the protesting is working.
Even though I cosplay and suit up as Spider-Man at the protests, I am a proud black man. When I put on my Spider-Man uniform, it's not to be a distraction, don't take it as me hiding my skin or being afraid because that's not true. I want people to understand that Spider-Man is a symbol of hope and peace—and people resonate with that.
I hope that people understand racism and injustice will no longer be tolerated. The world is finally realizing what black people have been experiencing for years and what we've been fighting for. At the end of the day, my skin is not a sin. It's time for unity and equality. So don't be afraid to show your support. Black Lives Matter.

Twenty state attorneys general on Wednesday called on Facebook to better prevent messages of hate, bias and disinformation from spreading, and said the company needed to provide more help to users facing online abuse. 
 In a letter to the social media giant, the officials said they regularly encountered people facing online intimidation and harassment on Facebook. They outlined seven steps the company should take, including allowing third-party audits of hate content and offering real-time assistance to users.
 ''We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do,'' said the letter, which was addressed to Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. The officials who signed the letter, all of them Democrats, represent states including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, as well as the District of Columbia.
 The letter adds to the rising pressure facing Mr. Zuckerberg and his company to stop disinformation and harassment on Facebook. Civil rights leaders, advertisers and some of the company's own employees have criticized Facebook for failing to curtail the spread of noxious content. Extremists and conspiracists have turned to social media -- most often Facebook, Twitter and YouTube -- to circulate falsehoods about the coronavirus pandemic, the coming presidential election and Black Lives Matter protests.
 Facebook and other social media companies have made some changes to dismantle misinformation and hate on their services. Last month, Twitter announced that it would remove thousands of accounts associated with the fringe conspiracy movement QAnon, saying their messages could lead to harm and violated Twitter policy. In June, Facebook took down a network of accounts tied to boogaloo, an antigovernment movement in the United States that encourages violence. That same month, YouTube banned six channels for violating its policies, including those of two prominent white supremacists, David Duke and Richard Spencer.
 But according to the attorneys general, Facebook in particular has not done enough. The officials pointed to Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit -- which found that advertisers could still run ads that painted a religious group as a threat to the ''American way of life'' -- as evidence that the social network had fallen short.
 ''Facebook has a hate speech, discrimination, disinformation problem,'' Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, of New Jersey, who led the letter, said in an interview. ''The way I view it, as an attorney general, is that it directly affects public safety in my state, that the groups that are allowed to find community online, on Facebook, allow hate to be normalized.''
 Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at Boston University and the author of ''Hate Crimes in Cyberspace,'' said she was ''grateful to see these A.G.s step forward and demand that Facebook do better.''
 Facebook needs ''far more sunshine and oversight,'' Professor Citron said. ''They need to enforce their hate speech policies fairly including against white supremacists, and they need to audit their algorithms to curtail their optimization for extremism.''
 Daniel Roberts, a spokesman for Facebook, said in a statement that the company was investing billions of dollars to combat hate speech and misinformation. ''We share the Attorneys General's goal of ensuring people feel safe on the internet and look forward to continuing our work with them,'' he said.
 The attorneys general asked that Facebook more aggressively enforce its existing policies against hate; allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement; commit to an independent analysis of the social network's content and algorithms; and expand policies limiting inflammatory ads that could vilify minority groups.
 They also called on Facebook to provide supportive services for people harassed on its services. According to a 2017 survey from the Pew Research Center, more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and of those, more than three-quarters reported being harassed on Facebook.
 The attorneys general said that the company's response has been too slow or weak when people flagged harassment. The officials said that the social network should provide immediate assistance.
 Mr. Grewal said the letter was inspired in part by Facebook's delay in removing a local page, Rise Up Ocean County, that appeared to stoke anti-Semitic rhetoric on the social network. Mr. Grewal said it took 10 months for Facebook to completely take it down -- after violent attacks against Jews in Jersey City, N.J., in December.
 Mr. Grewal said the state attorneys general expected Facebook to react much faster to the letter. ''We won't be stopped,'' he said.
 And if there were to be another delay, he said, ''we always have a variety of legal tools at our disposal.''

Recently a case has been observed where the family of a Sikh grandfather who was fatally stabbed in a park last year held a vigil in that same park Wednesday, nearly a week after a judge ordered the release of the man who was charged with his murder.
The accused was identified as Anthony Kreiter-Rhoads, had been held without bail since he was arrested and charged with the killing of Parmjit Singh, 64, who was stabbed in the throat while walking in Gretchen Talley Park last year.
Judge Michael Mulvihill of the San Joaquin County Superior Court ruled on Oct. 1 that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a case against Kreiter-Rhoads, 22, citing lack of probable cause and lack of motive.
The San Joaquin County district attorneys office did not return a request for comment Thursday.
Singhs wife, daughter and other family members held a candlelight vigil at the park Wednesday to demand justice and protest the dismissal of charges against Kreiter-Rhoads.
Singh was on a walk when he was attacked the evening of August 25, 2019. His assailant cut his throat and he bled to death before emergency assistance arrived.
The homicide was one of several attacks on Sikh men in Northern California communities in recent years. It came one month after the July 2019 assault on a Sikh priest in the Modesto suburb of Hughson (Stanislaus County).
Observant male Sikhs wear turbans to cover their hair, which they refrain from cutting, in accordance with their religious teachings. Sikhas are sometimes mistaken for Muslims and have been the frequent targets of hate crimes in the two decades since September 11, according to a ProPublica report.
United Sikhs, a New York-based non-profit, condemned the release of Kreiter-Rhoads on Wednesday and demanded that the U.S. Department of Justice investigate whether the murder was motivated by racial and religious hate.
United Sikhs spokesman Jasmit Singh said that all of the indications of a possible race and or religious hate motive are present in this case. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

NEARLY TWO decades after 9/11 shook the United States and a resultant 'mistaken identity' crisis led to a spurt in hate crimes against Sikhs, Fauja Singh, a beloved member of the community and the world's oldest marathoner, has been featured as a superhero in a children's book authored by an American professor.
The book 'Fauja Singh Keeps Going - A true story of the oldest person to ever run a marathon', narrates the story of the 109-year-old, who became the world's oldest runner to complete a marathon in 2011 at age of 100. Complete with illustrations, it aims to tell children the inspirational story of a Sikh boy in a village of Punjab, who only started running at the age of 81, as he was born with weak legs that wouldn't even allow him to play cricket and run with his friends. His parents would worry that he might never be able to walk. But he never stopped trying. He worked harder, strengthened his body and mind. Eventually, he went on to complete a marathon at age of 100 from then on, broke several other records.
Authored by New York-based professor Simran Jeet Singh (36), the book also featured among the 'bestsellers' on Amazon after its release on August 25.
Fauja Singh, who currently stays at his native village Beas Pind in Jalandhar, Punjab, has also written a foreword for the book.
He writes: ""All my life, people set limitations on me. They said I would never walk...They certainly never thought I would set records with my running. No matter what people said, I always believed in myself...I never gave up. And I always held on to hope...The boy they teased for not being able to walk became the oldest person to ever run a marathon. I was the first 100-year-old to ever run 26.2 miles. Doctors couldn't figure out why I had trouble walking as a child, nor could they figure out why I was able to begin walking and, eventually, running. I think of it as a reminder that all of our bodies are different - and so are our experiences with disabilities...My secret to a long and healthy life has been taking care of my mind, body, and soul. Everyday, I challenge myself to think, exercise, eat healthy, and pray...'
The book, which includes beautiful illustrations by Baljinder Kaur, traces the journey of young Fauja from Punjab to the UK. It describes how young Fauja, whose name meant 'warrior lion', wanted to feel stronger but his parents worried that he might not even be able to walk. But his mother kept motivating him and he never stopped trying. It was only after his fifth birthday that a miracle happened and he started taking steps, and his family was so elated that they distributed prasad in the village and went to a gurdwara for special prayers. But his legs were still very weak and children started teasing him and calling him 'danda' (stick). When it was time for him to go to school, but there was no transport, his legs were not strong enough for him to walk all the way. So he started farming with his father and would study at home. But by the time he turned 15, he could walk a mile, as the entire village watched, bewildered.
It was time for him to accept another challenge in his life and at age of 81, he moved to England with his family. He felt like a stranger in a country he never knew, as everyone would speak English and he had no friends. One day he put on his shoes and started running, and then there was no looking back. The winds flowed through his beard and for the first time, he had a smile on his face after coming to the UK. Eventually, he underwent professional training, and became the world's oldest marathoner and ran the Toronto Waterfront Marathon at 100 on October 16, 2011.
Speaking to The Indian Express over phone, author Simran Jeet Singh, a professor in religion, culture and history at the Union Theological Seminary, New York, said, ""Growing up in the US in a Sikh family, we always used to wonder why there were no storybooks or children's books with turbaned superheroes? I used to ask my parents why there can't be any superheroes that look like me! Especially after 9/11 attacks, the Sikh community in the US has faced a lot and continues to do so. There were racial and hate crimes as they were mistook as terrorists. It was so important to introduce a superhero from my community and tell children that there can be superheroes who wear turban and have beards. To wean away hate crimes against Sikhs in the US, it is important to start from the children because they should know who Sikhs are and how they look. This book is more important for children of native Americans so they do not grow up inculcating hate or any doubts about Sikhs in their minds. After its release, the book has been a bestseller on Amazon and we are also distributing copies in the schools. We will also provide books in India..."" Harjinder Singh Kukreja, a Ludhiana-based restauranteur, said, ""After 9/11, Sikhs continue to struggle of how little
Americans know of Sikhism. Nineteen years after 9/11, we are still mistaken as terrorists and hate crimes against Sikhs in the US still continue. A book introducing a Sikh hero to the children in the US will tell young minds who are Sikhs, how they look, what a turban means and that Sikhs are not terrorists..."""

Earlier today, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced the ""Say Their Name"" reform agenda following the murder of George Floyd and an ongoing pattern of police brutality against minority communities across the nation. The Governor said he will work with the State Legislature to get these policies done next week.
The list of policy priorities builds on earlier proposals he called for in the immediate aftermath of the killing of George Floyd and prior executive actions he has taken including appointing the Attorney General as a special prosecutor in matters relating to the deaths of unarmed civilians caused by law enforcement.
The 'Say Their Name' Reform agenda includes:
* Allow for transparency of prior disciplinary records of law enforcement officers by reforming 50-a of the civil rights law;
* Banning chokeholds by law enforcement officers;
* Prohibiting false race-based 911 reports and making them a crime; and
* Designating the Attorney General as an independent prosecutor for matters relating to the deaths of unarmed civilians caused by law enforcement.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:
Good morning. Thank you for being here. To my right, is Major West, New York State Police. To my left, Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor. to her left, Robert Mujica, budget director. It was another long and ugly night in the United states of America. Last night, as it was in New York State. Day 97 of the coronavirus crisis, day 12 of the civil unrest dealing with the aftermath of Mr. Floyd's murder. And this, my friends, is a dangerous combination, colliding crises compounding each other. But, our job is to address what is presented, and this is the reality that is presented, and this is what we will deal with.
On the coronavirus situation, there's a lot to learn from what we just went through, and I believe it's a transformative situation for society and something we can really learn from going forward. Coronavirus was a medical issue, was a public health issue, was an economic issue, but more than anything it was a social issue. It was about how people behave, right. And to address coronavirus what we really had to do was change society. It was not a government operation. It was not something I could do governmentally. People had to do it. Government could provide leadership, and we had an operational component, but it was about people making the changes that had to be made. They had to accept it, they had to understand it, they had to change their behavior. That is a monumental undertaking, always.
Social change? When does social change happen? Social change happens when people are presented with the facts, they understand the facts, they believe the facts, there's a plan forward based on the facts, and people care enough to make a difference. With coronavirus, I sat up here every day and I said, here are the facts, here are the number of deaths, here are the hospitalizations, this is what we're looking for, here's a plan that I think can take us forward. Based on those facts, people were motivated because it was about life and death, and about their life and death, and about their family's life and a death, and we went forward. Compare the coronavirus situation to the situation we're in with the social unrest we see, people have seen Mr. Floyd's murder. They're watching what's going on, on the streets, every day, and they're saying enough is enough. And it's what they are seeing and what they know that is disturbing. We are going to show you again, for those of you who haven't seen, a scene from Buffalo and a scene from New York City because this is a story all across the state.
[Shows videos]
This is Buffalo, New York yesterday. I just spoke with Mr. Gugino on the phone who is that gentleman, who - thankfully - is alive. You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity. Why? Why? Why was that necessary? Where is the threat? Older gentleman and where was the threat? Then you just walk by the person while you see blood coming from his head. Police officers walked by. It's just fundamentally offensive and frightening. It's just frightening. You say, ""Who are we? How did we get to this place?""
Incidents of pushing the press. You have incidents of police getting hit with bricks in the head. You say where are we? Who are we? These are undeniable situations. Buffalo situation, I want to applaud Mayor Byron Brown, Mayor of Buffalo. He suspended the police officers yesterday, immediately and I believe the District Attorney is looking into it from a possible criminal liability point of view. I applaud the District Attorney for moving quickly. People see this, they see the facts. Now, when you have all this emotion you have to focus on the facts and the intelligence of the matter. It can't be about emotion. Of course, police must protect the public safety and police must protect themselves. That's a fact.
Of course, there are also cases of police abuse and the abuse of power. That's a fact. You can have two coincident facts. Mr. Floyd's murder was the breaking point of a long list of deaths that were unnecessary and which were abusive. That is a fact and people are saying, enough is enough. That is a fact. What people are saying is, we must change and we must stop the abuse - and that is a fact. And New York should be at the forefront of that. That has always been New York's legacy as the progressive capital. We are the ones who hold the standard of what is the right progressive reform and New York should pass next week what we call the ""Say Their Name"" Reform Agenda. Say Their Name Reform Agenda comes from the long list of names of people who we have seen who have been abused by police officers, by the criminal justice system, and Mr. Floyd is just the last name on a very long list. Fine. Enough is enough. Change the law, take the moment, reform.
There are four cornerstones for our ""Say Their Name"" Reform Agenda. One, transparency of prior disciplinary records of a police officer. If they're being charged and investigated for abuse their prior disciplinary record is relevant. And by the way, it's relevant one way or the other. If there were no other disciplinary proceedings, that can exonerate the person who is charged. If there are prior disciplinary proceedings for this type of behavior, then yes, it is evidentiary. But people should know. Chokeholds, we went through this with Eric Garner. Again, you saw with it Mr. Floyd's death. But we learned it first with Eric Garner and many, many other cases, by the way. Why? We've seen 911 calls which are race-based false calls. A false 911 call based on race should be classified as a hate crime in the State of New York. We know that it's wrong for the local district attorney to investigate the police force from that county. By executive order, I did the attorney general as an independent prosecutor. That should be codified in law. I did it five years ago. But these are the cornerstones of a real reform agenda that can address what is going on on the street.
Reform works for everyone's interests here. Stopping police abuse vindicates the overwhelming majority, 99.9 percent of police who are there to do the right thing and do the right thing every day. It restores the confidence, the respect, and the trust that you need to make this relationship work. You have to heal the police-community relationship. That has to happen for the sake of the police and for the sake of the community. You look at this looting that's been going on in New York City. This hurts poor communities and distressed communities. You saw many businesses destroyed that are relied upon by that community. You can't have the relationship that works one way or the other. And even in this politically partisan racially charged environment, there is still a truth, and there is still facts, and that's what we have to focus on. That was the truth with the coronavirus. Even though it was all political and everything was partisan, and Democrat, Republican, and red and blue, it was never -- they offer us false choices.
COVID, coronavirus, well, do you want to save people's lives or reopen the economy? And you should reopen the economy and forget public health. Or you should take care of people's health, but not reopen the economy. It was never either or. It can't be either or. I know from a hyperbolic rhetorical partisan, it's one or the other, liberate New York, worry about health, close New York. It was never one or the other. That was unintelligent. It was always both.
It's the same situation here. It's not a question of public safety or civil rights. Whose side are you on, public safety or civil rights? It can't be either or. It can't be police safety or prosecutor safety. Pick a side, which are you on? Red or blue? Democrat or Republican? Who are you with? You have to be with both. Yes, you need public safety, and yes, you need civil rights. Yes, you need police to be safe. And yes, you need the protesters to be safe. These are false choices. We need both. Even in this hysterical moment, you need to be able to hold two truths in your hands at the same time. How do we change society to make these reforms happen? How do you have a new societal awareness? Can you do that? Can you change behavior to respect one another?
You're darn right you can. We know we can because we just did it through this coronavirus in a very fundamental way. You changed people's fundamental behavior, whether or not they leave the house, whether or not they go to school, whether or not they go to work, they changed themselves, remarkably fast and remarkably effective.
We have the lowest number of deaths from coronavirus that we have had since this started. 42 deaths, the lowest number since we started. Eight weeks ago, we had 800. Eight weeks. 800 people die to 42 people die in eight weeks. Amazing. How did you do that? I did nothing. The people of the state radically changed how they behaved. Look at that progress. Lowest number of hospitalizations to date, in a matter of weeks. So we know we can change, and we know we can change dramatically. People are focused, we have a plan, and that's when social reform happens, when people are motivated and people are focused. That was the Civil Rights Act nationally, that was the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, which changed labor rights in this nation, that was the environmental movement after Storm King, that's was the revolution of LGBTQ rights after Stonewall, that's what we just saw in coronavirus, which will go down in history as one of the great transformational moments of society, and this is a moment to lead in terms of social change. And we will do it because we are New York tough, smart, united, disciplined, loving, and that is what the moment requires. Thank you.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:
Good morning, happy Sunday. Budget Director Robert Mujica to my right. Secretary to the Governor Melissa DeRosa to my left. I'm going to speak a little quickly today for some reasons. Number one is because I am a New Yorker and we speak a little quickly. Number two because I promised my daughter Cara I would get home and we would have lunch before she goes to New York City because New York City reopens tomorrow.
Today is day 99 of the COVID crisis. Day 14 of the unrest after the murder of George Floyd, two separate issues. Two separate issues and we are working on both and we will talk about both of them on the reopening. Tomorrow we are going to have a big day with the reopening of New York City. Also, this week we will be taking up a reform agenda in the wake of the George Floyd murder. We will talk about both. Let me speak about the reform agenda first.
We had continued protest across the state last night. For the most part they were peaceful. The protesters all across the state, all across the nation, are basically saying the same thing. There is an anger, there is a frustration, there is a spirit of activism because people want change, and there should be change. And I said from day one that I figuratively stand with the protesters and this is about making change and action. Remember, ""Textbooks say that politicians lead and the people follow. No, it is often the people who lead and the politicians who follow."" A.J. Parkinson, more wisdom from A.J. Parkinson. Frederick Douglass, ""If there is no struggle, there is no progress."" And it is an opportunity for New York State to lead and that's what we do. That's what we did with marriage equality, with minimum wage, with gun safety, with free college tuition, and passing a reform agenda for criminal justice. 50-a, we have talked about, no chokeholds, the Attorney General as a special prosecutor, hate crimes for false 911 reports.
My opinion is the George Floyd reform agenda and what the protesters are trying to achieve, they should set the bar even higher and they should be bolder and they should demand federal reform. You want to change this country that has to happen on the national level. We are in the midst of the national elections and they should put forth a federal agenda that gets to the root cause of the issues. Yes, criminal justice reform, and we know how to do that. But the core inequality and injustice issues, start with the education system, where you have one education system in this country - one for the rich and one for the poor and everybody knows it. In this state, the most progressive state in the United States, a rich school spends $36,000 per student and the poor schools are $13,000 per student. From birth, and from day one of school, depending on the zip code you live in, depending on the income of your family, is the education you get. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's wrong. That has to happen at a federal level. How do you still have children growing up in poverty in this country, the richest country on the globe? It has to change. It can change. Look at the money the government found when they had to battle COVID. You can be creative when you have to - get creative about children living in poverty. And you need a real affordable housing agenda. The federal government, historically, constitutionally, by law provided affordable housing. The Housing Act said safe, clean, decent housing for every American. That was the 1949 Housing Act, paraphrased. The federal government went out of the business, states and locals were supposed to make up. You can't. You had a bevy of federal housing programs, Section 8 programs, voucher programs, building new public housing. If you want to make change in this moment, go to the court issue that is driving the injustice and the equality and get it done. You have this energy and the momentum and now is the time.
In terms of reopening, we have been doing it based on the data and the facts. The number of hospitalizations are down and the number of deaths are up slightly. But overall, the trajectory is down and today is Sunday, and the Sunday numbers tend to be statistically -- there is a variation with the rest of the week. But overall, the numbers are down and the numbers are good. Number of lives lost continues to drop.
We are now doing a tremendous number of tests. As I said, testing is the best mechanism to get a snapshot, right. Where are we today? You test today, and you find out where you are today, right. What is my weight today? You get on a scale and it gets you a number, that's where you are today. We do more testing than any state in the United States. We do more testing than any country per capita on the globe. So, we have the clearest definition of a snapshot. Yesterday, 60,000 tests performed in the State of New York, Saturday. 781 positive tests. Lowest since March 16, okay, which was before we even closed down. About 1 percent positive. That's where we are today. That is very, very good news, okay?
And we said the reopening is calibrated to the metrics in the data. If that's where we are, that's good news, it means the plan is working, it means that we bent the curve, and on those numbers, we can advance the reopening. Hudson Valley is on track for Phase 2 on Tuesday. Long Island is on track for Phase 2 on Wednesday. We're going to allow socially distanced graduations outdoors with up to 150 people total beginning June 26th. That's when the schools start to graduate, high schools, and it gives us a couple of weeks between now and then, God forbid the number changes. But, schools need to plan with the progress we've made so far, and if we continue this trajectory, we'll be able to do that. But again, we have a little time to see between now and then. In terms of New York City, New York city has met all the metrics. We are going to open New York City for Phase 1 tomorrow, period. That will happen. When we begin Phase 1 in New York City, remember that New York City had the highest number of cases. New York City has the highest density. New York City has also been the location for the protests with the most number of people. We are concerned that those protests may have increased the spread of the virus. We are going to do 35,000 tests per day, just in New York City. Snapshot, snapshot, snapshot. We will watch it on a daily basis to find out exactly what is happening.
Remember there was a lag on the infection rate. If you were to protest several days ago, it probably would not show up but when you get through about seven days, you will start to see a pop in the number if those protests actually increased to the spread. We are going to increase the number of testing sites in New York and I am going to ask, again, if you were at a protest, I understand your point and I'm with you. We also have this situation with the coronavirus. Act responsibly. Get a test. Get a test. We are going to open 15 sites that are dedicated just to protesters to get a test so you can get it on an expeditious basis. But please get a test. My opinion and not a fact - I would act as if you were exposed and I would tell people who I'm interacting with, assume I am positive for the virus because you could be infecting other people. But please get that test. That is the one variable in this equation that we are not sure of. We have tested everything else. We have measured everything else and everything was going fine and then we had this large number of protests. We don't know what the effect of those protests are and we are concerned about it. All of the health experts I have spoken to are concerned about it. So while we are waiting to see if there is any result get a test in the meantime.
But New Yorkers have bent the curve by being smart and there are always voices out there who say, everything is fine, I can't see the virus. A person said that to me on the street, ""Look around, do you see the virus?"" Yeah, no. You're not going to see the virus, but you have these voices that say everything is fine, disobey the rules, just open. Look, there are still facts in life. Everybody can have an opinion and then there are still facts. I believe my ideology is government doesn't have a right to tell me to do this. I understand your ideology. Let's look at facts. Look at what is happening around the country. Look at the facts after countries and states reopen and look at what is happening with their curve.
Arizona is seeing an increase in their numbers. South Carolina, new record with more than 500 in a single day. Hot spots across the South and in California as Northeast slows - that's us. California posted highest number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday. Florida 1,000 for the fourth day in a row. U.S. 1.8 million spread rises with turmoil. These are facts. This can happen. This can happen. We know it can happen because it happened here. We've made all this progress. Please, please - I know it's been 90 days - please, stay disciplined, stay smart because it is working. We've come a long way and a lot of people have suffered to get here and a lot of people have died. Let's not be foolish now.
Again, look at what we did. Flatten the curve - forget flatten the curve. I'm going to change the state signs. We bent the curve. We bent the curve. We intended to flatten to get to a plateau, we bent it. Look at the rest of the country. We are curve benders - if there is such a thing. New Yorkers should be proud of their accomplishment. In light of that, we are going to light the landmarks across the state in blue and gold in honor of our New Yorkers, our New York Tough New Yorkers. This is going to be in Manhattan, which is very cool. New York Tough. The Mario Cuomo Bridge, the education building, that's the Corning Tower in the left. These will be the landmarks that will be lit blue and gold to celebrate our accomplishment, because it was an extraordinary accomplishment, because we are New York tough, smart, united, disciplined and loving.

24,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","CE Noticias Financieras English",2020-09-18,"1052 words",NA,NA,NA,"Now Donald Trump's administration goes for opposition protesters",FALSE,"In a private call with federal prosecutors across the country, the message of Attorney General (Donald Trump's Justice Minister) William Barr was clear: aggressively going after protesters causing violence.
Barr pressured his prosecutors to file federal charges whenever they can, keeping control of cases, even if a defendant could be tried instead, in a state court, according to officials with knowledge of last week's call, and who spoke to the Associated Press as an anonymity.
Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences.
The Trump administration's crackdown already carries more than 300 federal crime arrests in protests that erupt after George Floyd's death.
An AP analysis of the data shows that while many are accused of violent crimes such as fires, caused by throwing Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault and for hurting law enforcement, others are not, something that provokes criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to block demonstrations.
""The speed at which all this moves from state court to federal court is impressive and incredible,"" said Charles Sunwabe, who represents a man from Erie, Pennsylvania, accused of lighting fire in a coffee shop, after a protest on May 30.
 ""It's an attempt to intimidate these protesters and silence them,"" he said.
 Some cases are considered false and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, like that of a teenager accused of online civil disorder.
The Trump administration took advantage of the demonstrations and the aggressive federal response to show what the president says is his law enforcement prowess, claiming he is countering the rise in crime in Democratic-led cities.
Trump mocked the protesters and increased violence around the protests, although most are peaceful.
 Indeed, pockets of violence arose in cities across the country, including Portland, Oregon, where protests turned into clashes with law enforcement for weeks. There were nights of looting and other riots in other cities, such as Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Louisville, Washington and Chicago.
Federal officials were also called to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after major protests and riots following Jacob Blake's shooting and shooting murder of two protesters, and the subsequent arrest of a 17-year-old.
It should be noted that this teenager was not charged with any federal crime. Nor was a man accused of shooting and killing a protester in Louisville after Breonna Taylor's death.
While Barr has pursued violence related to protests directed at law enforcement, he argued that there is rarely any reason to open thorough investigations into police department practices.
However, the Department of Justice opened a series of civil rights investigations in individual cases.
Barr said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, although blacks are disproportionately more likely to be killed by the police, and public attitudes about police reforms have changed.
 Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Department of Justice for decades, particularly for cases of violent crime andgangs, where criminals could face much harsher federal penalties and there is no parole.
The Leg of Federal Justice
 Police chiefs in several cities noted the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors in bringing charges that can result in prolonged prison sentences to reduce violent crime.
Even before the riots earlier this year, the Department of Justice was intervening to press charges in states where the government believes justice is not fully sought by local prosecutors.
In January, for example, the department filed federal hate crimes charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women, inone of several seemingly anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.
 It is unclear whether the arrests related to the protests will continue at a good pace. Demonstrations decreased, though not necessarily on federal charges. Fires in the west and hurricanes in the south cushioned some of the conflict.
 Although many local prosecutors dismissed dozens of arrests for low-level protests, some continue to go down strongly. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for a dozen people at a protest that followed the death of a man with a knife by police.
Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, called for the Justice Department to prosecute federal charges against violent protesters, accusing the Trump administration of refusing to prosecute troublemakers.
 About a third of federal protest-related cases are in Portland,for crimes such as assaulting an assistant U.S. Marshal with a baseball bat, causing fires and detonating explosives at the federal courthouse, and throwing stones at officers.
 A man from El Paso, Texas was accused of promoting hate speech, posting an online video with a racist epithet, and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was accused of helping set fire to a police station there, after Floyd's death.
 But other cases simply don't belong in federal court, lawyers say.
 In Seattle, 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, accused of setting the front of a police station on fire, faces a minimum of five years in prison if convicted of arson in federal court. It could be about a year behind bars in state court, where the case belongs, his lawyer said.
 ""This is a city property that was destroyed and there is a local prosecution office that is ready and willing, and is able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is trying to emphasize these crimes related to protests about some agenda they are looking for,"" said assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll.
 Carroll accused federal authorities of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disturbing than they actually were.
 ""There's absolutely an agenda here to get this out of proportion, make it look more serious or more sinister than it is,"" attorney Marcus Barnett said of the prosecution of federal charges. ""This is the Department of Justice, from the beginning, promoting an agenda that has nothing to do with justice,"" he said.

Sobel",NA,"Too many American Jews are turning a blind eye to Antisemitism",FALSE,"No Jewish organization in the USA (exceot the ZOA) has the fortitude to publicly confront egregious acts of antisemitism. Opinion.
To say the United States is living through a daunting, unique period of time might indeed be an understatement. Unfortunately, what""s not unique and remains a constant is the pervasive antisemitism throughout certain sectors of the country and the complicity of many Jewish organizations themselves in this blight. 
With all the burning, looting, and rioting going &#111n in American cities, has anyone heard any uproar over the wide scale destruction of Jewish institutions in Los Angeles, this past May? If the answer is no, neither have I. Along with Synagogues, numerous Jewish-owned buildings and stores were defaced and in some cases torched. Many were desecrated with anti-Semitic graffiti, too graphic to repeat. 
According to Paul Koretz, Fairfax district Councilman, he ""watched the fires, looting, and antisemitic hate crimes and incidents. Under the guise of protests, some advanced their antisemitic agenda."" 
He went &#111n to say: 
""Across the street from Beth El, the Kosher Mensch Bakery and Kitchen and the Jewish-owned clothing store Go Couture were destroyed. Stores &#111n the fashionable Melrose Avenue, were also damaged, as were multiple Jewish institutions in the area: Congregation Beth Israel, Congregation Tivereth Avi/Morasha Educational Centre, Shaarei Tefilah Synagogue, and the Shalhevet school for girls."" 
Jonathan Friedman, the owner of Syd""s Pharmacy, stood with his friends helplessly and watched a mob break into his pharmacy &#111n Beverly Blvd. Friedman stated, ""They stole all the narcotics..."" 
Jonathan Friedman, the owner of Syd""s Pharmacy, stood with his friends helplessly and watched a mob break into his pharmacy &#111n Beverly Blvd. As reported in forward.com, Friedman stated, ""They stole all the narcotics and damaged the floors and entrance. I estimate the damage is over $100,000."" Absurdly, some would have you believe they were just memorializing George Floyd. 
Marnina Wirtschafter, a 26 year old, Jewish resident of Los Angeles, was likewise outraged at a June 2nd rally. She felt it was her duty ""to show up for others because ""it""s the Jewish thing to do."" Shamefully, she wasn't referring to the aforementioned, antisemitic, pogrom. 
Instead both she and another Jewish woman, Kelsey Goldberg, were at a Black Lives Matter march where Wirtshafter further pontificated: ""We need to continue to read and uplift black voices. We need to let them know and let your own community know that you are no longer willing to be complacent in racism."" Goldberg, 31, chimed in that she has attended many Black Lives Matter protests and has been involved with social justice activism for several years, attending many such marches. It begs the question, why these young women weren't as outraged over the injustices their fellow Jews had just suffered by the very group they were marching with? Aren""t Jews living in their own town also entitled to social justice and legal justice as well? 
Chutzpah layered &#111n top of chutzpah. Morton Klein the President of the National ZOA had the audacity to answer those very questions, pointing out in tweets what should have been obvious to all: ""BlackLivesMatter is an anti-Semitic, Israel hating, Soros funded, racist, Israelophobic hate group."" He followed up with: ""I urge the SPLC (Southern Poverty Law Center) to immediately put BlackLivesMatter &#111n their list of hate groups. BLM is a Jew hating, White hating, Israel hating, conservative Black hating, violence promoting, dangerous Soros funded extremist group of haters."" 
For expressing what &#111nly the willfully blind could deny, Klein was subjected to his sworn enemies giving voice to an anguished outcry of hate Vociferously, he was denounced as a ""racist,"" ""bigot,"" and xenophobe. 
If you think the recriminations were coming from BLM, you""re sadly mistaken. Sixteen of the fifty &#111ne member organizations of the Conference of Presidents issued a separate letter &#111n June 12th condemning Klein""s comments, and called for the removal of the ZOA from the Council of Presidents. 
Unsurprisingly, not &#111ne word about the antisemitic riots just days earlier was mentioned by any of Klein""s sixteen disparaging groups. It""s not surprising because with the exception of the ZOA no other Jewish organization in the United States has the intestinal fortitude to publicly confront and maintain pressure &#111n egregious acts of antisemitism. 
This past December, a black man named Grafton Thomas crashed a Hannukah party at the house of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg in Monsey, New York. Brandishing a butcher knife, he immediately began stabbing five people, &#111ne of whom, Rabbi Josef Newmann, succumbed to his injuries. Investigators found handwritten journals expressing antisemitic views, including material about Adolf Hitler, ""Nazi culture"", and drawings of a Star of David and of a swastika among Thomas's possessions. 
With so much evidence of it being a hate crime and over a hundred guests at the party recognizing him as the assailant, you would think it was a slam dunk case. Guess again. This past April 20th, a federal judge ruled Grafton was incompetent to stand trial and ordered him to be hospitalized in a mental facility. He certainly was competent enough to research Nazi culture, cross state lines, seek out the Rabbi""s address, and commit murder, but not enough to stand trial. This dastardly event came &#111n the heels of a 30 year old Hassidic kollel student was stabbed multiple times &#111n his way to Synagogue in Ramapo, New York, two months earlier. 
There isn""t a person &#111n the planet that hasn""t heard of George Floyd, so why aren""t the names of Rabbi Newmann and that kollel student equally familiar? I think all unbiased, serious minded people know the answer to this question. 
With the exception of the ZOA, a sort of Stockholm syndrome has set in amongst Jewish leadership in and out of congress. They fail miserably confronting the present scourge of anti-Jewish violence, opting instead to support groups such as Black Lives Matter that inspire, and are complicit in the antisemitism we""re now witnessing. 
In an article published in, The Jewish News of Northern California, entitled: ""Over 400 Jewish Groups and Synagogues Sign a Letter Supporting Black Lives Matter."" The opening paragraph reads: ""More than 400 Jewish organizations and synagogues in the United States, including a number in Northern California, have signed &#111n to a letter that asserts ""unequivocally: Black Lives Matter. 
Not &#111ne word about the outrages committed against Jewish communities by members and supporters of this hateful group. Worse yet, far too many march in tandem with them. 
Jerold Sobel is the founder of the ZOA of Southwest Florida and has been its president for the past 10 years. He has a master""s degree in international relations from CCNY and resides in Naples, Florida.

(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Coronavirus 
More than 22 million people have been infected with coronavirus worldwide, and countries are getting their plans for a potential vaccine in place. Australia has secured a deal with drugmaker AstraZeneca for a potential Covid-19 vaccine that it will offer to all citizens for free. The first coronavirus vaccine trial in the US is moving along at a good clip, but more diverse sets of trial volunteers are needed if testing is going to succeed. Officials are ""very concerned"" that the low number of minorities in the trial may delay the drug from getting to the marketplace. Once it does, Dr. Anthony Fauci says there's not likely to be any vaccine mandate in the US anyway. Health officials say there is something you can do to be safe while waiting for a breakthrough: Get your flu shot.
2. Democratic National Convention
The second night of the DNC featured more influential names -- and more Republican allies -- throwing their support behind nominee Joe Biden. They included former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, ex-Secretary of State John Kerry, former President Bill Clinton and Cindy McCain. The most talked-about part of the evening? A virtual roll call vote in which states showcased their geographic and cultural diversity, and which featured influential figures in the fight for equal rights and progressive values. Alabama celebrated the legacy of the late Rep. John Lewis, and in Wyoming, the parents of Matthew Shepard, who was killed in 1998 because he was gay, brought a message of LGTBQ equality.
3. Postal Service
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has halted changes to the US Postal Service that critics claim are slowing down mail service ahead of November's election -- but that's not the end of the story. It's not clear whether some of the changes, like the removal of sorting machines, can be undone before election time, and at least 20 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against potential mail delays. Some are already feeling the consequences of the changes, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been forced to find other ways to ship mail-order prescriptions because of mail delays.
4. Russia investigation
The Senate Intelligence Committee has released the most comprehensive examination so far into how Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The report reveals the Trump campaign welcomed the foreign adversary's help, and contains new information about contacts between Russian officials and associates of President Trump during and after the campaign. The bipartisan report goes beyond the findings former special counsel Robert Mueller released last year because it wasn't limited by the questions of criminality that drove that probe. It also comes as the intelligence community warns that Russia is again seeking to interfere in the US election process.
5. Mali
The President of Mali, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, announced his resignation after he and the country's Prime Minister were reportedly arrested in a suspected coup. The upheaval, reportedly led by mutinous military leaders, follows months of anti-government mass protests and a rising insurgency from Islamist militants. Now, the West African nation is likely to face even more instability. Keita announced he has no choice but to step down, and the country's national assembly and government would now be dissolved. The military leaders of the coup promised the public a reasonable political transition and new elections. But for the near future, they have closed all land and sea borders and instituted a nationwide curfew.

Works by Nan Goldin, Ryan McGinley, Tyler Givens, Jesse Pratt López, Gioncarlo Valentine, Ebecho Muslimova, Marcel Alcalá, Marlon Kroll, and more artists are available. According to an Instagram post by Towards Utopia, the sale will run until the end of September or until all prints are sold.
""Everyone has a role to play in the revolution. While this year has brought new breadth to the term 'activism' and what it means to sustainably fight for Black America, we are finding that the fight for Black Trans people and Sex Workers continues to fall short,"" Towards Utopia wrote on Instagram.

The organization has released a disclaimer regarding the purchase of artworks from the sale. Buyers must not resell or display artworks in a museum, gallery, or other public exhibition venue without the express consent of the artists. Resales with permission from the artist must direct more than 25 percent of the total sale to an antiracist organization. Those who purchase prints in the sale must also agree not to make copies of the artwork they buy.

Last week, amid criticism from artists, the Whitney Museum in New York canceled an exhibition that had been set to feature works whose sales had benefited mutual aid funds related to the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

And today, as we remember and honour the victims of the crime of genocide, we must not forget that the imperative to prevent genocide lies at the core of our organization’s purpose.
This is evidenced by the adoption of the Genocide Convention in December 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust and the Second World War.
It was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly.
And it remains as relevant as ever as we work to prevent genocide and other atrocity crimes – crimes which are sadly still being perpetrated with impunity and no regard for the sanctity of human life.
This year the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our societies’ deep fragilities and exacerbated already formidable peace and security challenges.
That is why I continue to appeal for a global ceasefire, and I have called on the Security Council to work towards that goal by the end of this year.
Genocide never fails to shock the world when it occurs.
But it is never committed without clear, multiple warning signs.
The victims are often early targets of hate speech, discrimination and violence.
One of our remaining challenges, 72 years after the Genocide Convention’s adoption, is to promptly recognize and act on these warning signs.
We need to remain constantly vigilant of key political, human rights, humanitarian, social and economic developments worldwide to identify early the risks of genocide and other atrocity crimes.
Hate speech is one of these warning signs, and we need to do better in rejecting it in all its forms.
This includes ensuring that technology companies and social media platforms play their part. The power of social media in disseminating hate speech and polarizing communities cannot be underestimated.
I urge a renewed focus on national, regional and international prevention strategies that address, in particular, the incitement of violence against groups or individuals.
Religious leaders and civil society also have a key role to play in preventing and mitigating its risk.
Governments need to guarantee civic space for human rights institutions and defenders to do their essential work and they need to protect the rights of those at risk.
To prevent genocide, it is also essential that we pursue credible and effective accountability.
The link between systemic impunity and atrocity crimes is clear.
The answer lies in impartial investigations backed up by prosecutions.
It also means access to justice and effective remedies for victims.
Because, although accountability processes acknowledge the suffering and courage of victims, they rarely address their psychological and material needs.
Victims have rights to truth, justice, reparation and a comprehensive package of guarantees of non-recurrence.
Today, I want to acknowledge the contribution of national mechanisms, as well as relevant international tribunals and investigative bodies, in ensuring accountability for atrocity crimes.
The Human Rights Council, General Assembly and Security Council investigative bodies – fact-finding missions, groups of experts, high-level missions and commissions of inquiry – also play a fundamental role.
We will listen today to the experiences of victims and reflect on what we can do better to prevent further crimes and to protect victims’ human rights, including their right to reparation.
I also want to pay tribute to the pivotal role of civil society organizations in raising the voices of victims and calling for accountability and reparations.
It often takes decades and generations for a community destroyed by genocide to recover.
Preventing genocide ultimately involves all of society, which must always remain committed and vigilant.
It is crucial that we all join hands to defend the principles of equality and human dignity.
We must work harder to repair the fissures and polarization that are so prevalent in our societies today.
On this international day to commemorate the victims of genocide and affirm their dignity, let us invest in prevention and commit to upholding the responsibilities established in the Genocide Convention."

Cuomo Announces Outdoor Graduations of Up to 150 People Will Be Allowed Beginning June 26",FALSE,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-New York, issued the following transcript on June 7:
Budget Director Robert Mujica to my right. Secretary to the Governor Melissa DeRosa to my left. I'm going to speak a little quickly for some reasons. Number one is because I am a New Yorker and we speak a little quickly. Number two because I promised my daughter Cara I would get home and we would have lunch before she goes to New York City because New York City reopens tomorrow.
Today is day 99 of the COVID crisis. Day 14 of the unrest after the murder of George Floyd, two separate issues. Two separate issues and we are working on both and we will talk about both of them on the reopening. Tomorrow we are going to have a big day with the reopening of New York City. Also, this week we will be taking up a reform agenda in the wake of the George Floyd murder. We will talk about both. Let me speak about the reform agenda first.
We had continued protest across the state last night. For the most part they were peaceful. The protesters all across the state, all across the nation, are basically saying the same thing. There is an anger, there is a frustration, there is a spirit of activism because people want change, and there should be change. And I said from day one that I figuratively stand with the protesters and this is about making change and action. Remember, ""Textbooks say that politicians lead and the people follow. No, it is often the people who lead and the politicians who follow."" A.J. Parkinson, more wisdom from A.J. Parkinson. Frederick Douglass, ""If there is no struggle, there is no progress."" And it is an opportunity for New York State to lead and that's what we do. That's what we did with marriage equality, with minimum wage, with gun safety, with free college tuition, and passing a reform agenda for criminal justice. 50-a, we have talked about, no chokeholds, the Attorney General as a special prosecutor, hate crimes for false 911 reports.
My opinion is the George Floyd reform agenda and what the protesters are trying to achieve, they should set the bar even higher and they should be bolder and they should demand federal reform. You want to change this country that has to happen on the national level. We are in the midst of the national elections and they should put forth a federal agenda that gets to the root cause of the issues. Yes, criminal justice reform, and we know how to do that. But the core inequality and injustice issues, start with the education system, where you have one education system in this country - one for the rich and one for the poor and everybody knows it. In this state, the most progressive state in the United States, a rich school spends $36,000 per student and the poor schools are $13,000 per student. From birth, and from day one of school, depending on the zip code you live in, depending on the income of your family, is the education you get. It's wrong. It's unfair. It's wrong. That has to happen at a federal level. How do you still have children growing up in poverty in this country, the richest country on the globe? It has to change. It can change. Look at the money the government found when they had to battle COVID. You can be creative when you have to - get creative about children living in poverty. And you need a real affordable housing agenda. The federal government, historically, constitutionally, by law provided affordable housing. The Housing Act said safe, clean, decent housing for every American. That was the 1949 Housing Act, paraphrased. The federal government went out of the business, states and locals were supposed to make up. You can't. You had a bevy of federal housing programs, Section 8 programs, voucher programs, building new public housing. If you want to make change in this moment, go to the court issue that is driving the injustice and the equality and get it done. You have this energy and the momentum and now is the time.
In terms of reopening, we have been doing it based on the data and the facts. The number of hospitalizations are down and the number of deaths are up slightly. But overall, the trajectory is down and today is Sunday, and the Sunday numbers tend to be statistically -- there is a variation with the rest of the week. But overall, the numbers are down and the numbers are good. Number of lives lost continues to drop.
We are now doing a tremendous number of tests. As I said, testing is the best mechanism to get a snapshot, right. Where are we today? You test today, and you find out where you are today, right. What is my weight today? You get on a scale and it gets you a number, that's where you are today. We do more testing than any state in the United States. We do more testing than any country per capita on the globe. So, we have the clearest definition of a snapshot. Yesterday, 60,000 tests performed in the State of New York, Saturday. 781 positive tests. Lowest since March 16, okay, which was before we even closed down. About 1 percent positive. That's where we are today. That is very, very good news, okay?
And we said the reopening is calibrated to the metrics in the data. If that's where we are, that's good news, it means the plan is working, it means that we bent the curve, and on those numbers, we can advance the reopening. Hudson Valley is on track for Phase 2 on Tuesday. Long Island is on track for Phase 2 on Wednesday. We're going to allow socially distanced graduations outdoors with up to 150 people total beginning June 26th. That's when the schools start to graduate, high schools, and it gives us a couple of weeks between now and then, God forbid the number changes. But, schools need to plan with the progress we've made so far, and if we continue this trajectory, we'll be able to do that. But again, we have a little time to see between now and then. In terms of New York City, New York city has met all the metrics. We are going to open New York City for Phase 1 tomorrow, period. That will happen. When we begin Phase 1 in New York City, remember that New York City had the highest number of cases. New York City has the highest density. New York City has also been the location for the protests with the most number of people. We are concerned that those protests may have increased the spread of the virus. We are going to do 35,000 tests per day, just in New York City. Snapshot, snapshot, snapshot. We will watch it on a daily basis to find out exactly what is happening.
Remember there was a lag on the infection rate. If you were to protest several days ago, it probably would not show up but when you get through about seven days, you will start to see a pop in the number if those protests actually increased to the spread. We are going to increase the number of testing sites in New York and I am going to ask, again, if you were at a protest, I understand your point and I'm with you. We also have this situation with the coronavirus. Act responsibly. Get a test. Get a test. We are going to open 15 sites that are dedicated just to protesters to get a test so you can get it on an expeditious basis. But please get a test. My opinion and not a fact - I would act as if you were exposed and I would tell people who I'm interacting with, assume I am positive for the virus because you could be infecting other people. But please get that test. That is the one variable in this equation that we are not sure of. We have tested everything else. We have measured everything else and everything was going fine and then we had this large number of protests. We don't know what the effect of those protests are and we are concerned about it. All of the health experts I have spoken to are concerned about it. So while we are waiting to see if there is any result get a test in the meantime.
But New Yorkers have bent the curve by being smart and there are always voices out there who say, everything is fine, I can't see the virus. A person said that to me on the street, ""Look around, do you see the virus?"" Yeah, no. You're not going to see the virus, but you have these voices that say everything is fine, disobey the rules, just open. Look, there are still facts in life. Everybody can have an opinion and then there are still facts. I believe my ideology is government doesn't have a right to tell me to do this. I understand your ideology. Let's look at facts. Look at what is happening around the country. Look at the facts after countries and states reopen and look at what is happening with their curve.
Arizona is seeing an increase in their numbers. South Carolina, new record with more than 500 in a single day. Hot spots across the South and in California as Northeast slows - that's us. California posted highest number of new coronavirus cases on Thursday. Florida 1,000 for the fourth day in a row. U.S. 1.8 million spread rises with turmoil. These are facts. This can happen. This can happen. We know it can happen because it happened here. We've made all this progress. Please, please - I know it's been 90 days - please, stay disciplined, stay smart because it is working. We've come a long way and a lot of people have suffered to get here and a lot of people have died. Let's not be foolish now.
Again, look at what we did. Flatten the curve - forget flatten the curve. I'm going to change the state signs. We bent the curve. We bent the curve. We intended to flatten to get to a plateau, we bent it. Look at the rest of the country. We are curve benders - if there is such a thing. New Yorkers should be proud of their accomplishment. In light of that, we are going to light the landmarks across the state in blue and gold in honor of our New Yorkers, our New York Tough New Yorkers. This is going to be in Manhattan, which is very cool. New York Tough. The Mario Cuomo Bridge, the education building, that's the Corning Tower in the left. These will be the landmarks that will be lit blue and gold to celebrate our accomplishment, because it was an extraordinary accomplishment, because we are New York tough, smart, united, disciplined and loving.

Mr Harrold, a Grammy award-winning trumpeter, posted a clip of the incident in the lobby of the Arlo Hotel which occurred on Saturday, capturing the woman demanding to see his 14-year-old son’s phone.
The footage shows the agitated woman, who has not been identified, repeatedly ordering the hotel manager to get the boy to show her his phone and take it from him.
At one point during the confrontation, the woman appears to move forward and shouts, “I’m not letting him walk away with my phone.”
Mr Harrold, who was staying at the hotel with his son, has alleged the unidentified woman scratched him and tackled and grabbed his son, Keyon Harrold Jr.
""But after the video cuts off and, I mean, she basically tackled, she scratched me, and I was there to, you know, try to protect my little cub,"" Mr Harrold told ABC7 in an interview following the incident.
The woman’s phone was reportedly returned to the hotel by an Uber driver shortly after the incident, the musician said.
 Jazz musician @keyonharrold was staying at @ArloHotels in New York when a woman falsely accused his 14-year-old son of stealing her iPhone. Woman: “He’s not leaving...I’m not letting him walk away with my phone.”The woman’s phone was found in an Uber.pic.twitter.com/qWMKE9XSSy — Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) December 28, 2020 Keyon Harrold Jr, who is seen in the video being instructed by his father not to concede to the woman's demand to see his phone, told ABC7 the incident has left him “shell-shocked.”""I've been confused,"" the teenager told the broadcaster in an interview. ""I mean, don't know what would've happened if my dad wasn't there, honestly. These past few days, still kind of shell-shocked. But I'm hanging in there.""The teenager explained he would like the woman to apologise for the incident and explain why she acted in the way she did towards a “kid who has never met you”.“He’s the sweetest, most genuine kid you could ask for,” Mr Harrold said of his son in an interview on Monday evening. “I was just appalled at how he was treated.”This is racism. Plain and simple. It would be horrific at any age, but it’s especially offensive that it happened to a child.To Keyon Harrold Jr. and his family: I am so sorry this happened to you. Her behavior was an affront to our city’s values. https://t.co/xuWRyHTJmW — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) December 29, 2020
The video, which has received more than two million views since it was posted online, drew ongoing discussions about false accusations made against Black people across the US.
""Fear came in because my son, if his father wouldn't have been there, what would have happened to my son if the cops would have been called,"" the boy’s mother, Kat Rodriguez, told ABC7.
""When my son asked me, 'Why me, mom?' That just hurt.”
Mr Harrold, who has performed with musicians including Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Eminem, said he “couldn't imagine what it would have been like” if he hadn’t been there to stick up for his son.
Ben Crump, the family's attorney, is calling for the Manhattan District Attorney to bring assault and battery charges against the woman.
""We want charges because we have to send a message because this has larger society implications,"" he said.
“As this year of racial awareness is drawing to a close, it’s deeply troubling that incidents like this one, in which a Black child is viewed as and treated like a criminal, continue to happen.”
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also condemned the incidentin a post on Twitter.
“This is racism. Plain and simple,” he said. “It would be horrific at any age, but it’s especially offensive that it happened to a child.”
Mr Crump and the Harrold family have also called for a civil rights investigation into the Arlo Hotel “for its implicit bias” in its treatment of the teen.
“We’re deeply disheartened about the recent incident of baseless accusation, prejudice, and assault against an innocent guest of Arlo Hotel,” the hotel posted on Facebook.
The hotel said that a further investigation into the incident had led them to determine the hotel manager “promptly called the police regarding the woman's conduct” but they added that “more could have been done to de-escalate the dispute.”

Key Facts
The CAREN Act, or the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, refers to the Karen meme used to describe entitled or racist white women.
The ordinance was passed unanimously by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
The CAREN Act makes it illegal to fabricate reports based on someone s race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender or sexual orientation.
It also lets the subject of such calls file civil suits and seek damages.
Supporters say false, racist 911 calls are demoralizing and can put people of color at risk of dangerous interactions with law enforcement.
Mayor London Breed said she will sign the legislation.
Cheif Critics

 MADRID, 26 (EUROPA PRESS)
 U.S. President Donald Trump is committed this Friday to creating three million jobs among the country's African-American community and opening 500,000 new black-run businesses.
 This has been made known by the representative at the atlanta launch of his 'Platinum' program, which includes proposals aimed at gaining greater support among American African Americans for the upcoming November presidential election.
 The president has assured that White House Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden has caused major damage to the black community over the past 47 years. ""They only care about their own power (...) My adversary offers African-Americans nothing but the same old, tired, empty slogans,"" he said, according to CNN.
 Among the proposals launched by the president is the increase of up to $500 billion (more than 580,000 euros) of the budget that African-American communities can access.
 It has also highlighted the importance of achieving ""peaceful"" neighborhoods, greater justice in the judicial system, expanding the school choice system in these areas, as well as creating a ""national clemency project to correct unfair accusations and forgive reformed people.""
 Trump's 'Platinum Plan' also proposes that the 'Juneteenth' holiday, the anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States, be recognized as a party at the federal level.
 The US president has also included his intention to declare the white supremacist group Ku Klux Klan as terrorist organizations, as well as Antifa. In addition, it has conveyed its intention to make lynching a hate crime.
 Trump said in June that he has been the leader who has made the most progress for the African-American population in the history of the American country with the ""possible exception"" of Abraham Lincoln, under whose mandate slavery was abolished.
 In recent days, protesters have taken to the streets of American cities such as Louisville, Washington, New York or Atlanta for the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman shot in her own home, after the officers involved in her death have not been charged with her death.
 Following George Floyd's death on May 25 at the hands of a Minneapolis Police officer, racial tension in the United States has taken center stage again, heightened after new police deaths in recent weeks."

Sharpe Senior District Judge Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 1 of 14 MEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER I. Introduction Plaintiffs pro se Denise J. Jackson and Andre K. Jackson, Jr., mother and son, commenced this action against defendant Cititrends Utica, New York in New York State Supreme Court in Oneida County. (Compl., Dkt. No. 2.) Plaintiffs allege that Cititrends violated their Fourth Amendment rights and “consumer rights,” and treated them with “bias[]” and “prejudic[e].” (Id. at 1.) Cititrends removed the action to this court on the basis of federal question and diversity jurisdiction, (Dkt. No. 1), and then moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, (Dkt. No. 12). For the reasons that follow, Cititrends’ motion to dismiss is granted, and plaintiffs’ complaint is dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend. II. Background1 On August 30, 2019, plaintiffs went to a Cititrends retail store in Utica, New York on two separate occasions. (Compl. at 2.) During their first trip to the store, plaintiffs purchased certain merchandise and were “check[ed] out” by a cashier named “T. Alston” who was “very rude” to them. (Id.) 1 The facts are drawn from plaintiffs’ complaint, (Dkt. No. 2), and presented in the light most favorable to them. 2 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 2 of 14 Later that day, plaintiffs returned to the store to buy items that they “forgot to purchase,” and waited in the line of the store manager, “Pedro.” (Id.) Plaintiffs note that there was one person in front of them in line, who was “of a different nationality” than them. (Id.) Plaintiffs allege that when they arrived at the counter, Pedro “told [them] to go to the black cashier” and stated that that cashier “would wait on ‘you people.’” (Id.) While plaintiffs picked up their merchandise to bring over to the other cashier, which “creat[ed] a huge scene,” Pedro continued to assist people of “another nationality.” (Id.) Plaintiffs allege that it was humiliating to them that, in front of the whole store, Pedro refused to wait on them “because of [their] skin color.” (Id.) When plaintiffs returned home, they were “devastated” by what happened, and they called the store to complain. (Id. at 2-3.) Pedro answered their call, but laughed at them and promptly hung up the phone. (Id. at 3.) Plaintiffs then called back a second time, and spoke to Pedro again, who was still laughing, but provided them with his name and his supervisor’s name. (Id.) The foregoing events have caused plaintiffs to be “tremendously devastated, deeply wounded[,] and emotionally scarred for life.” (Id.) 3 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 3 of 14 It is difficult to discern exactly which claim(s) plaintiffs bring against Cititrends. Indeed, plaintiffs write in generalities about the Fourth Amendment, “consumer rights,” and “hate crimes.” (Id. at 1-3.) However, reading the complaint liberally given plaintiffs’ pro se status, the court agrees with Cititrends, (see generally Dkt. No. 12, Attach. 1), that plaintiffs attempt to allege the following claims: (1) a Fourth Amendment claim; (2) a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1981; (3) a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1983; and (4) a New York State Human Rights Law claim. Additionally, the court reads the complaint as attempting to bring a claim pursuant to Title II of the Civil Rights Act,2 and an intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) claim pursuant to New York State law.3 Plaintiffs request $1,600,000,000 in total damages.4 (Compl. at 3.) III. Standard of Review The standard of review under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is well settled 2 See 42 U.S.C § 2000a. 3 Plaintiffs also make general references to 'hate crimes' in their complaint and in their response to Cititrends’ motion to dismiss. (Compl. at 3; Dkt. No. 19 at 1.) Thus, it is worth noting that “the federal criminal hate crime statute, 18 U.S.C § 249(a), does not create a private right of action.” Pierce v. N.Y State Police (Troop D Lowville), No. 7:05-CV-1477, 2011 WL 1315485, at *7 (N.D.N.Y Apr. 4, 2011) (citations omitted). 4 In response to Cititrends’ motion to dismiss, plaintiffs seem to change their demand to $10,000,000 in damages. (Dkt. No. 19 at 1.) 4 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 4 of 14 and will not be repeated here. For a full discussion of the governing standard, the court refers the parties to its prior decision in Ellis v. Cohen & Slamowitz, LLP, 701 F. Supp. 2d 215, 218 (N.D.N.Y 2010). IV. Discussion Cititrends moves to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint in its entirety, arguing that Cititrends is not a “state actor” and was not acting under “color of state law”; plaintiffs were not prevented from purchasing any items at the store; and the court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state law claims. (Dkt. No. 12, Attach. 1 at 4-7.) In response, plaintiffs do not substantively respond to any of Cititrends’ arguments, or explain why their claims should be maintained under the controlling case law that was presented to them. (See generally Dkt. No. 19.) Instead, plaintiffs merely argue that they will be able to adequately allege their claims after discovery—specifically, after they are provided a video-recording of the relevant events. (Id.) However, “discovery is not for the purpose of finding a cause of action.” Perez v. Johnson, No. 07 Civ. 3761, 2008 WL 2876546, at *3 (S.D.N.Y July 23, 2008). To be sure, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court accepts as true all allegations in the complaint. See Goldstein v. 5 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 5 of 14 Pataki, 516 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 2008). Accordingly, discovery is not needed, and the court will decide Cititrends’ motion to dismiss with the information it has before it. A. Section 1983 Claims Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment and general civil rights claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1983 must be dismissed, because there are no allegations that Cititrends, a private retail establishment, was a state actor or acting under color of state law. “In order to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege that [his federal statutory or constitutional rights were violated] by either a state actor or a private party acting under color of state law.” Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, 292 F.3d 307, 323 (2d Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). “Private actors and institutions generally are not proper defendants to a 42 U.S.C § 1983 action, because they do not act under color of state law.” White v. Monarch Pharm., Inc., 346 F. App’x 739, 740 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); see Young v. Suffolk County, 922 F. Supp. 2d 368, 389 (E.D.N.Y 2013) (“[B]ecause there is no evidence that . . . defendants were acting under color of state law when they allegedly violated plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights, summary judgment . . . is granted in their favor.”). 6 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 6 of 14 However, a private institution may be liable under § 1983 if “there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the [private citizen or entity] so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.” DeMeo v. Tucker, 509 F. App’x 16, 18 (2d Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). Such a nexus exists when the state exercises coercive power, is entwined in the management or control of the private actor, or provides the private actor with significant encouragement, either overt or covert, or when the private actor operates as a willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents, is controlled by an agency of the State, has been delegated a public function by the state, or is entwined with governmental policies. Flagg v. Yonkers Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 396 F.3d 178, 187 (2d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). Viewing plaintiffs’ complaint in the light most favorable to them, Cititrends, a private retail establishment, is not a state actor and was not acting under the color of state law. Accordingly, any claim brought by plaintiffs against Cititrends pursuant to 42 U.S.C § 1983, including their Fourth Amendment claim, must be dismissed. However, as explained below, (see infra Part IV.E), this dismissal is without prejudice. 7 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 7 of 14 B. Section 1981 Claim Section 1981(a) provides, in relevant part, that, “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State . . . to make and enforce contracts, . . . and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S.C § 1981(a). To establish a claim under this statute, “a plaintiff must allege facts in support of the following elements: (1) the plaintiff is a member of a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the basis of race by the defendant; and (3) the discrimination concerned one or more of the statutorily enumerated activities.” See Wong v. Mangone, 450 F. App’x 27, 30 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). The court assumes for purposes of this Memorandum-Decision and Order that plaintiffs are members of a racial minority, and that their allegations are sufficient to establish that, within the meaning of the statute, Pedro intended to discriminate against plaintiffs on the basis of their race. However, plaintiffs’ claim under 42 U.S.C § 1981, to the extent they make such a claim, must be dismissed because they cannot show that the discrimination “concerned one or more of the statutorily enumerated 8 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 8 of 14 activities.” See Wong, 450 F. App’x at 30. The enumerated activity potentially at issue here is plaintiffs’ right to a contracted-for experience with Cititrends. See 42 U.S.C § 1981(b). However, “[v]irtually all federal courts that have analyzed Section 1981 claims in the retail merchandise context have required the plaintiff to show that he was actually prevented from making a purchase.” Benzinger v. NYSARC, Inc. N.Y.C Chapter, 385 F. Supp. 3d 224, 234 (S.D.N.Y 2019) (quoting Rogers v. Elliott, 135 F. Supp. 2d 1312, 1315 (N.D Ga. 2001)); see Hammond v. Kmart Corp., 733 F.3d 360, 362 (1st Cir. 2013) (“[T]o satisfy the foundational pleading requirement for a [§ 1981] suit . . . a retail customer must allege that he was actually denied the ability either to make, perform, enforce, modify, or terminate a contract, or to enjoy the fruits of a contractual relationship, by reason of a race-based animus.” (citation omitted)). Accordingly, because plaintiffs were not prevented from purchasing anything at the store, this claim must be dismissed. See Benzinger, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 234; Bentley v. United Ref. Co. of Pa., 206 F. Supp. 2d 402, 406 (W.D.N.Y 2002) (dismissing a Section 1981 claim because the plaintiff “completed his intended purchases” and “mere delay, even coupled with 9 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 9 of 14 discourteous treatment, poor service, or racial animus, is insufficient to sustain a § 1981 claim” (citations omitted)). However, as explained below, (see infra Part IV.E), this dismissal is also without prejudice. C. Title II Claim Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in statutorily defined “place[s] of public accommodation.” See 42 U.S.C § 2000a(a). The statute’s definition of “place of public accommodation” lists a number of entities covered, but none of these could be construed to include a retail establishment like Cititrends. See id. § 2000a(b). And “[b]ecause Congress specified the establishments which constitute places of public accommodation under § 2000a, courts in this circuit apply the statute to only those covered establishments.” Renxiong Huang v. Minghui.org, No. 17 Civ. 5582, 2018 WL 3579103, at *3 (S.D.N.Y July 25, 2018) (citations omitted). Indeed, case law makes clear that suit may not be brought under 42 U.S.C § 2000a for discrimination in a retail store. See Chavez v. Wylie, No. 18-cv-7965, 2019 WL 6873806, at *3 (S.D.N.Y Dec. 17, 2019) (“Courts have found that retail establishments are not public accommodations under Title II.” (internal quotation marks and citation 10 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 10 of 14 omitted)); Bishop v. Henry Modell & Co., No. 08 Civ. 7541, 2009 WL 3762119, at *13 (S.D.N.Y Nov. 10, 2009) (“[R]etail stores are not places of public accommodation within the meaning of [Title II].” (citations omitted)). Accordingly, plaintiffs’ Title II claim, to the extent they allege such a claim, must be dismissed. And, because better pleading cannot cure plaintiffs’ defect without an entirely new set of facts and allegations (i.e , Cititrends cannot be considered a place of public accommodation) any amendment would be futile as to this claim. Thus, plaintiffs’ Title II claim is dismissed with prejudice. See Shortell v. Office of Court Admin., No. 12 Civ. 0534, 2012 WL 3230492, at *1 (E.D.N.Y Aug. 6, 2012). D. State Law Claims “It is well settled that where, as here, the federal claims are eliminated in the early stages of litigation, courts should generally decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over remaining state law claims.” Klein & Co. Futures v. Bd. of Trade of City of N.Y , 464 F.3d 255, 262 (2d Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). “In deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction over supplemental state-law claims, district courts should balance the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.” Id. (citation omitted). Here, because all of plaintiffs’ federal claims are dismissed, the court 11 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 11 of 14 declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims, to the extent that they bring any. However, in light of the court’s decision to grant plaintiffs’ leave to amend their complaint, (see infra Part IV.E), the court notes that, under New York law, an IIED claim has four elements: “(i) extreme and outrageous conduct; (ii) intent to cause, or disregard of a substantial probability of causing, severe emotional distress; (iii) a causal connection between the conduct and the injury; and (iv) severe emotional distress.” Chanko v. Am. Broad. Cos., Inc., 27 N.Y.3d 46, 56 (2016) (citation omitted). As to the first element, the “conduct [must have] been so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). E. Leave to Amend When addressing a pro se complaint, a district court generally “should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.” Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000) (citations 12 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 12 of 14 omitted). Given their pro se status, and because, with the exception of the Title II claim, amendment may cure plaintiffs’ deficient claims, plaintiffs’ complaint is dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend. If plaintiffs file an amended complaint, they must do so within thirty days of this Memorandum-Decision and Order, and they should consider the rules and analysis explained herein when doing so. Further, any proposed amended complaint must be a wholly integrated and complete pleading that does not rely upon or incorporate by reference any pleading or document previously filed with the court. See Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc., 25 F.3d 1124, 1128 (2d Cir. 1994). This means that any proposed amended complaint cannot merely refer back to plaintiffs’ previous pleadings, nor should it include a Title II claim, which the court has dismissed. V. Conclusion WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Cititrends’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 12) is GRANTED; and it is further ORDERED that plaintiffs’ complaint (Dkt. No. 2) is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE and WITH LEAVE TO AMEND; and it is further 13 Case 6:20-cv-00014-GLS-ATB Document 22 Filed 06/05/20 Page 13 of 14 ORDERED that plaintiffs may file an amended complaint within thirty (30) days of this Memorandum-Decision and Order; and it is further ORDERED that if an amended complaint is not filed within thirty (30) days of this Memorandum-Decision and Order, the action will be dismissed without further order of the court; and it is further ORDERED that Cititrends must respond to plaintiffs’ amended complaint within the time allotted by the rules; and it is further ORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this MemorandumDecision and Order to the parties.

And before yesterday`s race, there was this. This powerful display of support from dozens of Wallace`s fellow drivers. It was something. NBC`s Sam Brock joins us now from Talladega with the very latest. Hey, Sam, good morning.
SAM BROCK (07:18:19): Yeah, Hoda, good morning. Bubba Wallace didn`t win Monday`s race, but this was a victory for everyone. What happened to Talladega was so much more than just an emotional boost for fans and for drivers. It was historic and an incredible moment for a nation at a crossroads.
(Begin VT) MAN #1 (NASCAR/Fox Sports) (07:18:35): Racing is the great equalizer.
SAM BROCK (07:18:37): In a five hundred-lap race at Talladega Superspeedway, it was this unforgettable stretch before the green flag dropped--
MAN (NASCAR/Fox Sports) (07:18:45): The entire garage area has rallied around Bubba Wallace.
SAM BROCK (07:18:49): --that will likely serve as an enduring image for generations of NASCAR fans.
BUBBA WALLACE (NASCAR) (07:18:55): All in all we won the day. The pre-race deal was probably one of the hardest things that I`ve ever had to witness in my life.
SAM BROCK (07:19:03): An emotional Bubba Wallace, the sport`s only black driver wept on the track as dozens of his fellow drivers and their crews showered him with love and support, pulling his number forty-three car to the front of the line after Wallace was the apparent target of a hate crime.
BUBBA WALLACE (NASCAR) (07:19:18): I wanted to show whoever it was that you`re not going to take away my smile and I`m going to keep on going.
SAM BROCK (07:19:25): The act that sickened the sports world, a noose left in Wallace`s garage stall a week after he successfully lobbied NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag. Current drivers and former stars like Dale Earnhardt Junior speaking out.
DALE EARNHARDT JUNIOR (07:19:39): There`s a lot of people rallying around Bubba, but I don`t know that any of us really understands how that must have felt.
SAM BROCK (07:19:46): The FBI is investigating whether any federal laws were violated as NASCAR has launched its own investigation. Racing legend Richard Petty, who runs the team Wallace drives for, called what happened a violation of human decency, tweeting in part, ""There is absolutely no place in our sport or our society for racism."" But even in pain, a teachable moment for families.
(07:20:07): Is this a tough conversation to have, Mark, with your sons about what`s just happened in the last several days? MARK (07:20:12): It`s very tough, but at the same time, you know, I want to make sure that they grow up knowing the difference between right and wrong.
MAN (NASCAR/Fox Sports) (07:20:17): No one is white, black, brown, or yellow. They are all racers.
SAM BROCK (07:20:25): And on this day, the different drivers, crews, and racing teams all united by four simple words, I Stand With Bubba.
(End VT)
SAM BROCK (07:20:36): Former Driver Jeff Gordon called this one of the most powerful, emotional lead ups to any race that he had ever seen. And this was actually a race Bubba Wallace finishing fourteenth, but only guys because he ran out of fuel at the very end. But I don`t think there`s any question as to who the race`s big winner was yesterday.
CRAIG MELVIN (07:20:54): Yeah.
SAM BROCK (07:20:54): Hoda, let me send it back to you.
HODA KOTB (07:20:55): Oh, Sam, that by the way, that image will stay with me. This morning I woke up and saw it. And I literally had to replay it a-- a couple of times just because it was a wow moment.
CRAIG MELVIN (07:21:05): And-- and in the race itself, it sends (unintelligible). Bubba Wallace did really good for most of that race. HODA KOTB (07:21:08): Yeah.
CRAIG MELVIN (07:21:09): It`s really awesome to see what he has come to symbolize, not just in sports, but in this moment that we find ourselves. He`s great spokesman for NASCAR. Thank you, Sam.
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:21:19): Yeah. That little moment of darkness leading to such a beautiful moment in the light. And I think that`s the image that`s going to stick with people.
(07:21:28): Now for something that I think we`ve all been waiting for, for a long time. Al Roker in our neck of the woods, or at least I`ve been waiting. The man, the myth, the legend. Good morning, Al.
AL ROKER (07:21:37): It`s just great to be-- it`s great to be outside of the garage.
SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:21:40): I know.
AL ROKER (07:21:41): Really good. Yes. Keep the peace. Thank you, brother. SAVANNAH GUTHRIE (07:21:43): Yeah, yeah.

Cancel culture is a new concept, but it has quickly grown to become part of our daily lives. Originally stemming from Black Twitter, cancel culture is essentially a digital modern-day boycott where people withdraw their support for a person or company after they have said or done something offensive or wrong. Over the years, we have seen numerous people and companies on the chopping block, receiving criticism from everyone regarding their actions. But cancel culture is not effective. 
Holding a person or a company accountable for their wrongdoings is completely normal. In fact, it is what helps people and companies understand the error of their actions and elicit change. It gives people the opportunity to understand why their actions are harmful and allows them to grow to be more inclusive and mindful. 
However, cancel culture feeds into the idea that no matter what they do to remedy the situation, either through a heartfelt apology or withdrawing from the public eye to reflect and educate, they will always be reminded of their harmful actions. With a mindset like that, it leaves no opportunity for people to learn, understand and grow from their mistakes. 
As makeup artist Matt Bernstein pointed out in his Instagram post, the punishment does not fit the crime. For both people who do not regret spreading dangerous ideologies and people who are genuinely sorry for ignorant posts, the punishment is the same. Cancel culture treats everyone who made mistakes the same way on the same platform, equating an ignorant comment with a hate crime. In real life, these would not even be considered for the same punishment. 
I believe that the original concept of cancel culture was good-natured. People wanted powerful individuals to step down from their positions because of the harm they caused others from their remarks or actions. As Lisa Nakamura, Ph.D., professor of American culture at the University of Michigan, states in a New York Times article, ""It's a cultural boycott. It's an agreement not to amplify, signal boost, give money to. People talk about the attention economy - when you deprive someone of your attention, you're depriving them of a livelihood."" 
But that original concept rarely works since ""canceled"" powerful people continue to have platforms. For example, Woody Allen continued to make movies despite being accused of sexual assault. Mel Gibson earned Academy Award nominations despite spouting anti-semetic slurs and beliefs. U.S. President Donald Trump won the 2016 election despite spitting out hateful rhetoric and beliefs. 
The idea of ""canceling"" someone does not make them learn from their mistakes, it just shakes their feathers. In the past few years, famous people and companies have been canceled numerous times, yet they still have large followings. This demonstrates the ineffectiveness of cancel culture and how ""de-platforming"" companies and celebrities does nothing to make them understand the harm behind their remarks or actions. It essentially stunts their opportunity to grow. 
The original concept of cancel culture became lost in translation by people attempting to purify themselves by consistently going after every person accused of wrongdoings to make themselves look better in comparison. As Black feminist Loretta Ross pointed out in a New York Times column, cancel culture has done nothing to properly justify the criticisms of dangerous individuals, but rather serves to score points for the ""self-appointed guardians of political purity."" 
Just because the idea of cancel culture is ineffective does not mean that we should abandon our efforts of achieving social justice. Everyone is human, and everyone makes mistakes in the past, but that does not mean that we should be constantly judged for them. We are capable of acknowledging our wrongdoings and making efforts to become better people. We need to focus our efforts on affairs that truly need our attention. "
39,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-10-26,"4285 words",NA,NA,NA,"Annual Review of New Criminal Justice Legislation 2020",FALSE,"Albany , NY: New York State Bar Association has issued the following press release:
In the midst of an historic pandemic, the legislature enacted changes in two critical areas of the criminal justice system. It enacted changes to the bail and discovery laws it passed last year and, in addition, it passed an expansive package of police reform bills. At the same time, the New York City Council enacted a series of new laws that will have a significant impact on members of the New York City Police Department.
Bail and Discovery
In 2019, the legislature enacted sweeping changes in the areas of bail and discovery. After those changes became effective on January 1 of this year, advocates and prosecutors waged a fierce battle over amending last year’s legislation and both sides came away with some measure of achievement. The amendment to the bail statute was effective July 2 while the amendment to the discovery legislation became effective on May 3.[1]
With respect to bail, the legislature neither eliminated cash bail altogether nor added a provision authorizing judges to assess a defendant’s “dangerousness.” It did, however, expand the number of “qualifying offenses” for which monetary bail may be set and the number of non-monetary conditions of release that judges can impose.
The legislature did not add any additional violent felony crimes to the list of qualifying offenses, although it designated strangulation in the second degree – already bail-eligible as a violent felony under the original legislation – explicitly bail-eligible if committed as a domestic violence crime.
In the original legislation, burglary in the second degree, a violent felony, was classified as a non-qualifying offense when a defendant was charged under subsection (2), i.e , entering a “dwelling” with the intent to commit a crime. The amendment makes clear that the crime becomes a qualifying offense when an individual enters the “living area of the dwelling.”[2] The term “living area” is not defined in the Penal Law and entering the “living area” is not an element of the crime. As a result, prosecutors will need to inform the court at arraignments as to any facts that support a request for bail.
It would appear that in multiple-unit buildings, bail cannot be set when a defendant enters a non-living area such as a vestibule, roof, or lobby. In a one-family house, a porch or basement may constitute a “non-living area.” In People v. McCray,[3] the Court of Appeals held that a burglary committed in the non-residential part of a building used partly for residential purposes should not be treated as the burglary of a dwelling.
The legislature also added approximately 20 non-violent felonies to the list of qualifying offenses. A number of prosecutors and law enforcement officials had publicly expressed criticism that many of these felonies were not included in the original legislation as bail-eligible. Under the amendment, for example, the following non-violent felonies are bail-eligible: all A-1 drug felonies; certain financial crimes (grand larceny in the first degree and certain money laundering charges); all subsections of sex trafficking that were not bail-eligible under the original legislation; and certain hate crimes (assault in the third degree and arson in the third degree if committed as a hate crime).
In addition, bail can now be set for “any crime that is alleged to have caused the death of another person.”[4] This would include all offenses under Article 125 of the Penal Law, a number of which are non-violent offenses, e.g , criminally negligent homicide, manslaughter, etc.[5]
The amendment also permits judges to set bail on certain repeat offenders. For example, bail can now be set for an individual who is charged with a felony offense while serving a sentence of probation or while released to post-release supervision.[6] In addition, any felony becomes bail-eligible when the defendant “qualifies for sentencing on such charge as a persistent felony offender.”[7]
In addition, bail can now be set when an individual is charged with two sequential crimes (either a felony or Class A misdemeanor) “involving harm to an identifiable person or property.”[8] Before a judge can set bail, however, the prosecutor must establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed both the instant and underlying crimes.
Courts will need to define “harm” as the statute does not provide any guidance. It remains to be seen whether courts will limit the definition to physical harm or whether they will apply a more expansive interpretation and include financial or emotional harm.
Certain misdemeanors have been added to the list of qualifying offenses and, not surprisingly, relate to a defendant’s failure to appear in court, e.g , escape from custody and bail jumping. While these misdemeanors and others specified in the amendment are bail-eligible, none are subject to remand. Defendants charged with qualifying offenses that are felonies, however, are subject to bail or remand.
Finally, although an offense may not be bail-eligible, once a defendant pleads guilty to that offense or is found guilty of that offense after trial, a court can now set bail or remand the defendant between the conviction and sentencing date.[9]
The legislature also expanded the number of non-monetary conditions a judge can impose when releasing a defendant. The amendment makes clear that this is not an exclusive list and that a defendant shall not be required to pay for any part of the cost of any non-monetary condition, e.g , electronic monitoring.[10]
The new conditions are broad in scope. For example, as a condition of release, a defendant may have to agree not to associate with individuals “connected [to] the instant charge including victims, witnesses or co-defendants.”[11]. A court can also now require a defendant to attend mandatory treatment programs as determined by a pretrial services agency, e.g , counseling, drug treatment and violence intervention programs.
In addition, a court may, where applicable, direct a defendant to be removed to a hospital pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law § 9.43 which provides for at least a 72-hour period of emergency hospitalization for immediate observation, care, and treatment. Although this is listed as a new condition of release, some courts had been imposing this condition prior to the legislation. As another condition of release, a defendant can be required to make “diligent” efforts to maintain employment, enrollment in school or educational programming. Finally, a court can require, as a condition of release, that the defendant obey an order of protection issued by the court.[12]
In the original legislation, electronic monitoring was authorized, under certain circumstances, as a condition of release. The amendment clarifies this condition in two respects. First, a defendant cannot be required to pay for the monitoring. Second, counties and municipalities may contract with private companies to supply the monitoring devices, but only employees of the municipalities or state, and not the contractors, can have any interaction with a defendant for the purpose of monitoring.[13]
The legislature also responded to certain concerns generated by the initial legislation. For example, the original legislation provided that a desk appearance ticket must be returnable no later than 20 days from the date it is issued. The amendment provides that the 20-day period may be extended to the “next scheduled session” of the court if such session is not within 20 days of the issuance date.[14]
In addition, in the original legislation courts were given the responsibility of notifying a defendant of any future court appearance by text message, telephone call, first class mail, or electronically , and the defendant had the option of selecting the method of notification. Under the amendment, a defendant forfeits such notice if he or she intentionally declines to provide the information necessary for him or her to receive it. In addition, a failure by the court to provide notice of a scheduled court appearance shall not constitute grounds or authorization for a defendant to fail to appear in court.[15]
Finally, the legislature expanded the availability for release, pending sentence or appeal, for defendants who are not convicted of a qualifying offense. Courts continue to have the authority to set bail pending sentence or appeal (with certain existing exceptions) when a defendant is convicted of a qualifying offense. When a defendant is convicted of a non-qualifying offense, a court now has the authority to set bail, or in the alternative, release the defendant on his own recognizance or set non-monetary conditions for release.[16]
The legislature also amended the discovery statute effective May 3 of this year. One amendment eases the timeline that was imposed on prosecutors in the original legislation; under that provision, a prosecutor had 15 calendar days from the defendant’s arraignment date to provide discovery (with some exceptions). Under the amendment, if a defendant is in custody the prosecution has 20 calendar days to perform its initial discovery obligations. If a defendant is not in custody, the deadline is 35 calendar days. If a defendant is initially in custody but released before the 20-day deadline, does the prosecutor then get 35 days to provide discovery? The statute is silent on that point.
The original legislation gave prosecutors an additional, automatic 30 days, without the need for a motion, to provide discovery when the discoverable materials are “exceptionally voluminous.” The amendment attempts to clarify the definition of “exceptionally voluminous” by giving examples of material that may fit that definition: video footage from body-worn cameras, surveillance cameras or dashboard cameras. In addition, it also permits prosecutors to extend the 30-day period by making a motion pursuant to CPL § 245.70(2).
The amendment expands the right of the prosecution to withhold certain pieces of information as part of its initial discovery obligation, without having to obtain a protective order. Thus, in addition to withholding the identity of a confidential informant, a prosecutor can now withhold the identity of a 911 caller, a victim or witness in sex offenses and sex trafficking cases and a victim or witness of a crime where the defendant has a substantial affiliation with a “criminal enterprise” as that term is defined under the Enterprise Corruption Act.[17]
The prosecutor must notify the defense that information is being withheld under this section and the defense can then move for disclosure of this information.[18] In ruling on the motion, a court can also order that a transcript of the 911 recording be disclosed in lieu of the recording itself.[19] Although the prosecution can withhold the identity of a 911 caller, if he or she intends to call such person as a witness at a hearing or trial, the prosecution must disclose the name and contact information no later than 15 days before a hearing or trial. In addition, although the prosecutor can now withhold the identity of a 911 caller, the defense would still be entitled to any statements of potential witnesses under CPL § 240.20(1)(e). Thus, an argument can be made that the statement of a 911 caller must still be turned over provided the statement is redacted to prevent the disclosure of the caller’s identity.
The original legislation addressed the possibility that a defendant may wish to waive discovery; the amendment seeks to clarify that issue. Prior to accepting a waiver, which must be signed by counsel, a court must now inquire of the defendant, on the record, to ensure that the defendant understands his or her right to discovery. On the other hand, a court cannot require, as a condition of a plea, that counsel advise his or her client about the right to waive discovery. Finally, when a conviction is vacated on agreement between the parties pursuant to CPL § 440.10, a waiver of discovery can be a condition of a new guilty plea.[20]
The procedure for a protective order has been changed. Under the original legislation, unless a defendant consents to the prosecution’s request for a protective order, a court must conduct a hearing within three business days to determine whether good cause has been shown. Under the amendment, a prosecutor can now request that certain hearings be conducted in camera and outside the presence of the defendant.[21]
Thus, when a defendant is charged with a violent felony or any Class A felony (other than a Class A drug felony), a court can conduct a hearing as outlined above if the prosecutor establishes “good cause.” The statute is silent on a number of points. Can defense counsel be present at the hearing? In determining “good cause,” what factors must a court consider?
As the initial legislation made clear, the prosecution’s burden to comply with discovery, and to file a certificate of compliance, is driven by the sanctions under the speedy trial statute. Thus, certain amendments to the discovery statute will have an impact on the prosecution’s speedy trial obligations.
For example, the trial readiness standard has been lessened to some extent. Under the original legislation, a prosecutor can be deemed ready for trial even if he or she has not filed a certificate of compliance if a court finds that “exceptional circumstances” exist. Under the amendment, a court need only find “special circumstances,” although the difference between “exceptional” and “special” seems ambiguous.[22]
The amendment makes clear that any challenges to a certificate of compliance must be “addressed by a motion.”[23]. The statute is silent on whether the motion must be in writing. If the motion is made orally, it would seem wise for appellate purposes to incorporate the grounds for the oral motion in any written motion made pursuant to CPL § 30.30 [24]
In addition, a prosecutor will now be able to file a certificate of compliance when discoverable material is lost or destroyed provided that (1) there are diligent and good faith efforts to locate the material; and (2) the efforts to locate the material are reasonable under the circumstances.[25]
Police Reform
The legislature also enacted an expansive package of police reform bills. The centerpiece was the repeal of Civil Rights Law § 50-a (CRL § 50-a), which had shielded from public disclosure certain police records containing disciplinary actions and misconduct complaints. The statute was enacted in 1976 to prevent what were then perceived as efforts by defense counsel to utilize information contained in police personnel records to cross-examine and impeach officers during trial in an overly aggressive and unfair manner.[26]
Prior to the repeal of CRL § 50-a, New York and Delaware were the only states that had provided statutory protection to police officer personnel records. With the repeal, New York has joined 12 other states in promoting transparency of police disciplinary procedures.
Under the new law,[27] section 50-a of the Civil Rights Law is repealed and, as a result, police personnel files are now to be treated in the same manner as other police records for the purpose of discovery. The new law did, however, amend the Public Officers Law to require certain limited information to be redacted when personnel files are disclosed.
Thus, before providing records, a law enforcement agency must redact certain personal information, including medical history, home address, personal phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and the like. In addition, the agency can redact records pertaining to a “technical infraction.” A technical infraction is defined as one that does not involve interaction with members of the public; is not of public concern; and is not otherwise connected to a police officer’s investigative, enforcement or training responsibilities. Technical infractions might include uniform violations or untidy stationhouse lockers.
An argument can be made that, after the repeal of CRL § 50-a, prosecutors must automatically turn over disciplinary records from police personnel files as part of their new discovery obligations under Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law. This arises from their responsibility to disclose all information that “tends to . . . impeach the credibility of a testifying prosecution witness.”[28]
In the event that a prosecutor fails to turn over this material, or does so in an untimely manner, defense counsel still have the option of making a freedom of information (FOIL) request. In several cities in New York State, including New York City, plans have been announced to create a public online database of police disciplinary records that will alleviate the delay in processing a FOIL request.
A second major legislative reform was the criminalization of chokeholds when conducted by law enforcement.[29] The new law, entitled the “Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act,” was named for the Staten Island resident who died in 2014 after a police officer used a chokehold on him during an arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes.
Under the new law, Aggravated Strangulation (a Class C violent felony) is committed when a police officer or peace officer either (1) commits the crime of criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation; or (2) uses a chokehold that applies pressure to the throat or windpipe of a person in a manner that may hinder breathing or reduce intake of air; and (3) thereby causes serious physical injury or death to another person.
Although the New York City Police Department banned the use of chokeholds in 1993, the Civilian Complaint Review Board reported that chokeholds continued to be used by police officers with alarming frequency. Thus, the legislature determined that the administrative ban on the use of chokeholds was not sufficient to prevent its use and enacted the new law imposing criminal sanctions. Ten days after the enactment of the law, a New York City police officer was arrested and charged with aggravated strangulation.
To complicate matters, on July 15, 2020, Mayor de Blasio signed into law an amendment to the New York City Administrative Code which also criminalized the use of chokeholds. Under Administrative Code § 10-181, “no person shall restrain an individual in a manner that restricts the flow of air or blood by compressing the windpipe or the carotid arteries on each side of the neck, or sitting, kneeling or standing on the chest or back in a manner that compresses the diaphragm, in the course of effecting or attempting to effect an arrest.”
Under this section, a person who engages in this conduct shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment of not more than one year, a fine of not more than $2,500 or both. The section does not provide for any other type of sentence, e.g , probation, conditional discharge or unconditional discharge.
While the new state and local laws penalize the same generic conduct, they are different in a number of respects. The local law is more restrictive in that it includes contact with a person’s chest or back, in addition to contact with the neck and throat, the only areas that are covered by the state law. The local law is a strict liability statute, eliminating the need to establish any intent to cause injury to the victim. Finally, under the state law, the conduct is a violent felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison; the local law provides punishment of up to one year in jail.
Although both statutes address, in general, the same generic conduct, the local law would not appear to be prohibited under the doctrine of preemption. That doctrine prohibits a municipality from exercising police power when the legislature has expressly, or by implication, restricted such an exercise by preempting the area of regulation.[30] Absent an express intention by the legislature, preemption may also be inferred from a declaration of state policy by the legislature or from the fact that the legislature has enacted a comprehensive and detailed regulatory scheme in a particular area, e.g , sex offender registration.[31]
Furthermore, the state has not signaled an intention to regulate the use of chokeholds throughout the state, given the state legislature’s recognition that local municipalities do play a role in regulating police conduct. Finally, the fact that a local law imposes a lesser penalty than a state statute does not render it inconsistent with the state law; the two laws can co-exist, with the state law supplementing the local law by providing for more severe penalties for the same offense.[32] Thus, the prosecutor would have the discretion to choose which statute to use in charging a police officer.
The state legislative package of police reforms includes a number of other measures that respond to incidents that have been reported in the press. For example, one measure, the “New Yorker’s Right to Monitor Act,” establishes the right of a citizen to record law enforcement activity and to maintain custody and control of that recording.[33] The measure creates a private cause of action, i.e , the unlawful interference with recording law enforcement activities, which must be commenced within three years of the date of the incident. The interference may be committed in a number of ways. An officer can interfere by preventing a person from recording law enforcement activity; threatening that person for recording a law enforcement activity; commanding that the person cease recording law enforcement activity; seizing, ticketing or arresting that person because that person recorded a law enforcement activity; or unlawfully seizing property used by that person to record a law enforcement activity.
Under the new cause of action, an individual can seek damages, including punitive damages. The statute creates an affirmative defense for a police officer who, at the time such conduct was committed, had probable cause to arrest the person for obstructing governmental administration while the person was recording the law enforcement activity.
Another measure establishes civil penalties for using a 911 call to summon a police officer without any reason to believe that a crime or imminent threat to safety is occurring.[34] This law is intended to prevent the blatant misuse of 911 calls for non-emergency situations, which taxes the valuable resources of law enforcement agencies.
Police officers are now required to verbally report incidents involving the discharge of their weapons within six hours of the occurrence.[35] In addition, they must file a written report within 48 hours of the incident. This measure was enacted in response to an incident in New York County in which an off-duty police officer fired his weapon at a car after arguing with a young man who had cut him off on FDR Drive, resulting in the death of one of the occupants. Until the officer reported the incident the next day, the police spent considerable resources trying to determine the identity of the shooter. This new measure would prevent such occurrences.
Other legislative reforms include the creation of a cause of action against a police officer who fails to obtain medical and mental health treatment for a person who is under arrest and within the custody of the officer. A person who does not receive such treatment and, as a result, suffers serious physical injury or significant exacerbation of an injury can seek damages from the officer and/or the police department.[36]
Beginning April 1, 2021, New York State police troopers will be required to use body-worn cameras while on patrol. They must keep video records of all interactions that troopers have with individuals including arrests, searches of persons and property, investigative actions, and all use of force and interactions with people suspected of criminal activity.[37]
Finally, a new law creates an office of special investigation within the Office of the State Attorney General. The office will have authority to investigate, and prosecute, any incident in which the death of a person is caused by an act or omission of a police officer or certain peace officers. The measure is designed to promote public confidence by removing what some believe is a potential conflict when district attorneys investigate deaths caused by police officers. Some have argued that, based on the close working relationship between prosecutors and the police, there is an appearance that prosecutors cannot remain impartial.[38]
On July 15, 2020, Mayor de Blasio signed a series of police reform bills that will affect the New York City Police Department. In addition to the new chokehold law mentioned above, the New York City Council enacted a new law establishing the right of a person to record police activities. Similar to the statewide law, this provision creates a cause of action for unlawful interference with recording police activities. Under Administrative Code § 14-189, this right is separate and distinct from other remedies provided by the state. The action must be commenced within one year and 90 days after a violation of this section.[39]
Included among the other measures is a new law that requires the reporting and evaluation of surveillance technologies used by the New York City Police Department. The department would be required to issue information about surveillance technologies; the public will then have a period of time to submit comments.
Despite the crippling effects of the current pandemic, it is evident from the above discussion that the legislature was able to enact a number of bills that will have a significant impact on the criminal justice system as we move forward into 2021."

Thomas Lane's lawyer, Earl Gray, filed the motion to dismiss the charges (full report below).
The news broke as it emerged that a black New York birdwatcher will refuse to co-operate with prosecutors against a woman known as ""Central Park Karen"" who falsely told police the man was attacking her.
Christian Cooper, 57, used his phone to take video footage of Amy Cooper (no relation), 41, telling cops he was threatening her after he asked her to put her dog on a leash.
The video went viral and led to widespread condemnation of Amy and the labelling of her as a ""Karen"" - a term referring to an entitled white woman. The term is also used on social media to describe bigoted white women who unnecessarily call police on people of colour.
She was sacked from her job as a head of insurance portfolio management at Franklin Templeton as the storm of controversy grew against the background of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Police also took a dim view of her actions when it became clear that despite filming her, Mr Cooper never threatened her and even encouraged her to call the police as the incident continued.
Ms Cooper was charged with falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, which police said they regard as a serious matter.
But Mr Cooper said he believes the woman has already paid a high price for her actions and he will not be assisting prosecutors.
""On the one hand, she's already paid a steep price,"" Mr Cooper told the New York Times. 
""That's not enough of a deterrent to others? Bringing her more misery just seems like piling on.
""If the DA feels the need to pursue charges, he should pursue charges. But he can do that without me.""
Announcing the charges, Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, said: ""Our office initiated a prosecution of Amy Cooper for falsely reporting an incident in the third degree.
""We are strongly committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable.""
Ms Cooper was issued a desk appearance ticket and will be arraigned on October 14. 
Mr Cooper, a Harvard graduate who works in communications, has long been a prominent birdwatcher in the city and is on the board of the New York City Audubon Society.
He said he accepted Ms Cooper's apology, which she issued through a public relations firm.
During the incident on May 25, Ms Cooper was asked by birdwatcher Mr Cooper to put her dog on a leash, as park guidelines dictate.
In a Facebook post, he claimed the dog was ""tearing through the plantings"" in the Ramble area of the park, and told her she should go to another part of the park. 
When she refused, he pulled out dog treats, causing her to shout at him to not come near her dog. 
Ms Cooper then called the police, adopting a hysterical tone when talking to the operator and demanding that officers respond because she was being threatened.
""I'm in the Ramble, there is a man, African-American, he has a bicycle helmet and he is recording me and threatening me and my dog,"" she said hysterically to the 911 operator as she gripped her dog's collar tightly. 
""I am being threatened by a man in the Ramble, please send the cops immediately!""
The development comes as San Francisco looks to take aim against so-called ""Karens"" - by introducing an ordinance making it illegal to report bogus ""racially biased"" calls to cops.
City Supervisor Shamann Walton said he introduced the CAREN Act - or the Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act - during Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting in response to several high-profile 911 calls involving people of colour.
""This is the CAREN we need,"" Walton tweeted, adding that ""racist 911 calls"" are unacceptable.
The ordinance would amend San Francisco Police Code to make it unlawful for anyone to ""fabricate false racially-biased emergency reports"".
COP CHARGED OVER DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD WANTS TO WALK FREE
The George Floyd cop who ""tried to have Derek Chauvin turn him over"" has asked for his charges to be dropped.
Thomas Lane's lawyer, Earl Gray, filed the motion to dismiss the charges, the Star Tribune reported.
The lawyer said that there is not enough evidence to establish probable cause that Lane committed a crime, according to the outlet.
Gray has previously argued about the charges as he said that the officer asked if they should turn Floyd over.
Lane is one of the four Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd - who died on May 25 after a Minnesota cop knelt on his neck.
Last month, he posted bail and was released from prison.
NEW VIDEO SHOWS COP IN TENSE STANDOFF WITH NY FAMILY
Meanwhile, new shocking video has emerged once more apparently showing police using extreme force against a suspect in highly emotional, charged circumstances.
The disturbing video has emerged of a cop in Schenectady - about 300km north of Manhattan - punching a man and kneeling on his neck during a violent altercation that drew comparisons to the Minneapolis police arrest of George Floyd, who died after being unable to breathe, according to a report.
Yugeshwar Gaindarpersaud, 31, a member of the upstate city's Guyanese community, told the Daily Gazette that he was stopped Monday by police investigating a report that his neighbour's tires had been slashed.
He said he told the unidentified officer to provide evidence and began walking away.
""Put your hands behind your back!"" the cop orders as he pulls out a pair of handcuffs, according to the footage shot by the man's father, Jaindra, who was ordered to move back during the encounter.
""Put your hands behind your [expletive] back!"" the officer yells as he lifts Yugeshwar's leg and begins punching him in the torso as he appears not to move.
As the officer delivers the blows, his father and wife yell in protest.
""You got the foot on his head!"" Jaindra shouts. ""You've got the foot on his head!""
Two additional officers finally show up and place him in handcuffs. Only then does the first cop remove his knee from Gaindarpersaud's neck area.
Police Chief Eric Clifford defended the officer's actions, saying Gaindarpersaud was resisting arrest ""both actively and passively"" and was ignoring orders.
""The goal of law enforcement during a combative encounter should be to gain control of the subject, situation and achieve custody without causing injury,"" Clifford said, according to the Gazette.
""At no time did the officer attempt to impair Mr. Gaindarpersaud's breathing or blood circulation. The officer was alone and attempting to gain control of the continually struggling Mr. Gaindarpersaud,"" he added.
CAR SLAMS INTO WOMAN IN SHOCKING VIDEO FROM VIDEO
WARNING: GRAPHIC FOOTAGE
Video taken during a protest in the US over the weekend has captured the moment a car slammed into a woman and drove off with her on the hood.
At least two protesters were struck, reported local Indiana station, WRTV-TV.
It comes as violence continues to escalate across the US amid racial tensions and Black Lives Matter protests and the death of George Floyd while in police custody. 
The protesters were calling for the arrests of a group of white men in an alleged attempted lynching of a black man in the town of Bloomington.
The alleged incident happened on July 4 in which several people hurling racial slurs pinned a black man down.
Vauhxx Booker, a civil rights activist in Bloomington, detailed the incident in a harrowing Facebook post.
""I don't want to recount this, but I was almost the victim of an attempted lynching,"" he wrote. ""I don't want this to have happened to me or anyone. It hurts my soul, and my pride, but there are multiple witnesses and it can't be hidden or avoided.""
As he and a friend cut through some woods to a public area around Monroe Lake to see the lunar eclipse, they were stopped by a large, ""seemingly drunk"" man in a Confederate hat, he said, adding that he could only describe the July 4 attack as a hate crime.
""I was attacked by five white men (with confederate flags) who literally threatened to lynch me in front of numerous witnesses,"" Booker wrote.
It was a group hanging out in the woods, blocking access to the public beach, and claiming to own the land, he said. When he and his friends tried to leave after talking to them, five large men jumped him, piling on, pinning his arms behind his back and threatening to break them.
They dragged him and pinned his body against a tree, he said, ripping out some hair and at one point jumping on his neck.
""At one point during the attack one of the men jumped on my neck,"" he wrote. ""I could feel both his feet and his full body weight land hard against my neck.""
That's when people started filming, videos that Booker also posted and The Bloomingtonian combined into a single YouTube video - clips disturbing enough that Booker cautioned his friends and family they ""may not want to watch.""
Police arrived at the scene and declined to press charges against the men, despite the videos and first-hand accounts by numerous witnesses, including those who had separated Booker from his attackers.
""I lack the ability to adequately express my thoughts regarding this moment,"" Booker wrote. ""How many Black people had the same surreal and terrifying experience of strangers talking about their own murders in front of them, who then didn't live to see another day.""
On Monday (local time), hundreds of people gathered outside the Monroe County Courthouse in Bloomington to demand arrests.
Police said an investigation is under way.
""The Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Law Enforcement Division is working diligently with the Monroe County Prosecutor's Office to ensure a lawful resolution,"" the DNR told the Indianapolis Star. ""This matter remains under investigation, and no further information will be released at this time.""
MAN GUNNED DOWN ON NYC STREET IN FRONT OF HIS DAUGHTER
Meanwhile, harrowing surveillance footage captured the moment a man was fatally shot while crossing a New York street - hand-in-hand with his four-year-old daughter.
The video opens with Anthony Robinson approaching a crosswalk in the Bronx around 5:50pm (7.50am AEST) on Sunday, reports the New York Post.
Clasping his young daughter's left hand in his right, Robinson, 29, stops at a crosswalk to eye a dark car slowing next to them, appearing to check whether the driver was turning into their path.
But the driver continues to roll along next to father and daughter as they cross the street, the video shows.
Nearly out of the crosswalk, Robinson turns as though to say something to his daughter - leaving his back to the sedan.
The shooter then sticks a handgun out of the passenger's window and opens fire, striking Robinson in the chest.
As Robinson crumples to the pavement, his terrified daughter takes off running down Sheridan Avenue, apparently unharmed, the footage shows.
Robinson, a resident of East New York, Brooklyn, was pronounced dead at BronxCare Health System.
His murder was one of eight across the city on a bloody July 4th holiday weekend in New York, his shooting one of at least 49.
Police have yet to make an arrest in the case.
'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH' AFTER YOUNG GIRL SHOT DEAD
It comes as Atlanta remained on edge after the shooting death of an eight-year-old girl over the weekend.
Secoriea Turner was killed, police said, after an armed group stopped her family's car near the Wendy's restaurant where black man Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by police last month.
""You killed your own - you killed your own this time,"" her father, Secoriya Williamson, said. ""You killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody.""
""I am asking you to please honour this baby's life. Please, if you know who did this, please turn them in,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said.
""Enough is enough. We have talked about this movement that is happening across America at this moment in time when we have the ears and the interest of people across this country and across this globe who are saying they want to see change.""
Mayor Bottoms' sentiments were echoed throughout the US as a number of children have died in recent days in a surge of gun violence. 
TRUMP IN WAR OF WORDS WITH SPORTS STAR
On Monday, a war of words erupted between Donald Trump and NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace after the US President demanded the star ""apologise"" over a ""hoax"" noose that was found in his garage stall.
Wallace, the sport's only black driver, accused the US President of spreading ""hate"".
""Has @BubbaWallace apologised to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?"" Mr Trump said on Twitter on Monday (local time).
Wallace responded soon after with a statement, saying, ""Always deal with the hate being thrown at you with LOVE! Love over hate every day. Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate. Even when it's HATE from the POTUS.""
NBA superstar LeBron James backed Wallace up. ""Right HERE too with you!!"" James replied. ""As well as the next generation who follows in my footsteps! Kings and Queens.""
The garage door pull-rope fashioned like a noose - widely seen as a symbol of lynchings in the American South - sparked outrage when it was found but the FBI concluded it was not the result of a hate crime.
Dozens of Wallace's fellow drivers staged a demonstration against bigotry but the FBI probe discovered that the rope had been hanging in the stall months before the June 23 race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.
Mr Trump also spoke out on Monday (local time) about US sports franchises considering changing their Native American-themed team names - ahead of November's presidential election.
The noose discovery was made shortly after Wallace had successfully campaigned for a ban on flying the controversial Confederate flag at NASCAR, a popular sport with conservative Americans.
Mr Trump also claimed in his tweet that the ban and the noose controversy had ""caused lowest ratings EVER!"" 
NASCAR president Steve Phelps noted after the inquiry had finished that ""the noose was real"" and ""our initial reaction was to protect our driver."" ""In hindsight, I should have used the word 'alleged' in our statement,"" said Mr Phelps.
'POLITICALLY CORRECT'
Mr Trump also took aim at the NFL after the governing body of America's National Football League backed a decision by the Washington Redskins to launch a ""thorough review"" of the team's name, which is a term for Native Americans that is seen as a slur.
Major sponsors such as Nike, PepsiCo and FedEx have finally put pressure on the organisation to reconsider its name after years of protesting.
But Mr Trump was not impressed. 
""They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,"" Mr Trump said via Twitter. ""Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!""
The United States has been up-ended by coast-to-coast protests since the May killing of African-American George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.
The demonstrations have seen attacks on symbols of the country's slave-holding history such as the Confederate flag and statues of Confederate generals.
Mr Trump has branded the movement a ""left-wing cultural revolution"" and an assault on American ""heritage,"" and vowed to resist it.
The White House slammed the media over the Wallace clash, saying reporters were ""mischaracterising"" Mr Trump's words.
""The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans, and those who have gone in this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime, when in fact the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act,"" Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.
Ms McEnany also declined to say whether Mr Trump agrees with NASCAR's decision to ban the rebel-themed flag, saying the president has not made a judgment ""one way or the other."" 
MOMENT CAR STRIKES BLM PROTESTERS
A young Black Lives Matter protester has died after a man drove through a small group of demonstrators in Seattle on the July 4 weekend.
Summer Taylor, 27, died hours after a man in a white Jaguar drove through a closed section of a freeway at 1.40am on Saturday (local time), hitting her and another woman, Diaz Love, who was left seriously injured.
The shocking incident was caught on surveillance video which shows the vehicle speeding down the freeway and swerving around a car before striking the two women and launching them into the air.
The driver fled the scene but was later arrested.
""Very candidly, we don't know, at this point in the investigation, what the motive was, what the reasoning was,"" Capt. Ron Mead of the Washington State Patrol said at a news conference.
Seattle has been the site of protests for weeks since the killing of George Floyd on May 25 and the I-5 freeway had been shuttered due to protest-related activity.
Activists in the city briefly drove out cops from much of downtown to establish a police-free ""autonomous zone"" which swiftly became the site of much violence.
Protesters were driven out of the encampment this week.
It come as more than two dozen people were shot, two fatally, overnight in New York City on a violent July 4th weekend.
Nearly 30 people in total were shot but the NYPD wasn't able to immediately provide the exact number of shootings, the New York Post reported.
The July shootings come on the heels of a violent June in the city. 
With a total of 205 shootings during the month, it was the bloodiest June in 24 years - going back to 1996, when the NYPD logged 236 incidents, the NYPD said.
It comes as violence and protests, some of which descended into anarchy, gripped the nation in response to the murder of unarmed Black man George Floyd by police officers.
The most recent bloodshed occurred in Seattle when a car ploughed into protesters, hitting two young women and critically injuring them.
It has been reported that Summer Taylor, one of the women struck by the speeding car, has died from her injuries.
A group of people protesting in support of Black Lives Matter had peacefully gathered on a closed stretch of highway in Seattle on Saturday night when a car got onto the road and appeared to deliberately run down two of the activists. 
Taylor died from her injuries sustained in the hit and run, while the other person remains in serious condition in the ICU.
US President Donald Trump told Americans that the country was getting ready to fight its way out of the coronavirus pandemic at the end of an Independence Day marked by a sombre national mood and ongoing political protests.
In an online video message, Mr Trump said: ""We got hit with this terrible plague from China, and now we are getting close to fighting our way out of it."" 
But new virus data told a different story, with the daily infection rate hitting a new high of 57,683. More than 132,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since the first confirmed case in the US on January 21.
Mr Trump was also criticised for claiming, during a speech on the White House Lawn, that 99 per cent of coronavirus cases were ""totally harmless""
The President struck a more aggressive tone in a speech delivered earlier in the day at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, where he slammed ""cancel culture"" and ""left-wing fascism"".
In a wide-ranging 20-minute speech, Mr Trump condemned what he described as a ""merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children"". 
""This monument will never be desecrated,"" he said, referring to Mount Rushmore. 
""Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders and unleash violence in our cities,"" he said.
""They think the American people are weak and soft and submissive. But they don't know they are strong and won't allow its history and culture to be taken from them."" 
The Republican leader also took aim at the so-called ""cancel culture"" as a ""radical assault"" on America.
""There is a new far left fascism that demands absolute allegiance,"" he said.
""If you do not follow its commands you will be censored and punished. That's not going to happen to us.
""We will not be tyrannised. We will never surrender the spirit of July 4th 1776.""
Mr Trump's remarks were matched by equal passion on social media, with celebrities including Madonna, Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian making pointed political statements about the Black Lives Matter movement.
Usually a day of mass celebration, July 4 was a more subdued affair this year, with many Americans warned to stay home and keep celebrations small due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Beaches in California and Florida were closed as the states experienced big surges in new cases.
President Trump's July 4 celebrations were disrupted by protests and a positive coronavirus test for another member of the President's inner circle. 
Protesters blocked an access road to Mount Rushmore before he delivered his speech.
Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive for COVID-19 while in South Dakota. 
Guilfoyle, who has also acted as a fundraiser for President Trump, had been expected to attend the Mount Rushmore event.

However, Guilfoyle, who is asymptomatic, has not been in direct contact with the president and did not fly on Air Force One.
The protest group was mostly Native Americans protesting that South Dakota's Black Hills were taken from the Lakota people against treaty agreements. 
One group parked three vans across the road and took the tires from two of them to make it more difficult to remove them. Several demonstrators climbed on top of the vans chanting ""Land back!"" 
Police warned the protesters to disperse but didn't take any immediate action against them. 
The sheriff's office said attendees had been told to arrive early to avoid the roadblock. However, some motorists who had tickets for Friday evening's fireworks show were unable to get through the protests and were standing by their cars watching the standoff. 
Police in riot gear as well as members of the National Guard arrived on the scene and declared the group an unlawful assembly. 
Mr Trump's speech was followed by a firework display above the iconic monument. A reported 7000 tickets were distributed for the event, and South Dakota Republican Governor Kristi Noem promised social distancing guidelines would not be enforced.

It seems that the imam at Makkah Mosque in Leeds, Qari Asim MBE (yes, MBE, just like the Beatles), who is also a 'government adviser on Islamophobia,' claims that 'hate speech' has 'left scars' on members of his congregation. Yes, it's true: the poor lambs have been called rude names on the street. You thought you had it bad. 
The Post informs us that 'Leeds City Council research shows that Muslim people are most likely to be targeted by religiously-motivated hate crime than any other community in the city.' That hate crime apparently includes not just insults on the street, but on the interwebs as well: 'And online abuse can have an equally devastating impact on Muslims in Leeds, Imam Asim said, creating a sense of fear and dividing communities.' Imam Asim solemnly informed the world that 'I have personally experienced online abuse on a regular basis.' Even worse, 'Many of my congregation members have experienced anti-Muslim hatred: being called 'Bin Ladens', 'ISIS supporters', told to 'go back home'.' The noble Yorkshire Evening Post details the devastation this causes: 'Such anti-Muslim abuse has left scars on people and created a sense of fear not only for the victims but also families and friends.' There is no doubt about it whatsoever, and every decent person must say it loudly and without hesitation: it is very, very unkind of the people to call members of the Makkah Mosque rude names. It would be so nice if people didn't do that. And yet there are a few lingering questions. People are rude to one another all the time. Many people have been called unkind things on the street and online. Yet most of the time, there are no articles in any newspapers about this. Why is the situation different in the case of the Makkah Mosque? Well, that's obvious!, you will say. It's because the Post includes another salient detail: Muslims in the United Kingdom are not just called rude names, but brutalized: 'women have had scarves snatched in appalling attacks.' Well, that may be, although many such claims have turned out to have been false, notably that of Yasmin Seweid, who got international headlines for falsely claiming[3] that Trump supporters tore off her hijab in the New York subway. If this is really happening among the congregants of the Makkah Mosque, the perpetrators should be tried for assault in every case that such a prosecution is genuinely warranted. But the Yorkshire Evening Post article also makes a point it did not intend to make. Qari Asam is trying to show how bad Muslims have it in Britain, and all he can come up with are unkind words and unsupported claims that women have had their hijabs snatched off. Contrast that with the stories of Islamic jihad activity that we post here regularly. Which is more serious? Yet which gets more establishment media attention? The problem here is that the word 'Islamophobia' is used not just to refer to attacks of innocent Muslims, which are never justified, but also to honest and accurate analysis of how Islamic jihadis use the texts and teachings of Islam to justify violence. Is Qari Asim trying to silence such analysis by conflating it with the rude things his congregants have been called? Are insults really comparable to beheadings, suicide bombings, and the like? Yet all reporting on the latter is called 'Islamophobia' as much as the insults are. Qari Asim has unwittingly demonstrated that Muslims are not actually suffering in Britain any more than anyone else who has ever been called a rude name on the street or online. But actual vigilante attacks against innocent Muslims are so thin on the ground that this will have to do, and in any case it serves to further the Leftist/Islamic war against the freedom of speech.

42,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-09-25,"1426 words","NYREGION","Liam Stack and Joseph Goldstein",NA,"New York Threatens Orthodox Jewish Areas With Lockdown Over Virus",FALSE,"Community leaders said residents have resisted the rules in part because of the influence of President Trump, whose views on masks have been embraced.
Facing a worrying spike in coronavirus cases in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, New York City health officials began carrying out emergency inspections at private religious schools on Friday and threatened to impose an extraordinary lockdown in those communities that would be the first major retreat by the city on reopening since the pandemic began.
Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the Police Department and the Sheriff’s Office to enforce public health guidelines in several Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, where residents often do not wear masks or engage in social distancing. But community leaders said residents have been resisting the guidelines because of hostility toward Mr. de Blasio and the growing influence of President Trump, whose views on masks and the pandemic have been widely embraced.
The crackdown is occurring shortly before Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, which begins on Sunday night, and it was not immediately clear the impact that the measures might have on the ability of people to gather in synagogues. The Health Department said that if significant progress toward following guidelines did not occur by Monday, officials could issue fines, limit gatherings or force closings of businesses or schools.
“This may be the most precarious moment we are facing since we emerged from lockdown,” Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, the city’s health commissioner, said at a news conference in South Brooklyn.
Officials this week released statistics showing that the positivity rate in some Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods had grown to anywhere from 3 percent to 6 percent, significantly more than the city’s overall rate of between 1 percent and 2 percent. Officials are especially worried about the positivity rates in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Borough Park, Midwood and Gravesend, which they have referred to as the “Ocean Parkway Cluster.”
Mr. de Blasio said on Friday on The Brian Lehrer Show that the city had closed four yeshivas over violations of social distancing rules. 
“There’s a very rigorous outreach effort in the community in English and Yiddish,” the mayor said, adding, “There’s a substantial number of Yiddish speakers who have been brought into the effort. Test and Trace has been hiring directly from the community. We are going to keep doing that, though. I think this is an indicator we will be fighting for a little while here.”
The uptick in these neighborhoods amounts to the first major coronavirus challenge for the city after months of declining or flat infection rates. The concern now is that if the outbreak spreads further in the Orthodox community, it could begin to take hold elsewhere, with even more serious consequences. If the city’s overall positivity rate hits 3 percent, that would trigger a new lockdown, including the closing of public schools.
“In the absence of our doing the right thing, we will need to be in a lockdown-type situation as occurred in Israel,” Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of New York City Health and Hospitals, which is overseeing the city’s contact tracing program said earlier this week. He was referring to the decision by the Israeli government to reinstitute restrictions because the country is facing the highest rate of new cases per capita in the world.
The distrust of the authorities was on display during Friday’s news conference in South Brooklyn, at Gravesend Park, which was attended by several city health officials, when one man interrupted Dr. Katz by loudly saying the city had been exaggerating the severity of the outbreak. 
The scene grew tense when a second man, who was not wearing a mask, approached Dr. Katz, who told him to back off or put on a mask. The man shouted that he wouldn’t wear a mask and anyone who didn’t like it could leave.
“You don’t live here,” he shouted. “Get out of here.”
The man, who wouldn’t give his name, soon shouted a racial slur. He also began yelling, “Go to East New York,” a predominately Black neighborhood in Brooklyn.
Visits to Borough Park showed how the rules are often ignored. The coronavirus outbreak devastated New York’s Orthodox Jewish community in March and April, and community leaders say hundreds have died, including influential religious leaders. But this week, there was hardly a face mask in sight, as if the pandemic had never happened.
At a flower stand in Borough Park on Friday, a vendor, Boris Mushayev, tended to his merchandise as customers around him, all without masks, perused the white, red and orange blooms.
“You have some people here who wear masks but it is true that most people do not,” said Mr. Mushayev. “I think some people are just not so worried about the virus anymore. If customers want me to wear a mask I wear it, but for now I have to focus on work.”
Borough Park and Midwood were islands of support for President Trump during the 2016 election, when the president won 89 percent of the vote in one local precinct. Many there view him as an ally on issues like school choice, religious freedom and support for Israel, said Avi Greenstein, chief executive of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council.
Those political cross currents had made many here susceptible to “conflicting information from Washington, where we see a constant downplaying of the crisis and indoor rallies where people may or not be wearing masks,” Mr. Greenstein said.
He added that the political rift had been deepened by what he said were the de Blasio administration’s failures.
“For the city to make this deadline on the evening of Yom Kippur is shocking, and what is worse is community leaders found out about this on Thursday night from a press release,” said Mr. Greenstein. “That tells you everything you need to know about the story of Borough Park during the pandemic.”
Mr. Greenstein contrasted the mayor’s approach with a visit to his community center’s offices in January by Attorney General William P. Barr, who used the appearance at the venue to announce federal hate-crime charges against a Brooklyn woman accused of assaulting three Orthodox women last December.
“That sent a message to the community, to the entire neighborhood, very loud and clear: We’re here, we’re working with you,” he said. But when it comes to the coronavirus, he added, the neighborhood was facing a crisis of “tremendous uncertainty, a tremendous amount of misinformation and a lack of information.”
Yosef Rapaport, 66, a Yiddish podcaster whose brother and brother-in-law both died of Covid-19, said Mr. de Blasio needed to rebuild trust with a religious minority that has largely spurned his administration and aligned with President Trump.
“This community is being hit by a double whammy: the incompetence of City Hall and the ugliness that is coming from Washington,” Mr. Rapaport said. “There is a deep, deep mistrust among the community for the intentions of the mayor, especially when the president takes a different approach.”
Dr. Katz defended the city’s efforts, saying that it had made over 200,000 public health robocalls to neighborhoods with significant Orthodox Jewish populations and distributed tens of thousands of masks in Borough Park, Williamsburg, Brighton Beach and Flushing.
The city has also placed “nearly 60 newspaper ads in community papers to get the word out” among Hasidic Jews, he said, and talked to 20 synagogue leaders in Borough Park, a neighborhood with about 300 synagogues, according to Mr. Greenstein.
One lingering issue in the city’s relationship with Hasidic New Yorkers has been a late-night Twitter outburst by the mayor after he personally oversaw the dispersal of a rabbi’s funeral in Williamsburg in April. For many, it validated their fears about the city’s leadership.
Jacob Kornbluh, a Hasidic Jew who lives in Borough Park and writes for Jewish Insider, a national publication, summed up a perspective he often hears in the neighborhood: “De Blasio became the guy singling out the Jews so we don’t have to listen to him anymore.”
He added that when Mr. de Blasio failed to respond similarly to Black Lives Matter protests in June, it deepened people’s sense that the government was singling them out.
“Trump speaks their language: distrust in his own government that he leads, distrust in the media,” Mr. Kornbluh said.

(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)
Good morning.
We’re covering Moderna’s vaccine success, trouble for the European Union’s budget and monstrous robotic wolves on the Japanese island of Hokkaido.
Moderna’s vaccine shows success in trials
The drugmaker Moderna announced on Monday that its coronavirus vaccine was 94.5 percent effective, based on an early look at results from its large, continuing study.
Researchers said the results were better than they had dared to imagine. But though the company plans to apply for emergency authorization from the U.S. drug authorities within weeks, the vaccine will not be widely available for months.
The vaccine has a longer shelf life than previously reported: It can last 30 days in the refrigerator and 12 hours at room temperature, according to Moderna, potentially making it easier to store and use.
The race: Moderna’s announcement came a week after Pfizer reported that its vaccine, developed in collaboration with BioNTech, was more than 90 percent effective. Ten other companies are, like Moderna and Pfizer, conducting big Phase 3 trials, including efforts in China, Russia, India and Australia. Check our vaccine tracker here.
Markets: Global markets were up on Monday over news of both the Moderna vaccine and a new Asia-Pacific free trade deal.
Official remarks: “I had been saying I would be satisfied with a 75 percent effective vaccine,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. “Aspirationally, you would like to see 90, 95 percent, but I wasn’t expecting it. I thought we’d be good, but 94.5 percent is very impressive.”
Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.
In other coronavirus developments:
In Spain, a raft of lawsuits has emerged contending that the health care system’s struggle to fight the pandemic has led to neglect of other serious conditions, including treatment and diagnosis of cancer.
Japan became the latest major economy to bounce back from the devastation of the coronavirus, but the recovery is unlikely to be long-lived, analysts warn.
Tourism in New York Citywill need at least four years to recover from the free fall triggered by the pandemic, according to a new forecast from the city’s tourism promotion agency.
The E.U.’s budget on the line
In a move that threatens to derail the bloc’s long-term budget, Hungary and Poland blocked the European Union’s 750 billion euro — roughly $890 billion — coronavirus stimulus package, putting a total of 1.8 trillion euros on hold and wreaking havoc in the member states.
The two Eastern European countries said they would veto the spending bill because funding was conditioned on upholding rule-of-law standards, such as an independent judiciary, which the two governments have weakened as they have defiantly torn down separation of powers at home.
Their veto has thrown a signature achievement of the bloc into disarray, deepening a long-building standoff over its core principles and threatening to delay the stimulus money from getting to other member states, if a new agreement can be reached at all.
Brexit: Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s two-week quarantine comes at an inopportune moment for his negotiations with the bloc, with major issues still dividing the E.U. and Britain.
Moldova: Maia Sandu, a Harvard-educated economist who supports closer ties with the European Union, has won a presidential election in the former Soviet state against an incumbent endorsed by President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Biden warns of the risks of a rocky transition
President-elect Joe Biden, in his first economic address since winning the election, called on President Trump to begin the transition process promptly.
Mr. Biden spoke in favor of a national mask mandate and criticized the president and his advisers for attacking leaders of U.S. states that have imposed new restrictions to contain rising coronavirus case numbers. “What the hell’s the matter with these guys?” he said. “It’s totally irresponsible.”
His comments come at a critical time for the country’s economic recovery: Credit card data and other indicators suggest that consumers began to pull back spending this month as infection, hospitalization and death rates from the virus surged nationwide. Mr. Biden called on Congress to provide trillions of dollars in support to workers, businesses and state and local governments.
Quote: “More people may die, if we don’t coordinate,” Mr. Biden warned.

A remarkable Ironman journey
Earlier this month, Chris Nikic, above, became the first person with Down syndrome to conquer the grueling endurance race, encompassing a 2.4-mile open-water swim followed by a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run.
Over 16 hours 46 minutes and 9 seconds, Mr. Nikic, 21, battled dehydration, exhaustion and an unfortunate encounter with a mound of red ants in his attempt to complete the course. “I learned that there are no limits,” he told The Times. “Do not put a lid on me.”
Here’s what else is happening
‘English gentleman’: Despite increasing tense relations between Britain and China, Stephen Ellison, the British consul general in Chongqing, was hailed as a hero after a video of his rescue of a drowning woman from a river on Saturday went viral on Chinese social media.
Hate crime: The F.B.I. recorded more than 7,300 hate crimes in the United States last year, the highest number since 2008. The agency also recorded more murders motivated by hate than ever before, an increase largely driven by the August 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, in which 23 people died at a Walmart store.
Hurricane season: This year has seen 30 named storms — 13 of them hurricanes — breaking a record set in 2005, when 28 storms grew strong enough to be named. Hurricane Iota was expected to make landfall on the border of Nicaragua and Honduras on Monday night as a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest rating.
Monster robo-wolves: After wild bears kept venturing into a city on the Japanese island of Hokkaido in search of food, officials installed mechanical wolves with bared teeth, glowing red eyes and a selection of fearsome howls to keep the animals away.

And now for the Back Story on …
Different virus strategies in the U.S. and Europe
As the coronavirus has surged again in recent weeks, much of the U.S. has chosen to keep restaurants open and schools closed. Much of Europe has done the opposite.
The European approach seems to be working better: While both Europe and the U.S. have suffered surges in cases, over the past two weeks France, Germany, Spain and Britain have managed to reduce their growth rates.
What is Europe doing differently? It is cracking down on the kind of indoor gatherings that most commonly spread the virus. England closed pubs, restaurants, gyms and more on Nov. 5 and announced they would remain closed until at least Dec. 2. France, Germany’s regional governments and the Catalonia region of Spain have also shut restaurants, among other businesses.
Many Americans have resisted accepting that reality. Across much of the country, restaurants remain open for indoor dining. Last week, New York State announced a new policy that public health experts consider to be a bizarre middle ground: Businesses with a liquor license can stay open until 10 p.m.
The one indoor activity that appears to present less risk is school, especially elementary school. Why? Young children seem to spread the virus less often than adults do.
Closing schools and switching entirely to remote learning, on the other hand, has big social costs. Children are learning less, and many parents, mostly mothers, have dropped out of the labor force. The U.S. is suffering from both of these problems and from a raging pandemic.
That’s it for this briefing. See you tomorrow.

44,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times - International Edition",2020-07-09,"1502 words","US","Maggie Haberman",NA,"Trump Adds to Playbook of Stoking White Fear and Resentment",FALSE,"With a defense of Confederate flags and a false accusation against a Black NASCAR driver, Bubba Wallace, President Trump is focusing on racial and cultural flash points to appeal to his base.
President Trump mounted an explicit defense of the Confederate flag on Monday, suggesting that NASCAR had made a mistake in banning it from its auto racing events, while falsely accusing a top Black driver, Darrell Wallace Jr., of perpetrating a hoax involving a noose found in his garage.
The remarks are part of a pattern. Almost every day in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump has sought to stoke white fear and resentment, portraying himself as a protector of an old order that polls show much of America believes perpetuates entrenched racism and wants to move beyond. 
Two weeks ago, the president retweeted a video of a supporter shouting ""white power"" at a retirement community filled with older people whom he wants to win over. Last week, he wrote that he was reviewing a fair housing regulation that is aimed at eliminating racial housing disparities in the suburbs, but that he said would have a ""devastating impact"" on those communities - a play to white suburbanites whose votes would be crucial to his re-election.
On Monday, he also tweeted his displeasure with sports teams that are reviewing the appropriateness of nicknames that are offensive to Native Americans, seeking to curry favor with Americans who believe political correctness has gone too far. He has invoked fear of crime with tweets about sanctuary cities and crime rates in New York and Chicago, and has spoken of preserving ""our heritage,"" picking up the language of those who want to honor the Confederacy. 
For many Republicans who are watching the president's impact on Senate races with alarm, his focus on racial and cultural flash points - and not on the surge of the coronavirus in many states - is distressing. 
""This is part of the same selfish, divide-and-conquer strategy that helped the president get elected in 2016,"" said Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who has been critical of Mr. Trump. ""Of course that strategy worked for much of the president's base, and it certainly benefited him in the past, but it's selfish in the sense that it is extremely damaging for Republicans in swing states, in swing districts.""
Mr. Curbelo added, ""It's always been clear, but this is a reminder that the president looks out for himself first, second and third."" 
Mr. Trump's inflammatory behavior shows how out of step he is with shifting national sentiment on racial justice, as big corporations, sports leagues and cultural institutions express greater solidarity with Black Americans protesting systemic racism. Even some Republicans have been open to discussions about removing Confederate statues.
While NASCAR and other organizations have moved to retire symbols of the Confederacy, and lawmakers in Mississippi voted to bring down the state flag featuring the Confederate battle emblem, Mr. Trump continues to cast himself as a defender of the history of the American South, despite its stains of slavery and oppression. He has called the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" a ""symbol of hate,"" and he has repeatedly tried to depict pockets of violence during protests against entrenched racism as representative of the protest movement as a whole.
Mr. Trump also delivered official speeches over the weekend that emphasized defending American historical figures like George Washington and some abolitionists, though he avoided explicit references to totems of the Confederacy. 
But on Monday he was back invoking the Confederacy, with his reference to NASCAR's ban on Confederate flags, while also attacking Mr. Wallace, the only Black driver on NASCAR's top circuit.
Mr. Wallace, nicknamed ""Bubba,"" had called for NASCAR to ban the flag from its events, and the sport agreed to prohibit it from its races and its properties. At the start of race week at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama last month, a member of Mr. Wallace's racing team found a noose hanging in the driver's garage stall and reported it to NASCAR.
""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers &amp; officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, &amp; were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That &amp; Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!"" Mr. Trump posted on Twitter on Monday.
Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, offered a contorted defense of Mr. Trump's tweet about the Confederate flag and Mr. Wallace during an early afternoon briefing. 
She insisted Mr. Trump was being taken out of context, and invoked Jussie Smollet, the Black television actor known for his role on the TV series ""Empire,"" who is facing charges that he lied to the authorities about a hate crime attack that detectives said he had staged last year in Chicago. 
No one has credibly suggested Mr. Wallace manufactured the noose that was discovered in his garage stall by a colleague. F.B.I. officials later found that the knot had been tied into the rope as early as October 2019, well before anyone would have known that Mr. Wallace would be assigned that stall for the race.
Ms. McEnany claimed that the original reports about the incident painted NASCAR members as ""racist individuals who were roaming around and engaging in a crime.""
But Mr. Trump received pushback from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an informal adviser to the president, who said Monday that he disagreed with Mr. Trump's tweet.
""They're trying to grow the sport,"" Mr. Graham said, according to the CNN reporter Manu Raju, referring to NASCAR's ban on Confederate flags, which it announced last month. ""And I've lived in South Carolina all my life and if you're in business, the Confederate flag is not a good way to grow your business.""
Mr. Graham, who is facing a strong challenge from Jaime Harrison, a Black Democrat, in his re-election bid, said that ""one way you grow the sport is you take images that divide us and ask that they not be brought into the venue. That makes sense to me."" He said that Mr. Wallace did not have ""anything to apologize for,"" and that his fellow drivers should be applauded for supporting him.
""I would be looking to celebrate that kind of attitude more than being worried about it being a hoax,"" Mr. Graham said, according to Mr. Raju.
(Mr. Trump was also wrong in his tweet in characterizing NASCAR's television audience as having fallen to its ""lowest ratings EVER!"" The broadcast of Sunday's Brickyard 400 was seen by about 4.3 million viewers, a 39 percent increase from the average NASCAR race that aired on NBC last year, according to Nielsen.)
Later on Monday, Mr. Trump added another inflammatory tweet, weighing in on recent announcements by the Washington Redskins of the N.F.L. and the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball that the teams would review their names. While many Native Americans and other advocates for change consider the names deeply offensive, Mr. Trump baselessly claimed that Native Americans would be ""very angry"" about the potential changes.
""They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins &amp; Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. He added a jab at a favorite target, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has apologized for her past claims of Native ancestry. ""Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now,"" the president wrote.
Eleven minutes later, Mr. Trump again referred to the coronavirus as the ""China Virus,"" a phrase that critics say is racist, xenophobic and harmful to Asian-Americans.
Mr. Trump's tweets came just days after he delivered a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota as part of the July 4 holiday, in which he denounced Democrats as radical anarchists and said that children are taught in schools to ""hate"" the United States. In that address he avoided specifically mentioning anything related to Confederate monuments.
He talked more generally about efforts to take down statues across the country, conflating what is primarily an attempt to remove statues of Confederate generals with others questioning monuments to people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
""Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities,"" Mr. Trump said in the speech. ""Many of these people have no idea why they are doing this, but some know exactly what they are doing.""
Some of Mr. Trump's advisers have tried to persuade him to focus less explicitly on statues of Confederate generals, given that he is taking an unpopular position. But after sticking to the script in his Friday night speech, he was clear about his support for the Confederate flag in his tweet on Monday.

Kesha took to Instagram on Sunday evening with a stunning and fresh-faced selfie, including a heartfelt message of gratitude to those 'supporting survivors and telling their stories.'
Perhaps the TiK ToK singer, 33, was commenting on recent developments concerning the record producer she previously accused of sexual assault, Dr. Luke, who is nominated this year for another Grammy.

The post comes days after fellow musician Fiona Apple spoke out in support of Kesha, slamming the Recording Academy behind the Grammys for recognizing Dr. Luke for his work on Doja Cat's Say So.
In a recent interview with The Guardian, Apple slammed the Grammys for Luke's Record of the Year nomination, which he earned while working under the pseudonym Tyson Trax.
The producer - who's full name is Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald - has repeatedly denied Kesha's rape claims and sued the singer for defamation in 2014, a case which is still ongoing. 
Kesha accused Gottwald, 47, of sexual assault and emotional abuse and sued him for infliction of emotional distress and gender-based hate crimes. 
In her lawsuit, Kesha, who started working with the producer when she was 17, charged him with sexual assault and emotional abuse and sued him for infliction of emotional distress, gender-based hate crimes and employment discrimination.
He denied the allegations and claimed she smeared him with lies in hopes of getting out of her record contract.
Earlier this year, a New York judge ruled that Kesha defamed Dr. Luke with past text message to Lady Gaga, claiming he raped Katy Perry.
Kesha was ordered to pay $374K in late royalty payments in February, but her legal team said they planned to immediately appeal.
A number of high-profile artists - including Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Adele and Kelly Clarkson - have come out in support of Kesha.
Kesha's 2017 Grammy-nominated album Rainbow had many tracks that directly commented on her trauma, including the beautiful songs Learn To Let Go and Praying. "

A self-identified white supremacist pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal hate crime for plotting to bomb a Colorado synagogue in 2019, actions that federal officials said meet the federal definition of domestic terrorism. 
Richard Holzer, 28, pleaded guilty to two offenses: trying to obstruct people from exercising their religious beliefs by using force or explosives and trying to damage and destroy a building used in interstate commerce, according to the United States Attorney’s Office in Colorado. Each offense holds a maximum of 20 years in prison. However, according to plea agreement documents, prosecutors agreed not to recommend a sentence greater than 20 years. 
Mr. Holzer is set to be sentenced on Jan. 20. 
“This is the most important work that we can do — protecting our communities by stopping an attack before it occurred,” said Jason Dunn, U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado. “The people of Pueblo and the State of Colorado are safer as a result of today’s guilty plea and the outstanding work of prosecutors, the F.B.I., and our other law enforcement partners.”
Mr. Holzer’s arrest came a year after a gunman attacked congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue, shouting anti-Semitic slurs and killing 11 people. White supremacists were inspired by the attack, according to the Anti-Defamation League, and Jewish institutions were targeted on at least 50 occasions in the year after the Oct. 27, 2018, rampage. 
Mary Butterton, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Holzer, said she had no comment on the plea deal. 
In October 2019, Mr. Holzer told undercover F.B.I. agents that he planned to poison members of the Temple Emanuel Synagogue in Pueblo, Colo. — about 116 miles south of Denver — according to the plea agreement. Mr. Holzer used social media to promote white supremacy and communicate with people who were actually undercover law enforcement agents. 
In a meeting with undercover agents in late October, Mr. Holzer mentioned using explosives, including Molotov cocktails. Later he discussed using pipe bombs after visiting the synagogue and observing “that Molotov cocktails would not be enough to condemn the entire building.” He said that he wanted to get the synagogue “off the map,” federal officials said. 
On Nov. 1, undercover agents met up with Mr. Holzer, providing him with explosives, which he said were “absolutely gorgeous.” Mr. Holzer was later arrested. 
Temple Emanuel Synagogue, which is listed the National Register of Historic Places, says on its website that it is “the oldest Jewish house of worship in the Pueblo community.” 
Michael Atlas-Acuña, president of the synagogue’s board of directors, said Mr. Holzer’s plot was “a reality of today’s world.” 
After news of the plot was made public in 2019, the synagogue received overwhelming support nationally and outside the U.S., he said. Funds sent from supporters helped the synagogue ramp up security, financing a 24-hour surveillance system and an armed guard during services. 
“Out of a bad thing,” Mr. Atlas-Acuña said, “good things happen.”

May they rest in peace and may their memories be a blessing.
Erin Burnett OUTFRONT starts right now.
ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: OUTFRONT next, the breaking news, the nation's top doctors breaking publicly with the President on everything from testing to the severity of coronavirus itself. Dr. Anthony Fauci calling coronavirus a ""forest fire"".
President though in Arizona tonight with a crowd of thousands even as the state reopens with record high cases and deaths today. An ER doctor from Phoenix tells me he's seeing a surge and a big increase in young patients to the ER.
Also breaking, former President Obama in his first event with Joe Biden. We're going to hear from someone inside that private event. You'll hear what the President had to say. Let's go OUTFRONT.
And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.
OUTFRONT tonight, Trump against the doctors and it's now all out in the open, it's testing, it's masks, it's the virus itself. It's starting with testing. The President today says he wasn't kidding when he ordered or he said when he said he ordered officials to slow down testing. Here he is.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Were you just kidding or do you have a plan to slow down testing?
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't kid, because we're going to have more cases. By having more cases, it sounds bad. Here's what I say, testing is a double edged sword.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: At least he admits he wasn't kidding. We told he wasn't kidding last night, even though his own team, of course, said he was just joking in multiple television interviews on every single network, but he wasn't kidding. He thinks more testing is bad for him.
Now, of course, more testing does save lives and it will get the American economy back on track faster. And tonight, hours after the President said he wanted testing slowed down, his top doctor publicly, completely contradicted him.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: To my knowledge, none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing, so it's the opposite. We're going to be doing more testing, not less.
DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: We're continuing to try to enhance testing. It's a critical underpinning of our response.
ADMIRAL BRETT GIROIR, HHS ASSISTANT FOR HEALTH: My purpose in leading is to increase the number of testing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Increase. Testing needs to go up. It saves lives and it allows the economy to reopen. And here's the most important three words, stay that way. And more testing does not explain why there has been a rise in cases.
If you look at the facts, according to the Director of the CDC, one of the gentlemen you just saw there, Dr. Redfield, the country is now conducting five to 600,000 tests a day. And yet when you look at the chart, you could see the percentage of new cases is actually down significantly from a high of the pandemic when the United States was testing 150,000 people a day.
And hospitalizations are up in many states, including Texas where they are up 10 percent in a day. Dr. Fauci also sounding this alarm just a short time ago.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: The first thing that we would need to do is to try as best as possible to get the complete outbreak under control so that everything is at such a low level, that when there are cases that come up, you can contain them as opposed to mitigating we essentially chasing after a forest fire.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Chasing a forest fire. And yet days ago, the President seemed to suggest that that this was over, this was basically extinguished.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: If you look, the numbers are very miniscule compared to what it was. It's dying out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: OK, it's not dying out and the President surely knows that or at least he would if he listen to his doctors or how about this, actually even talked to his doctors. Because in a stunning exchange with lawmakers today, the members of the coronavirus task force, one after the other had this to say about the last time the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, spoke with them.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: About two and a half weeks ago.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was about two and a half weeks ago as well, maybe three weeks ago.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's been some time since I spoke about the pandemic response.
REDFIELD: As I mentioned before, the interactions and discussions I have with the President I'll keep to myself, but I do meet with the task force.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: Two and a half weeks ago. The President going it alone at a time when more than 120,000 Americans have already died from the virus. ICU admissions are surging in double digit number of states.
Erica Hill is OUTFRONT live in New York tonight. And Erica, the reality on the ground does not reflect what the President says it is.
ERICA HILL, CNN ANCHOR AND NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, it certainly doesn't. The reality on the ground is that the cases are not going away. This is not just appearing and a lack of testing would also not mean a lack of cases, as you know.
In fact, what we're seeing is not only a surge in the number of states, but we're seeing a significant increase when it comes to community spread.
[19:05:02]
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HILL (voice over): As more Americans leave strict shutdown measures behind, a stark warning that this freedom may be short lived.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we're seeing in Florida, in Texas, in Arizona and in other states.
(END VIDEO CLIP) HILL (voice over): A new daily high in Texas, cases topping 5,000 for the first time.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because the spread is so rapid right now, there's never a reason for you to have to leave your home.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HILL (voice over): Hospitalizations also spiking, up 177 percent in the last three weeks in Harris County. More than a third of all cases in California have come in just the past two weeks, Arizona announcing another daily high, nearly 3,600 new cases added on Tuesday, Florida not far behind.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're really in a worse place now than we were before.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HILL (voice over): Twenty-five states trending in the wrong direction over the past week, nearly the entire western half of the country.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REDFIELD: We've all done the best that we can do to tackle this virus and the reality that brought this nation to its knees.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HILL (voice over): More cities now mandating face coverings, but enforcing those rules at keeping people apart is proving difficult in some areas, especially among young people.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Don't be the knucklehead who ruins it for everyone else.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HILL (voice over): Twenty-two percent of the cases in New Jersey are an 18 to 29 year olds. That's up 10 percent since April.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The testing is increasing but the percentage of those people who are positive is actually going much higher. So it clearly is being transmitted at a high level in a number of places.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HILL (voice over): The University of Michigan scrapping plans to host a presidential debate this fall. Middlebury College will require students to quarantine at home for two weeks before arriving on campus and the EU considering a possible ban on travelers from the U.S. because we don't have the virus under control.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: If they're trying to prevent infections coming into their countries, America is going to be one of the top places that other countries are going to look to block in order to keep themselves safe.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HILL: One other thing to note, Dr. Robert Redfield also saying today that this virus, Erin, has highlighted the under investment over the span of decades in public health data and that is something that clearly needs attention.
BURNETT: All right. Erica, thank you very much. A sobering report there. I want to go to Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Dr. Jonathan Reiner who advise the White House medical team under President George W. Bush and of course directs the Cardiac Cath Lab at GW.
So Sanjay, the President, he's on an island here and you hear these doctors one after the other. They haven't talked to him in weeks. The President says it's dying out. The guy in charge of infectious diseases in the United States says if we don't get controlled it by fall, we're essentially chasing after a forest fire. It should serve all of us to hear these messages be so polar opposite.
SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, there's no question. I mean, the public health community has been pretty consistent on this and look the numbers don't lie. We know that it's not dying out. It is a message that we've heard from this president since the beginning.
I remember I was at that White House press conference where he said there's 15 people, it'll be zero by next week and it's been sort of consistent in terms of how he's talked about this. But the numbers don't lie and I think that the idea that you suggest test less and therefore the problem will go away, obviously, reflects a lack of understanding or a lack of wanting to understand the problem.
If you test more, if you test at the right amount, the number should come down and that's what's happened in many places around the world where they've had adequate testing, they've been able to bring these numbers down. We're in a little bit of a tough spot right now as Tony Fauci described it, we're getting hit hard right now with these numbers and I don't know how you actually bring him down unless you start implementing some of these basic public health measures.
BURNETT: Right. And they're surging in some of these states as he mentioned, Florida, Texas, Arizona, among others. I mean, Dr. Reiner, the President was clear today. He said at that rally right that he told everyone to slow down the testing and so then all of the President's troops went out on national television and said he was just joking. He was just joking.
So then today he says he wasn't joking. But the people who are in charge when they were asked today, were you told to slow trusting down, they were adamant that they hadn't. Here they are.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, sir.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, Congressman.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: So that's good. He didn't actually do it. He said he did it, he then lied about it and today said he did it again. They haven't talked to him in weeks. How do you put all of this together?
JONATHAN REINER, DIRECTOR OF CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: Well, the President of the United States doesn't believe, apparently, in the two pillars of our pandemic response.
[19:10:06]
The need to test and the need to wear face masks. The President all along has doubted the necessity of testing. He didn't want the passengers from the Grand Princess to come to the United States because it would drive the numbers up. He said that testing is overrated.
And today, what he said basically is when we test we just find some people who don't have illness or they're asymptomatic. What he doesn't understand is that that's how we extinguish the virus. That's how you get people to quarantine. We contact trace their contacts, they stay home. That's how you drop the transmission of the virus.
By the same token, he doesn't believe in face masks and we know now with certainty that that's the principal way we prevent person to person transmission outside the home. So how is it that our chief pandemic officer, the President of the United States doesn't believe in the two most effective tools to put in the pandemic down.
It's either that he doesn't understand which raises unfathomable cognitive questions or he's trying to promote a false narrative that everything is fine and we all have our heads in the sand.
BURNETT: So Dr. Sanjay, I'm just going to give you a chance in the context of what Dr. Reiner just said, right, which is - the whole point is that you need to test asymptomatic people to find out where it's spreading in the community and who's going to get it, who could become very ill or die. Can you explain to people why this is so important, because I think we've all heard from a lot of people now who say, well, what's the problem with the young people just going out, they're not going to get it that badly, they're not going to die, why can't they continue with their college life and their life and the people who need to stay home stay home.
And there is a chorus of this and in a sense that's what's the president is reflecting. Why is that wrong, Sanjay?
GUPTA: Yes. This is a really fundamental point. I'm glad you're raising it. I mean, the concern is that this is a very contagious virus and even people who aren't having symptoms or who don't yet have symptoms can spread it. That is the whole term, asymptomatic spread, or pre symptomatic spread. And we know that that can be concerning.
We don't know how big a driver of the overall infection rate that is, but it clearly happens. So this idea that - there's two things, one is that younger people are far less likely to get sick. We know that, but they can get sick. So there's still a risk there and the question is always going to become how much are you willing to accept in terms of risk.
But the other part of this is that they can then spread it to people who are vulnerable. And by the way, elderly people and people with pre existing condition is vulnerable. But let's say I got a kid who's at home getting chemotherapy for something, you spread it to me and then I spread it to the kid. The point is that you don't know where the volume abilities lie.
So what has happened in many places around the world is you try and really reduce the infection spread, because that is how you, as Dr. Reiner said, that's how you ultimately are going to extinguish this. We don't have a vaccine yet.
We don't have a magic therapeutic yet. Yet these countries around the world have been able to bring this down among asymptomatic and symptomatic people, because of testing, because of face masks, because of physical distancing, bread and butter stuff. It works.
BURNETT: Yes. Well, thank you both very much. So it's just another reason why it confounds me that people don't understand how wearing masks can actually get this economy open and keep it that way. It's the most basic thing and it enables our economic freedom. It does not curtail it. Thank you, both so very much.
And next, President Trump holding an event in Phoenix right now, early pictures showing very little social distancing, few if any masks in that room, which is happening right now.
Plus, what the FBI is now saying about an alleged noose found in the garage of NASCAR's only top black driver. This is a very big development tonight.
And tennis star Novak Djokovic who you can see here dancing during the limbo now says he is sorry after he has tested positive for coronavirus.
[19:17:53]
BURNETT: Breaking news, these are live pictures out of Arizona. President Trump is speaking at the students for Trump event in Phoenix amid the surge of coronavirus cases in the state of Arizona. Today Arizona reported nearly 3,600 new cases, more than 2,100 new hospitalizations and 42 deaths. These are all single day records for the State of Arizona.
Just moments ago, the President on that podium with thousands in the room repeated the use of a racist expression to talk about the virus.
And Ryan Nobles is OUTFRONT in Phoenix. Ryan, he just referred to it as the kung flu, using the word kung flu twice where you are. The President also saying the plague is going away as he again uses that racially loaded term. What are you seeing there in terms of social distancing, masks, it looks pretty crowded?
RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Not a lot, Erin. In fact, hardly any at all. And this despite the fact that the City of Phoenix, its city council and its Mayor passed an ordinance this week specifically requiring anyone in a room like this within six feet of someone to have a mask on. The President doesn't have a mask on, very few if any people in the crowd have masks on. They also did not test temperatures on their way in and there is very little social distancing, so it's interesting.
I should point out, Erin, that the Governor of Arizona is here and he actually has a mask on so Erin.
BURNETT: Wow, that's very interesting. All right. Ryan, thank you very much. Everyone, you can see that room, an interesting - Gov. Ducey is wearing a mask and those who have been following this have noticed obviously, recently, he was refusing to wear one and then recently started appearing with one as he encouraged people in the state to wear them even though he would not give a Governor mandated order that people wear them.
But you see that room. There's no social distancing and very few if any masks. No temperature is taken on the way in.
OUTFRONT now, Dr. Murtaza Akhter. He has been treating coronavirus patients on a daily basis in the ER of hospital in Phoenix. Dr. Akhter, when you see what we just saw there, it's in Phoenix, in your state and it's a room of thousands of people and they're not socially distancing and almost no one is wearing a mask. President isn't wearing a mask.
[19:20:03]
You're going in the ER every day, what goes through your head when you see this? DR. MURTAZA AKHTER, E.R. DOCTOR, VALLEYWISE HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER: A scene like that is really upsetting. I consider myself lucky that you guys have blacked out the screen for me, because I'd be really upset if I actually saw this happen. But this is what we expected is that people go to this rally, not wear masks and in particular not distance.
It is impossible to not spread an infection if you're not distancing, impossible and to do this during a pandemic is irresponsible putting it lightly. It's very dangerous.
BURNETT: So when we look at the numbers that I just shared in terms of new cases, in terms of hospitalizations and in terms of death, a record in each of those three where you are tonight, what are you seeing at your hospital doctor, Dr. Akhter?
AKHTER: Erin, I think we're going to keep breaking records and this isn't the kind of record you want to break. The cases are surging and people try claiming that it's because we're doing more testing, but if we were doing more testing, not only with positives increase but so are the negatives, especially as we're doing more widespread testing of less symptomatic people.
But instead, our percent, our fraction of positive cases increasing and increasing rapidly. And I'm seeing in the ER there are a lot more patients just a few weeks ago, a lot of them have what we call influenza-like illness. And basically everybody in testing is coming back positive for COVID. These are like preposterous numbers.
So, again, my experience is anecdotal, but it matches up with the state data. I'm concerned it's only getting worse and keep in mind that even once we plateau, which we're not even close to, in my opinion, but even once we plateau, the actual sickness, the compensation of the patients may happen a couple weeks later. So I think the worst of it is yet to come. That's the scary part.
BURNETT: And who are you seeing coming into the ER? Have you seen some shifts?
AKHTER: One of the things about the virus is unlike humans, the virus isn't racist or gender preference. It hits everyone, whatever age, whatever gender, whatever race. Now, there are certain groups that are more at risk. And the reason I bring this up is because in Arizona it's particularly important where we have a lot of retirees and a lot of snowbirds.
People in Arizona who are 65 and above and if they have COVID have a 58 times more likely chance of dying from it than somebody who's 45 or under, 58 times more likely. So as Dr. Gupta mentioned earlier, even if you think you're young, healthy and immune, for one, it's not exactly a good assessment, because I'm seeing young healthy patients who are coming in very sick.
But two, they can spread it to people who are at risk, whether immunocompromised or elderly or a plethora of patients, and we have a lot of those elderly patients here in Arizona, it's really concerning. I'm seeing all of them. And then obviously, the older ones even more likely to die, which is really, really upsetting.
BURNETT: So the President is holding the rally in this church, where he's got thousands of people. And the leaders of the church, the President said in an interview he had - I'm sorry, the leaders of the church said in a video on Facebook yesterday that they had a unique air filtration system, Dr. Akhter, that would kill they said 99.9 percent of COVID within 10 minutes. So when you come in our auditorium, 99 percent of COVID is gone, killed if it was there in the first place. You can know when you come here, you'll be safe.
They did pull that video down. The company that does the HVAC says that they have never heard of such a thing. But what do you make of that? These are the leaders of this institution telling people it's 99.9 percent safe.
AKHTER: Yes. That's upsetting on so many levels. As a physician, as a researcher, as somebody who's gone to the company's website where they said 99.9, but didn't have any research to back it up. Remember, they used a surrogate measure, they didn't actually use COVID in patients. They would need a big patient population to be able to prove that they never have.
And even if it were 99.9 percent effective, nothing about filtration is a novel first of all. OK, we've been filtering the air for years. But even if it were that effective, the only way it would work is if I'm standing a hundred feet from you and that if I cough or laugh, hopefully the filtration system picks it up between the hundred feet between me and you. But that rally is not a separation of a hundred feet. It's not even six feet.
So if somebody laughs and has COVID, the person next to him who catches that laugh now is sick. There's no way for this filtration system to magically like Star Wars zap it out.
BURNETT: No. They're not even one foot away and we could hear them chanting. They are using their respiratory systems. Thank you very much.
AKHTER: Oh, they're definitely based on what I'm hearing. Yes, it's very concerning.
BURNETT: Well, Doctor, I appreciate your time. I do, I know our viewers do as well and we wish you the best as we know what you are fighting right now. Thank you.
AKHTER: Thank you, Erin. Stay safe and thank you for spreading the message.
BURNETT: All right. And next, the breaking news, the FBI with a big update about the NASCAR's only top black driver and what appear to be a noose found in his garage.
Plus, Obama teaming up with Biden for the first time this year telling supporters they have a lot more work to do. We got video from this. It's the first time they've teamed up this year and someone who was there at the event and you'll hear what the former President had to say.
[19:28:56]
BURNETT: Breaking news, the FBI saying the noose found in a NASCAR garage not a hate crime against Bubba Wallace. The only black racer on NASCAR's top circuit.
Alexandra Field is OUTFRONT. So Alexandra, this is a headline, of course, everybody is now trying to find out what happened here. What did the FBI find?
ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Erin. They dispatched 15 FBI special agents who say there was no evidence at all of any intentional racist act, no evidence of a hate crime, no evidence even that Bubba Wallace had been targeted. NASCAR explains it this way saying that the FBI report concludes and photographic evidence confirms that the garage door pole rope fashion like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall. This was obviously well before the 43 team's arrival and garage assignment.
Therefore, no charges in this case. This is the end of it. The investigation now concludes. Of course, this comes after the NASCAR community, other drivers had rallied around Wallace. The discovery of this apparent news had come after Wallace had called on NASCAR to ban the presence of confederate flags at their events. NASCAR quickly followed suit.
[19:30:00]
Wallace, of course, had also recently been seeing debuting a car with the words Black Lives Matter emblazoned on it and he's certainly been at the race track wearing a ""I can't breathe"" shirt.
So, he's gotten an outpouring of support for the community. But the final word on this investigation is that no crime was committed, again a garage door pull broke apparently fashioned as that noose.
BURNETT: All right. And it had been there before anyone who would have known he was in that garage.
All right. Alexandra, thank you very much. Obviously, really good news that wasn't what it appeared to be and really good news, of course, that the community had rallied so strongly behind Mr. Wallace.
This comes as friends and family today say their final goodbyes to Rayshard Brooks, the black man shot and killed by Atlanta police officers in the Wendy's parking lot.
Ryan Young is OUTFRONT.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
RYAN YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A somber scene as Rayshard Brooks is laid to rest. Hundreds filled Ebenezer Baptist Church to pay respects to the man shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer earlier this month.
AMBREA MIKOLAJCZYK, COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND OF RAYSHARD BROOKS: He radiated such a bright right that regardless of the cowardly act that took his life, his light will never be dim.
YOUNG: It was an emotional afternoon commemorating the life of the 27- year-old father.
JYMACO BROOKS, COUSIN OF RAYSHARD BROOKS: This is the family we come from. We didn't have a lot of anything, but we had a whole lot of love for each other.
YOUNG: And providing a backdrop for a larger conversation on racism.
REV. DR. BERNICE A. KING, CEO, THE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. CENTER FOR NONVIOLENT SOCIAL CHANGE: This time the answer is not more diversity and inclusion. It's now time for Black Lives Matter.
PROTESTERS: Hands up, don't shoot! Hands up, don't shoot!
YOUNG: Brooks death comes during nationwide protests against systematic racism and police brutality, and less than a month after George Floyd died in the custody of the Minneapolis police.
REV. RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK, SENIOR PASTOR, EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH: George Floyd complied, Rayshard Brooks ran, yes, that's true. But they are both dead. And therein is the problem.
YOUNG: brooks was shot in the back by Officer Garrett Rolfe, one of the officers who responded to a call of a man asleep in his car at a Wendy's parking lot. Video of the incident shows him running away after resisting arrest and grabbing one of the officer's Tasers.
Rolfe is facing a felony murder charge. He says he heard a gunshot and saw a flash and fired his weapon fearing for his safety. Officer Devin Brosnan is charged with aggravated assault telling ""The Atlanta Journal of Constitution"" he would not have done anything different that night.
I have 100 percent faith the truth will come out. People will see this for what it is. They will understand I didn't do anything wrong.
But for many, the circumstances surrounding Brooks' death are a symptom of a larger problem.
GABRIEL MARTINI, FRIEND OF RAYSHARD BROOKS: No matter the race, let's treat each other how we wanted to be treated as people. Let's love everyone and fight for everyone's rights.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
YOUNG: Erin, if you think about this the most powerful voice today was the voice of the youth. That young lady spoke so much power into that room, so many people crying. When you think about this, brooks leaves behind three daughters, 8, 2 and 1 and you have a stepson he had. A lot of people are focused on the young people and what they felt moving forward. It was a tough day especially inside that church -- Erin.
BURNETT: All right. Ryan, thank you.
And next, I want to go to Reverend Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church. You just heard him in Ryan's piece delivering the eulogy.
And, Reverend, I appreciate your time. I mean, you know, watching you today, you've said that you have had to give these kinds of speeches far too often and yet you then said you hadn't lost hope. How come?
REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, SENIOR PASTOR, EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH: Oh, we can't afford to lose hope. We have to keep fighting the good fight. And although it is a dark and difficult moment, I think that there are good reasons to have hope. And I'm inspired by the young people that Ryan and others referenced.
We are seeing an amazing coalition of conscience marching out on to American streets demanding that our country do better and that it rises up to its high idealism. And I'm encouraged.
I think that we will continue to see this kind of activism throughout the summer, and I'm hopeful then that it will translate into voting in November. That is a sure way of pushing forward meaningful change.
BURNETT: You know, as you know, a lot of people have tried to understand what happened there, and no one truly does yet. One thing we keep hearing about is that this had been peaceful for almost half an hour, right? Everybody had -- the officers and Mr. Brooks. And then suddenly Mr. Brooks runs away from police.
[19:35:01]
And in your eulogy, you said you understood why. Here is part of how you explain it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WARNOCK: If your skin is the weapon and your complexion is the crime, what do you do to stay alive? Comply like George Floyd or run like Rayshard Brooks? I'm not asking for a friend. I'm asking for myself.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: It's deeply personal for you.
WARNOCK: It is. I grew up in public housing down in Savannah, Georgia, and I spend a lot of time now as a pastor in the community and just moving around as an African-American man myself. I know what it's like to be marched through a grocery store as a teenager accused of shoplifting simply because I had my hands in my pocket. You know, it was a chilly day and marched through the grocery store and then released without an apology. I know that pain and that humiliation.
And we're seeing these kinds of things show up in every day -- this is part of everyday African-American life. But in recent days, we're seeing a public conversation about it across races and I think that's important to help (ph) -- important.
BURNETT: So, you know, you talk about the protesters and your hopes this will continue through the summer and there will be real change. You know, the president came out today with retweeting a video appearing to show a black man harassing a white man. His comment was look what's going on here. Where are the protesters? He then retweeted another account linking to a clip of a black man pushing a white woman into the side of a subway car asking, quote, where are the protests for this?
What do you say to the president and those images, Reverend?
WARNOCK: He is the divider in chief. He is engaged in the politics of division because he has no vision.
And what we have to do is we have to rise above those who engage in looting and those who tweet about shooting as the president did a few weeks ago. He hasn't been helpful and I've long lost any expectation that he would be helpful.
The truth is we've been dealing with these issues before Donald Trump was president. We as a nation have to look deeply inward. This is an inflection point. I think some issues are coming to the surface that have always been there. But thanks to cell phones and cameras everywhere, people are beginning to see it and I'm encouraged by the response that we're seeing in the streets and also at the ballot box.
Last Tuesday, we saw an amazing turnout in the Georgia primary that surpassed 2016. I think there's a lot of passion out there and commitment. And the more people participate, the healthier our democracy.
BURNETT: Well, Reverend, I appreciate your time and I thank you very much. You know, as you mentioned, the ballot box, it is election night now in two key states.
And these are really big races to watch. There could be big upsets in both. We're going to talk about that after a break.
And former President Obama returning to the campaign trail appearing with Joe Biden for the first time.

BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: There's nobody I trust more to be able to heal this country and get it back on track than my dear friend Joe Biden.

[19:42:31]
BURNETT: Tonight, we're watching two major races in Kentucky. Voters are deciding who is going to take on the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
And in New York, a powerful committee chairman could lose the seat he has held for more than 30 years after an embarrassing hot mic moment.
The national reckoning on race is front and center in both primaries.
Jeff Zeleny is OUTFRONT.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On that much, Democrats agree. But as voters cast ballots today in Kentucky, they're divided over what kind of Democrat that should be.
AMY MCGRATH (D), KENTUCKY SENATORIAL CANDIDATE: Get rid of Senator Mitch McConnell.
ZELENY: Amy McGrath is the favorite of the Washington Party establishment, but the decision is now in the hands of Kentucky voters.
STATE REP. CHARLES BOOKER (D-KY), U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE: We're going to win this race.
ZELENY: But State Representative Charles Booker insisting that a progressive candidate stands a better chance of defeating Mitch McConnell.
BOOKER: There is a mountain that's blocking your progress and that mountain is Mitch McConnell.
ZELENY: On another day of voting in America, a national reckoning on race is being felt across the political landscape with establishment figures suddenly on edge, the Senate primary in Kentucky and congressional one in New York are the latest signs the ideological tug of war is still very much alive inside the Democratic Party.
JAMAAL BOWMAN (D), NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: It's time for a change.
ZELENY: Jamaal Bowman, a Bronx middle school principal, mounting a challenge today against Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He's been in office for three decades.
Protests over racial justice and police brutality are now a central part of political reality too. In Kentucky, Booker's candidacy gained momentum after joining the protests after the killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor, an EMT, in March.
BOOKER: I think people are more aware of how interconnected we are. I think they're more ready to receive the truth that injustice is pervasive and that structural racism is real.
ZELENY: And Bowman getting a serious look after Engel was caught at a hot mic addressing the protests following the death of George Floyd.
REP. ELIOT ENGEL (D-NY): If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care.
ZELENY: But Bowman and Booker won the backing of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and they're pushing the Democratic Party for bolder change.
Engel is supported by Hillary Clinton and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and McGrath by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.
While the primary campaigns end today, voting in the age of pandemic requires patience. Neither Kentucky nor New York plans to release full results tonight.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
[19:45:04]
ZELENY: Now, Kentucky's Secretary of State Michael Adams told me today that he believes this will be a record setting turnout for a primary election largely because of absentee ballots and vote by mail. Now, that did not stop a bit of commotion here moments before the polls were closing and after. There were a few hundred people standing here behind me banging on the doors to be allowed to come in. A judge ruled that the polls should stay open 30 more minutes here just at this one location.
But, Erin, we will have the final results of this probably not until a week. But voting in the age of a pandemic, certainly so different when all emotions certainly are so high, Erin.
BURNETT: Yes. All right. Jeff, thank you very much.
Crucial races to watch and watch how they're executed.
OUTFRONT next, Barack Obama back on the trail for the first time this election with Joe Biden.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: This is serious business. Whatever you've done so far is not enough.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: And tennis star Novak Djokovic who wasn't social distancing now has coronavirus. He's speaking out tonight.
[19:50:13]
BURNETT: New tonight, the number one ranked tennis player in the entire world, Novak Djokovic, and his wife both self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus. This after he organized, he played in a series of tennis matches, ignored social distancing guidelines and he opposed taking a potential vaccine.
Christina Macfarlane is OUTFRONT.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When you're the world tennis champion, you don't want to be in the news for limbo dancing in a crowded nightclub but that's where Djokovic finds himself today testing positive for coronavirus after organizing a tournament that was meant to ease tennis out of lockdown. He said profits were supposed to be for people in need. Instead, it's led to Djokovic, his wife and three other players testing positive for COVID- 19.
In a statement, Djokovic said he organized the tournament because he thought he met all health guidelines and the virus was weakening.
He said: I can't express enough how sorry I am for this and every case of infection. Everything the organizers and I did in the past month we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions. We were wrong and it was too soon.
Around the tournament, the players high-fived and hugged and played basketball and football awaiting the court and then the nightclub visit.
Thousands of fans packed the event to see live tennis, with limited social distancing in place.
But this isn't the first time tennis is men's number one faced criticism for his views on the virus. In April, he said he was against the idea of being made to take a vaccine for COVID-19 in order to travel and compete in the future.
He said in a statement: I am no expert but I do want to have an opinion to choose what's best for my body. I'm keeping an open mind.
Now, a scandal that started in the Balkans could hugely impact plans for this year's U.S. Open which only announced it was going ahead next week. Players already weighing up competing in New York under new limits on where they can stay and who they can see.
But now that Djokovic is in self-isolation for 14 days, not the roaring return for tennis anyone thought.
Christina Macfarlane, CNN, London.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
BURNETT: And OUTFRONT next, President Obama appearing with Joe Biden for the first time during this election. I'm going to speak to someone who is at this event and knows them both well, next.
[19:55:44]
BURNETT: Breaking news, Barack Obama and Joe Biden appearing together for the first time this election. It's a virtual fundraiser just wrapping up moments ago where President Obama made a pitch why he believes Joe Biden should be the next president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: Help is on the way, if we do the work because there is nobody that I trust more to be able to heal this country and get it back on track than my dear friend Joe Biden.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: OUTFRONT now, Terry McAuliffe, former governor of Virginia, former chairman of the DNC, attending that fundraiser that ended just moments ago.
And, I know, Governor, you know both of them.
So, this is the first time they've appeared together this election. I know President Obama obviously waited to weigh in until the primaries were settled and now you've got coronavirus, but why did it take so long?
TERRY MCAULIFFE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, listen, I don't think it took long. I remind you that Joe Biden has wrapped up his nomination earlier than we've ever seen since 2004 and now we're beginning to layout the building blocks for the general election. This was a perfect time for President Obama to come out.
They had 175,000 people on the call. They raised about $7.6 million.
And, Erin, contrast that with Donald Trump who is out in Arizona. The state that had -- today has the highest level of COVID cases that it's ever had, he's out there putting all of his supporters in jeopardy. I mean, it's a public health threat, and the vice president and President Obama were doing the right thing today, talking to folks about character, honesty, what we need in the new government with Joe Biden and the White House.
BURNETT: So, interesting, you're saying 175,000 people on that call, $7.6 million raised.
MCAULIFFE: Yes.
BURNETT: Obviously, that's a significant number -- on both counts.
And -- but, you know, President Obama doesn't do a lot of these things. It's a rare political appearance for him. You know, at one point he linked nationwide protest to an opportunity to make real change in the country. He says if people vote for Biden.
Let me just play that clip for you, Governor, that you heard, so or viewers can.
MCAULIFFE: Sure, yeah.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: This is serious business. Whatever you've done so far is not enough and I hold myself and Michelle and our kids to that same standard. We have this unique chance to translate a growing awareness of injustice in this society into actual legislation and institutional change that can make a difference in people's lives and those moments don't come that often.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BURNETT: So, Governor, you know him. When he says moments don't come that often, that this is a unique chance and how he thinks the situation now is more difficult than the one he inherited in the midst of a very, very deep recession, right, when there was fear there wouldn't be money in ATMs.
MCAULIFFE: Yes.
BURNETT: Right? We remember those moments.
Does this mean we're going to see a lot more Barack Obama and he mentions her and his children, Michelle Obama, on the campaign trail?
MCAULIFFE: Yes, there are going to be more on the campaign trail. Both are beloved in our party. You know, I think when President Obama and Michelle Obama, when they came and campaigned for me down in Virginia, there is nobody more popular to come in, motivate the base but to really layout the reasoning why Joe Biden, he and president Obama did that on the call today -- the honesty, the character.
He went very aggressively against Trump today on this call, talked about Trump, you know, not believing the science, and he really laid out the difference between a Biden presidency and what we have with Donald Trump today, and he was very aggressive on that and we need him to do it through the rest of the whole campaign trail.
But, you know, the stakes are so large and so important. In the beginning of the call, which was interesting, Jen O'Malley, the campaign manager, talked about the map a little bit, talked about Arizona.
Erin, Democrats have only won Arizona once since 1950. It is in play. That is why Donald Trump today is in Arizona.
Why is he campaigning there? Because he's in trouble.
And that's the point when Joe Biden won those primaries and I said on your show many times, I'm looking for a Democrat who can expand the electorate.
Joe Biden has done that and he's going to be able to reach out to independents, to reasonable Republicans to motivate the Democrats. He is expanding the base of this upcoming election.
BURNETT: All right. Well, Governor McAuliffe, I appreciate your time. Thank you very much, sir.
MCAULIFFE: Thanks, Erin. You bet. Thank you.
BURNETT: All right. And let's hand it off now to Anderson."

MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In terms of newly- confirmed cases in a 24-hour period, Mexico, for the first time, reporting more than 6,000 cases in a single day. That brings the overall total to more than 191,000 confirmed cases. We're expecting that number to cross 200,000 cases in the coming days.
And in some non-coronavirus-related news, we heard from President Trump on Tuesday, who said he expects Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to visit the White House, quote, ""soon."" That would be the first time the Mexican president has left this country since taking office roughly 1 1/2 years ago -- Laura.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
LAURA JARRETT, CNN ANCHOR: Matt Rivers in Mexico City for us. Thank you so much for that.
EARLY START continues right now.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we're seeing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Health officials pleading with Americans to help slow coronavirus. More states now mandating masks even though the president refuses to wear one.
Well, the message is stay out. The European Union could block all travelers from the U.S. to keep the virus out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BUBBA WALLACE, NASCAR DRIVER: I'm pissed. I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am. (END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Bubba Wallace has some pretty serious questions after the FBI said the noose found in his garage at Talladega was not a hate crime.
Good morning, this is EARLY START. I'm Laura Jarrett. About 31 minutes past the hour here in New York.
And the U.S. this morning is entering a critical phase in the fight to slow coronavirus. There are now 26 states headed in the wrong direction -- a count that keeps ticking up day-by-day, including new case records in California and Texas, the most populous states in the nation.
The government's leading voice on the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, telling a House committee he's worried about complacency and that the curve that Americans tried so hard to flatten is now rising sharply again.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FAUCI: And we're now seeing a disturbing surge of infections that looks like it's a combination. But one of the things is an increase in community spread.
We were going down from 30,000 to 25,000 to 20,000 and now we sort of stayed about flat. And now, we're going up. A couple of days ago there were 30,000 new infections. That's very troublesome to me.
The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we're seeing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Fauci is pleading for people to avoid crowds and just wear masks, just hours before President Trump shunned a mask and addressed a packed crowd of his young supporters in Arizona. That state setting another record for new cases yesterday. Positive tests, a real indicator of spread, have tripled in Arizona since Memorial Day.
Meanwhile in Florida, the ""Miami Herald"" reports record numbers of patients with Covid-19 are filling hospitals in Miami-Dade County. One medical center in Homestead has reached ICU capacity. There's been a huge jump in the number of Covid cases and critically, in the percentage of tests coming back positive -- upwards of 15 percent, recently there.
Florida businesses, meanwhile, remain open but Gov. Ron DeSantis is threatening to pull the plug on establishments that don't follow social distancing rules.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): If people see a pub or restaurant -- you know, if they're operating at 55 percent, OK, give them a warning. Tell them hey, 50. But if you go in and it's just like mayhem -- like ""DANCE PARTY USA"" and it's packed to the rafters, that's just cut and dry and that's not just an innocent mistake.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: True to that threat, an Orlando area bar near the University of Florida has had its liquor license suspended after 13 patrons and 28 employees tested positive for the virus.
Similar issues are cropping up all over the country now. CNN's Erica Hill has more on all that.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ERICA HILL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning.
Some sobering new records being set in Arizona and Texas on Tuesday. Record single-day highs for new cases and in Texas, a record, too, for hospitalizations. Harris County, which is home to Houston, really seeing a spike there. In fact, Texas Children's Hospital said it's now admitting adults to deal with the surge.
Gov. Abbott, in Texas, warning the safest place for people to be is in their homes, and that if this surge continues they may have to bring back some restrictions.
Meantime, 17 high-schoolers in Ohio who took a trip to Myrtle Beach have now tested positive. While none of them have been hospitalized, local health officials say they're concerned about the spread.
In Tennessee, half of all the new cases have been linked to community spread. And in Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee, on Tuesday afternoon, announcing that as of Friday, everyone in the state needs to wear a face-covering when they're indoors and outdoors if they can't socially distance.
[05:35:00]
We're also seeing more younger people test positive. In New Jersey, 22 percent of the cases are for people aged between 18 and 29. That's up 10 percent since April.
Laura, back to you.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
JARRETT: Erica, thank you.
The European Union is considering a ban on travelers from the United States because of coronavirus. If the E.U. goes through with this the move would be a glaring rebuke of President Trump's handling of the pandemic.
CNN's Melissa Bell is live for us in Paris. Hi, Melissa.
MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Laura, good morning. Toss your mind back for a moment to early March. Europe was battling the beginning of its outbreak. Italy had just locked down. Donald Trump announced the closing of America's borders to European Union citizens.
Well, the shoe is on the other foot now. It is the E.U. considering whether once it starts lifting those restrictions on nationals from other countries coming into the E.U., whether it will not continue to ban certain countries.
At the moment and according to its objective criteria, Laura, that is whether or not a country is doing the same or better than the E.U. at combatting the outbreak -- at keeping those figures under control. For the time being, the United States does not qualify. And so the risk is that beyond the July first deadline, United States citizens will simply not be able to travel to the E.U., whereas the citizens of a lot of other countries will.
Now, when you consider the business ties between European countries and the United States -- all the business travel, Laura, that goes on -- the many millions of American citizens who come to Europe every year as tourists -- that will be a huge blow. And it will mean, essentially Laura, that for the time being and until a new decision is made you, in New York and me, in Paris will remain entirely physically cut off.
JARRETT: It will be really interesting to see how they weigh all these competing considerations. All right, Melissa, thank you so much.
Well, a very surprising turn after a noose was found in Bubba Wallace's garage at Talladega. The FBI now says this was not a hate crime. The rope had actually been there since October, long before Wallace was ever assigned to that spot last week. But, NASCAR now describes the item as a garage pull rope that was fashioned like a noose.
Many on social media reacted to the news viciously, calling it all a hoax.
Wallace spoke to CNN last night.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WALLACE: I'm pissed. I'm mad because people are trying to test my character and the person that I am and my integrity. And they're not stealing that away from me but they're just trying to test that.
But the image that I have and I have seen of what was hanging in my garage is not a -- is not a garage pull. I've been racing all my life. We've raced out of hundreds of garages that never had garage pulls like that.
It was a noose. Whether tied in 2019 or whatever, it was a noose. So, it wasn't directed at me but somebody tied a noose -- that's what I am saying. It was -- it is a noose.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Bubba Wallace is the only black driver at NASCAR's top level.
All right, coming up, New York City taking action on its latest problem, overnight fireworks.
[05:42:53]
JARRETT: Welcome back.
Developing overnight, big protests at Wisconsin's state capitol. A group of protesters tearing down two iconic statues, including one of an abolitionist who died trying to end slavery during the Civil War. That one was beheaded and thrown in a lake.
During the protests, KWOW reports Democratic State Sen. Tim Carpenter was attacked and collapsed before receiving medical attention.
That unrest began earlier Tuesday following the arrest of a black man after he brought a megaphone and a baseball bat into a Capitol Square restaurant.
All right. The list of companies joining the Stop Hate for Profit campaign is growing. The boycott led by the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, Color of Change, and other groups asked major companies to pause advertising on Facebook, citing its repeated failure to meaningfully address hate on its platforms.
Ben & Jerry's joined the campaign Tuesday, calling on Facebook to stop its platform from being used to spread and amplify racism and hate.
North Face was the first company to join the boycott last week, followed by REI and Patagonia.
Magnolia Pictures, the studio behind the movie ""Food, Inc."", became the first Hollywood studio to join the campaign, also on Tuesday. It said it would stop advertising on Facebook and Instagram through at least the end of July.
Eddie Bauer, another outdoor apparel brand, also said it's stopped -- it's going to pay -- stop paying ads on the platform through the end of July.
Many of the companies have not said whether the suspension could last longer. Since the boycott began last week, Facebook's stock has risen 1.4 percent.
All right. Right now, Russia is forging ahead with its annual Victory Day parade despite coronavirus cases now topping 600,000 there. The spectacle could give Vladimir Putin a much-needed boost.
CNN's Matthew Chance joins us live with the latest. Matthew, what are you expecting to see? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's already been taking place over the last couple of hours, Laura.
[05:45:00]
And it is, I have to say, pretty strange at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in Russia -- which has the third-highest number of infections in the world after Brazil and the United States -- to see such a big military parade be staged in the center of the Russian capital.
Thirteen thousand Russian troops, of course, backed by sort of various armored vehicles, being watched by thousands of people. There are invited VIP guests and thousands more in the streets of the center of the Russian capital.
Not really socially distancing, at least outside those stands, although the authorities say that inside Red Square, where the parade is being held, soldiers were socially distanced. The guests and onlookers were socially distanced.
And, of course, all the soldiers had been held in quarantine for two weeks beforehand as well to try and make sure that the coronavirus was not passed on in this potentially very close contact dangerous situation from a pandemic point of view.
But it's the political context, of course, that's all-important in Russia. It comes -- this parade does -- just a week before an important national vote, which could see Vladimir Putin have two extra terms given to him as president, which means he would be in power in Russia until 2036. And so, it's an important vote for the Kremlin.
JARRETT: All right, thank you so much. Good to see you, Matthew.
We'll be right back.

JARRETT: The Georgia Legislature has approved a hate crimes bill that allows enhanced criminal penalties for anyone who targets another because of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. Gov. Brian Kemp plans to sign the measure pending a legal review.
Until now, Georgia has been one of four states without a hate crime law. Lawmakers called for changes after the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery.
Well, that bill in Georgia passed on the same day Rayshard Brooks was remembered in a private funeral at the church where Martin Luther King Jr. was once pastor. Brooks was shot and killed by police in Atlanta two weeks ago.
MLK's daughter, Rev. Bernice King, spoke out against structural racism and she called for the demonstrations to continue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REV. BERNICE KING, CEO, MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. CENTER: If we miss this moment, we will find ourselves returning again and again to a pathway of chaos and self-destruction. So to all of my activists, to all of my organizers and people of goodwill, we cannot stop our cry for justice and our fight for freedom.

JARRETT: Both officers involved in Brooks' shooting have now been charged in the case; one with felony murder.
Complaints about illegal fireworks are soaring in New York City. It's getting so bad Mayor Bill de Blasio is forming a task force to combat the problem.
But some residents voiced concern when it was announced Tuesday that the city would be using police to address the issue at the same time the role of policing is being reassessed. But the mayor says the task force will focus on suppliers and distributors, not individuals who are setting the fireworks off.
In the first three weeks of June alone, there were more than 11,000 complaints. In the same timeframe last year, there were only 28 complaints. New York is one of several major cities reporting a large uptick in illegal firework complaints.
Well, a new three-digit number will make it easier to reach the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. Right now, the hotline is accessible by dialing a 10-digit number, 1-800-273-8255. But on July 16th, the FCC will formally vote to activate 988. All telecom carriers will be required to implement the new number by July of 2020.
All right, let's get a check on the markets. Looking at global markets, European markets are lower as the E.U. weighs blocking travelers, including Americans, due to the coronavirus. Asian markets closed mostly lower.
On Wall Street, futures are pointing to a lower open as well. Stocks closed higher Tuesday, though, after investors breathed a sigh of relief over the U.S.-China trade relations. The Dow closed up 131 points. The S&P and Nasdaq also finished higher with the Nasdaq hitting a new record high.
Well, there's a new best-performing work-from-home stock. Fastly took the top spot, surpassing Zoom, after it rallied 15 percent on Monday. The cloud computing company focuses on content, delivery services, with Slack, Spotify, and Shopify as some of its biggest customers.
Zoom surged at the start of the pandemic with millions of users signing on to stay connected with friends, work, and school. Fastly is now up 277 percent year-to-date. Zoom is just under 271 percent.
Well, New York City beaches will be open to the public for swimming on July first -- some good news for beach bums there. They were partially reopened for Memorial Day weekend with no swimming allowed. Officials are warning everyone to follow social distancing rules and cover their faces at the beach to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Well, you could call it the immaculate misconception. The Spanish owner of this famous painting of the Virgin Mary says he paid more than $1,300 to have it restored. But the furniture restorer he hired to clean that painting botched the job and in the process made a cartoonish mess of the Virgin Mary's face -- you can see there.
Conservation experts in Spain say it highlights the need to regulate the restoration business. Currently, a person can sell themselves as an art restoration expert even if they lack the necessary skills.
A lesson there to always check Yelp reviews for those.

All right, have a great day, everyone. I'm Laura Jarrett. ""NEW DAY"" is next.

FAUCI: The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surgings that we're seeing in Florida, in Texas, in Arizona.

OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates and a coalition of 162 co-signed elected officials and national, state, and local organizations sent a letter to the White House, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR), Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Representative David Kustoff (R-TN) urging them to rescind the President's Proclamation discriminating against Chinese students and abandon the Senate SECURE CAMPUS Act and companion legislation. The proclamation and bill are alarmist actions that not only constitute an immigration ban, but also hurt Asian Americans who are facing a spike in hate incidents due to COVID-19.
OCA Executive Director Rita Pin Ahrens made the following comment on the presidential proclamation:
""President Trump is pushing an unfounded conspiracy theory that all Chinese students are agents of China's government, and openly discriminating against Chinese students. The President is focusing on xenophobic immigration and asylum bans while Americans suffer from financial instability and the loss of loved ones. We call on the President to rescind his proclamation before it causes more damage to the nation's economy, research institutions, employers, and Asian American communities.""
We thank the signed organizations and elected officials for their solidarity and support in standing up to these xenophobic attacks on our communities. You can personally tell your elected officials to block the proclamation by texting 'Sign IZXOCW' to 50409.
OCA encourages victims and/or witnesses of hate incidents to contact Matt Nguyen-Ngo for more resources and to share their stories at aapihatecrimes.org.

June 4, 2020
To: President Donald Trump, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500
Senator Tom Cotton, 326 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510
Senator Marsha Blackburn, 357 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510
Representative David Kustoff, 523 Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515
Dear President Donald Trump, Senators Tom Cotton and Marsha Blackburn, and Representative David Kustoff:
On behalf of OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, and the 162 undersigned organizations, we urge the President to rescind his divisive and discriminatory Presidential Proclamation on the Suspension of Entry as Nonimmigrants of Certain Students and Researchers from the People's Republic of China, following the release of the SECURE CAMPUS Act. In the wake of rising hate incidents against Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans, language that fans the flames of xenophobia further endangers our communities. Although there are concerns about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), this Proclamation assumes without evidence that all Chinese students coming to learn in the U.S. are spies, which is patently false. Many of these students go on to become Americans and are integral parts of our society. Further, this Proclamation provides cover for increased racial profiling, terminations, and investigations of Chinese Americans in academic settings. During this epidemic of hate, more than ever, it is destructive to vilify and scapegoat the people of an entire nation, as well as Chinese Americans who have origins there.
Asian American communities around the country have experienced an alarming surge in anti-Chinese sentiment since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak./1 Asian Americans report being subjected to hateful tirades, being refused service in public areas, assault, and worse. OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates and other leading organizations have received over 1,900 individual reports of hate incidents and crimes against Asian Americans since January./2 These incidents are driven by divisive language from the President and congressional leadership.
For example, on March 14th, a 47-year-old father and his 10-year-old son were followed and attacked in Queens, NY at a bus stop./3 The assailant shouted profanities and struck the father on the head in front of his son. On the same day, an Asian American family fell victim to a knife attack while shopping at a Sam's Club in Midland, TX./4 In the San Fernando Valley, CA, a 16-year old Asian American boy was physically assaulted at school after being accused of having COVID-19./5 And at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, two Chinese international students were attacked with raw eggs thrown from a moving vehicle./6 We know these incidents to be merely the tip of the iceberg, as hate crimes have long been severely under-reported and inadequately defined. As these racially-motivated attacks accelerate in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, it becomes increasingly imperative that our elected officials ensure the safety and well-being of all Asian Americans.
We have also witnessed a worrying trend of ethnic and racial profiling of Chinese national and Chinese American academics being accused of economic espionage. The percentage of defendants charged under the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) who were of Chinese descent has tripled from 17% from 1997 to 2009 to 52% after 2009./7 Yet one in five persons of Chinese descent accused of economic espionage are never proven guilty of espionage or other serious crimes, a rate twice that of defendants with European surnames, suggesting that those of Chinese descent are disproportionately arrested with less evidence of wrongdoing. Over the last decade, many prominent Chinese American STEM researchers have suffered career-ending workplace discrimination, in the form of terminations and investigations motivated by sinophobic suspicion and profiling./8 The SECURE CAMPUS Act will only legitimize further discrimination against students and scientists.
A unilateral ban on Chinese graduate and post-graduate students is a step backwards towards past discrimination, and reminds us eerily of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This law drove widespread paranoia around Chinese immigrants bringing disease and harming the economy. Both chambers of Congress expressed their regret for the law in a 2011 resolution. Now, that same xenophobia drives us to scapegoat these Chinese students. To ban a specific ethnic group based on the assumption that all persons of Chinese descent are spies is a crude approach that will do little, if anything, to protect intellectual property. We are deeply disturbed that our President and Members of Congress are focused on sowing division and inciting violence while millions of Americans struggle with unemployment and health crises, Asian Americans face increasingly severe hate incidents, and police officers brutalize peaceful protesters around the country.
It is imperative that we come together in these uncertain times. We need leadership that is grounded in truth and compassion, and is committed to taking on racism and xenophobia. We therefore urge the President to withdraw his proclamation, and for the Members of Congress to abandon the SECURE CAMPUS Act in order to demonstrate their commitment to protecting Asian Americans from hate, racial profiling in the workplace and academia, and to avoid repeating the most shameful parts of American history. Abandoning this bill is necessary to affirm that ALL individuals belong in our neighborhoods and universities.
Sincerely,
Rita Pin Ahrens

Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks, as delivered, on the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide, observed today:
Please join me in a moment of silence in memory of the victims of genocide and other atrocity crimes.
[MOMENT OF SILENCE]
Genocide is the most heinous of crimes, encompassing all it touches in a tsunami of hate and destruction. It is an assault on our most fundamental shared values. And today, as we remember and honour the victims of the crime of genocide, we must not forget that the imperative to prevent genocide lies at the core of our organization’s purpose.
This is evidenced by the adoption of the Genocide Convention in December 1948 in the aftermath of the Holocaust and the Second World War. It was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly. And it remains as relevant as ever as we work to prevent genocide and other atrocity crimes — crimes which are sadly still being perpetrated with impunity and no regard for the sanctity of human life.
This year the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our societies’ deep fragilities and exacerbated already formidable peace and security challenges. That is why I continue to appeal for a global ceasefire, and I have called on the Security Council to work towards that goal by the end of this year.
Genocide never fails to shock the world when it occurs. But, it is never committed without clear, multiple warning signs. The victims are often early targets of hate speech, discrimination and violence. One of our remaining challenges, 72 years after the Genocide Convention’s adoption, is to promptly recognize and act on these warning signs.
We need to remain constantly vigilant of key political, human rights, humanitarian, social and economic developments worldwide to identify early the risks of genocide and other atrocity crimes. Hate speech is one of these warning signs, and we need to do better in rejecting it in all its forms. This includes ensuring that technology companies and social media platforms play their part. The power of social media in disseminating hate speech and polarizing communities cannot be underestimated.
I urge a renewed focus on national, regional and international prevention strategies that address, in particular, the incitement of violence against groups or individuals. Religious leaders and civil society also have a key role to play in preventing and mitigating its risk. Governments need to guarantee civic space for human rights institutions and defenders to do their essential work and they need to protect the rights of those at risk.
To prevent genocide, it is also essential that we pursue credible and effective accountability. The link between systemic impunity and atrocity crimes is clear. The answer lies in impartial investigations backed up by prosecutions.
It also means access to justice and effective remedies for victims. Because, although accountability processes acknowledge the suffering and courage of victims, they rarely address their psychological and material needs. Victims have rights to truth, justice, reparation and a comprehensive package of guarantees of non-recurrence.
Today, I want to acknowledge the contribution of national mechanisms, as well as relevant international tribunals and investigative bodies, in ensuring accountability for atrocity crimes. The Human Rights Council, General Assembly and Security Council investigative bodies — fact-finding missions, groups of experts, high-level missions and commissions of inquiry — also play a fundamental role.
We will listen today to the experiences of victims and reflect on what we can do better to prevent further crimes and to protect victims’ human rights, including their right to reparation.
I also want to pay tribute to the pivotal role of civil society organizations in raising the voices of victims and calling for accountability and reparations. It often takes decades and generations for a community destroyed by genocide to recover.
Preventing genocide ultimately involves all of society, which must always remain committed and vigilant. It is crucial that we all join hands to defend the principles of equality and human dignity.
We must work harder to repair the fissures and polarization that are so prevalent in our societies today. On this international day to commemorate the victims of genocide and affirm their dignity, let us invest in prevention and commit to upholding the responsibilities established in the Genocide Convention."

Zadie Smith’s presence will always carry a significant memory of the 24-year-old who published “White Teeth” to international acclaim. But, being subject to the space-time continuum, Smith is in her mid-40s now, and has the temperament and perspective of someone who could be (a compliment, in this case) 105.
It’s never a boom time for wisdom — almost by definition; if it were more common, it wouldn’t be valued so highly — but this is an especially arid era for it. We’re in the Age of Certainty, at least in the bellowing of its various constituents. And maybe that’s fine; maybe some times are just for fighting ideological fire with ideological fire. But “polemic” is too generous a word for the dominant cultural tone.
All of which makes Smith feel especially out of time. In the very brief foreword to her first book of essays, “Changing My Mind,” she wrote: “Ideological inconsistency is, for me, practically an article of faith.” That faith doesn’t seem to have wavered in the 10 years since that book was published. “Intimations,” her slender new collection (less than 100 pages) of ultra-timely essays (several written in the past few momentous months), showcases her trademark levelheadedness.
This cast of mind doesn’t mean that Smith avoids moral stances. In “Intimations,” she speaks clearly and forcefully about the murder of George Floyd and the legacy of slavery and the systemic sins revealed by Covid-19. “The virus map of the New York boroughs turns redder along precisely the same lines as it would if the relative shade of crimson counted not infection and death but income brackets and middle-school ratings,” she writes. “Death comes to all — but in America it has long been considered reasonable to offer the best chance of delay to the highest bidder.”
At her most withering, on the subject of race, she writes about the many, “even in the bluest states in America,” who “are very happy to ‘blackout’ their social media for a day, to read all-Black books and ‘educate’ themselves about Black issues — as long as this education does not occur in the form of actual Black children attending their actual schools.”
But despite these jabs, Smith remains unmistakably noncombative. This spirit appears born not of a fear of confrontation but a genuine perplexity (of a searching, brilliant kind) at the nature of experience and people, including herself. She says that the art of writing, though it’s often advertised as “creative,” is really about “control.” “The part of the university in which I teach,” she says, “should properly be called the Controlling Experience Department.”
As a writer and reader, what she finds — in a phrase perfectly suited to her sensibility — is “a wide repertoire of possible attitudes.” But out in the world, living eludes control; it’s “mystifying, overwhelming, conscious, subconscious,” and “it just keeps coming at you.”
Smith’s gifts as a novelist animate her essays. Writing about the neighborhood nail place where she regularly goes for stress relief, we get a portrait of her masseur, Ben, who teases her for always reading during their sessions and who asks where her hair “comes from.” (“Jamaica and England — via Africa,” she tells him. Ben replies: “Ho ho ho! Interesting mix!”) As the essay closes, Smith watches Ben from afar, the optimistic face she’s used to seeing changed into “a stern portrait of calculation and concern,” worried, Smith assumes, about the constant heavy traffic needed for the place to pay the rent.
Anxiety lurks through these few pages. This is a work of minor dimensions at — and about — a major time. (Royalties from the book will go to two charities, The Equal Justice Initiative and The COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund for New York.)
Smith herself left New York early on in the pandemic’s course, and she expresses guilt about this without over-performing it. She bemoans, when thinking about the apocalypse or anything even approaching it, her lack of a survival instinct. “A book like ‘The Road’ is as incomprehensible to me as a Norse myth cycle in the original language,” she writes. “Suicide would hold out its quiet hand to me on the first day — the first hour.”
In an essay called “Suffering Like Mel Gibson” (its title is a play on a popular meme), she writes provocatively of Christ on the cross, looking at those crucified beside him and wondering “whether his agonies, when all was said and done, were relatively speaking in fact better than those of the thieves and beggars to his left and right whose sufferings long predated their present crucifixions and who had no hope (unlike Christ) of an improved post-cross situation.” This thought comes in a passage addressing the word of this century so far, “privilege,” which she does with her usual many-sidedness: She notes her own advantages; parses the stubbornness of inequality; and outlines the explanatory (and experiential) limitations of privilege, including its ultimate inability to shield anyone from suffering, sometimes to the point of suicide. In Zadie Smith’s universe — meaning, for my money, the one we’re all living in — complexity is king.
She sympathizes with the generations coming up behind her, born into a beleaguered century and now living through the current crises with worried eyes on a deeply tenuous future. In one of the finest lines in “Intimations,” Smith writes: “The infinite promise of American youth — a promise elaborately articulated by movies and advertisements and university prospectuses — has been an empty lie for so long that I notice my students joking about it with a black humor more appropriate to old men, to the veterans of wars.”
It might be engrossing to hear Smith in conversation with those she now teaches, to see where their ideas overlap and diverge. Toward the end of the book, she writes elliptically of identity as an “area of interest.” Elsewhere she argues for solidarity among “the plague class — that is, all economically exploited people, whatever their race.”
Interested in what she once called “coalition across difference,” Smith has some opinions that she defines as commonplace but that she must know are now hotly debated.
She resists, for instance, the idea of “hate crime” as a desirable distinction, calling it “an elevation of importance in what strikes me as the wrong direction,” lending an undeserved power to the bigotry that inspires the term.
“The hatred of a group qua group is, after all, the most debased and irrational of hatreds, the weakest, the most banal,” she writes. “It shouldn’t radiate a special aura, lifting it into a separate epistemological category. For this is exactly what the killer believes.”

But ''polemic'' is too generous a word for the dominant cultural tone. 
 All of which makes Smith feel especially out of time. In the very brief foreword to her first book of essays, ''Changing My Mind,'' she wrote: ''Ideological inconsistency is, for me, practically an article of faith.'' That faith doesn't seem to have wavered in the 10 years since that book was published. ''Intimations,'' her slender new collection (less than 100 pages) of ultra-timely essays (several written in the past few momentous months), showcases her trademark levelheadedness.
 This cast of mind doesn't mean that Smith avoids moral stances. In ''Intimations,'' she speaks clearly and forcefully about the murder of George Floyd and the legacy of slavery and the systemic sins revealed by Covid-19. ''The virus map of the New York boroughs turns redder along precisely the same lines as it would if the relative shade of crimson counted not infection and death but income brackets and middle-school ratings,'' she writes. ''Death comes to all -- but in America it has long been considered reasonable to offer the best chance of delay to the highest bidder.''
 At her most withering, on the subject of race, she writes about the many, ''even in the bluest states in America,'' who ''are very happy to 'blackout' their social media for a day, to read all-Black books and 'educate' themselves about Black issues -- as long as this education does not occur in the form of actual Black children attending their actual schools.''
 But despite these jabs, Smith remains unmistakably noncombative. This spirit appears born not of a fear of confrontation but a genuine perplexity (of a searching, brilliant kind) at the nature of experience and people, including herself. She says that the art of writing, though it's often advertised as ''creative,'' is really about ''control.'' ''The part of the university in which I teach,'' she says, ''should properly be called the Controlling Experience Department.''
 As a writer and reader, what she finds -- in a phrase perfectly suited to her sensibility -- is ''a wide repertoire of possible attitudes.'' But out in the world, living eludes control; it's ''mystifying, overwhelming, conscious, subconscious,'' and ''it just keeps coming at you.''
 Smith's gifts as a novelist animate her essays. Writing about the neighborhood nail place where she regularly goes for stress relief, we get a portrait of her masseur, Ben, who teases her for always reading during their sessions and who asks where her hair ''comes from.'' (''Jamaica and England -- via Africa,'' she tells him. Ben replies: ''Ho ho ho! Interesting mix!'') As the essay closes, Smith watches Ben from afar, the optimistic face she's used to seeing changed into ''a stern portrait of calculation and concern,'' worried, Smith assumes, about the constant heavy traffic needed for the place to pay the rent.
 Anxiety lurks through these few pages. This is a work of minor dimensions at -- and about -- a major time. (Royalties from the book will go to two charities, The Equal Justice Initiative and The COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund for New York.)
 Smith herself left New York early on in the pandemic's course, and she expresses guilt about this without over-performing it. She bemoans, when thinking about the apocalypse or anything even approaching it, her lack of a survival instinct. ''A book like 'The Road' is as incomprehensible to me as a Norse myth cycle in the original language,'' she writes. ''Suicide would hold out its quiet hand to me on the first day -- the first hour.''
 In an essay called ''Suffering Like Mel Gibson'' (its title is a play on a popular meme), she writes provocatively of Christ on the cross, looking at those crucified beside him and wondering ''whether his agonies, when all was said and done, were relatively speaking in fact better than those of the thieves and beggars to his left and right whose sufferings long predated their present crucifixions and who had no hope (unlike Christ) of an improved post-cross situation.'' This thought comes in a passage addressing the word of this century so far, ''privilege,'' which she does with her usual many-sidedness: She notes her own advantages; parses the stubbornness of inequality; and outlines the explanatory (and experiential) limitations of privilege, including its ultimate inability to shield anyone from suffering, sometimes to the point of suicide. In Zadie Smith's universe -- meaning, for my money, the one we're all living in -- complexity is king.
 She sympathizes with the generations coming up behind her, born into a beleaguered century and now living through the current crises with worried eyes on a deeply tenuous future. In one of the finest lines in ''Intimations,'' Smith writes: ''The infinite promise of American youth -- a promise elaborately articulated by movies and advertisements and university prospectuses -- has been an empty lie for so long that I notice my students joking about it with a black humor more appropriate to old men, to the veterans of wars.''
 It might be engrossing to hear Smith in conversation with those she now teaches, to see where their ideas overlap and diverge. Toward the end of the book, she writes elliptically of identity as an ''area of interest.'' Elsewhere she argues for solidarity among ''the plague class -- that is, all economically exploited people, whatever their race.''
 Interested in what she once called ''coalition across difference,'' Smith has some opinions that she defines as commonplace but that she must know are now hotly debated.
 She resists, for instance, the idea of ''hate crime'' as a desirable distinction, calling it ''an elevation of importance in what strikes me as the wrong direction,'' lending an undeserved power to the bigotry that inspires the term.
 ''The hatred of a group qua group is, after all, the most debased and irrational of hatreds, the weakest, the most banal,'' she writes. ''It shouldn't radiate a special aura, lifting it into a separate epistemological category. For this is exactly what the killer believes.''Follow John Williams on Twitter: @johnwilliamsnyt.Intimations: Six EssaysBy Zadie Smith97 pages. Penguin Books. $10.95.

55,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The Bismarck Tribune",2020-09-19,"891 words","A; Pg. 9","MICHAEL BALSAMO, ALANNA DURKIN RICHER AND COLLEEN LONG Associated Press",NA,"300 and counting: Push by feds to arrest in protests",FALSE,"WASHINGTON - In a private call with federal prosecutors across the country, Attorney General William Barr's message was clear: Aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence.
Barr pushed his U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges whenever they could, keeping a grip on cases even if a defendant could be tried instead in state court, according to officials with knowledge of a recent call who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences.
The Trump administration's crackdown has already led to more than 300 arrests on federal crimes in the protests that erupted following the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many are accused of violent crimes like arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not - prompting criticism that at least some arrests are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations.
""The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable,"" said Charles Sunwabe, who's representing an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest. ""It's an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them,"" he said.
Some cases are viewed as trumped up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, like a teen accused of civil disorder for claiming online ""we are not each other's enemy, only enemy is 12,"" a reference to law enforcement.
The Trump administration has seized on the demonstrations and an aggressive federal response to showcase what the president says is his law-and-order prowess, claiming he's countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump has derided protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority are peaceful.
Pockets of violence have indeed popped up in cities across the U.S., including Portland, Oregon, where protests devolved into clashes with law enforcement for weeks on end. Nights of looting and other unrest have occurred in other cities, including Rochester, New York; Louisville, Kentucky; Minneapolis, Washington and Chicago.
Federal officials were also called into to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teen has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man accused of shooting and killing a demonstrator in Louisville following the death of Breonna Taylor.
While Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at law enforcement, he has argued there's seldom reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, however, has opened a number of civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.
Federal involvement in local cases is nothing new. Officials across the country have turned to the Justice Department for decades, particularly for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal penalties and there is no parole.
Police chiefs in several cities have pointed to the importance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.
Even before the unrest earlier this year, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring charges in states where the government believes justice isn't being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman accused of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.
It's not clear whether protest-related arrests will continue apace. Demonstrations have slowed, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have dampened some of the conflict.
While many local prosecutors have dismissed dozens of low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.
Even some Democrats, including District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the Trump administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork didn't identify specific crimes tied to each suspect.
The federal confrontation with Bowser seemed counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the Democratic mayor.
About a third of the federal protest-related cases are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal courthouse and throwing rocks at officers."

U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Lankford (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations. The funding allocated by this program will support nonprofit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.3 percent of crimes motivated by anti-religious sentiment were against the Jewish community.
""FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,"" said Senator Portman.
""The rise in anti-semitic and hate-fueled crimes across New York is unconscionable. No community should have to live in fear due to who they are or how they worship,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""The Nonprofit Security Grant Program, is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security. I will always fight to expand NGSP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence.""
""Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,"" said Senator Peters. ""I have long championed this program, and I'm proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities.""
""This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,"" said Senator Lankford. ""As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don't necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance.""
""Anti-Semitic violence in the U.S. has grown at an alarming rate,"" said Senator Rosen. ""Whether it's in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans.""
""Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,"" said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. ""We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations.""
In January, Senator Portman and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) announced that President Trump signed their bipartisan Protecting Faith-Based and Nonprofit Organizations From Terrorism Act into law. This legislation authorizes $75 million annually for five years, from FYs 2020-2024, for NSGP. Under the legislation, funding may be used for target-hardening activities, training for personnel, and any other appropriate activity, as defined by the FEMA Administrator. While the bill authorizes $75 million annually for the program for the next five years, Congress can appropriate more. Portman joined his bipartisan colleagues in December 2019 in requesting that the appropriators fund the program at $90 million. That request was approved and included in the final FY 2020 appropriations agreement.
Read the text of the letter here or below:
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate's $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today's quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process.[1] During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment.[2] To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke ""a racial holy war.""[3]
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,[4] which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14% increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States.
These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually.[5] The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today's threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants.[6] With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,"

(MICHAEL REYNOLDS / AP)
Under fire from US President Donald Trump and his allies, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google rebuffed accusations of anti-conservative bias at a Senate hearing on Wednesday and promised to aggressively defend their platforms from being used to sow chaos in next week's presidential election.
Lawmakers of both parties, eyeing the companies' tremendous power to disseminate speech and ideas, are looking to challenge their long-enjoyed bedrock legal protections for online speech－the stated topic for the hearing but one quickly overtaken by questions related to the presidential campaign.
With worries over election security growing, senators on the Commerce Committee extracted promises from Twitter's Jack Dorsey, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai that their companies will be on guard against meddling by foreign actors or the incitement of violence around the election results.
Testifying via video, the executives said they are taking several steps, including partnerships with news organizations, to distribute accurate information about voting. Dorsey said Twitter was working closely with state election officials.
Republicans, led by Trump, have accused the social media platforms, without evidence, of deliberately suppressing conservative views. They say that behavior has reached new heights in the contest between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
The laws governing online speech must be updated because the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack.
Roger Wicker, a Republican Senator of the United States
Republican Senator Roger Wicker, the committee's chairman, said the laws governing online speech must be updated because ""the openness and freedom of the internet are under attack"".
Wicker cited the move this month by Facebook and Twitter to limit dissemination of an unverified story from the conservative-leaning New York Post about Biden.
The story, which was not used by other publications, cited unverified emails from Biden's son Hunter that were reportedly disclosed by Trump's supporters.
""Twitter's conduct has by far been the most egregious,"" Senator Ted Cruz told Dorsey. Cruz cited Twitter's limitations on the newspaper story as part of ""a pattern of censorship and silencing Americans with whom Twitter disagrees"".
""Who the hell elected you? And put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report?"" Cruz asked.

Dorsey told Cruz that he does not believe that Twitter can influence elections because it's only one source of information. He tried to steer senators away from conventional notions of political bias, noting that ""much of the content people see today is determined by algorithms"".
On Tuesday, Facebook stopped accepting any new political advertising. Previously booked political ads will be able to run until the polls close on Nov 3, when all political advertising will temporarily be banned.
Google, which owns YouTube, also is halting political ads after the polls close. Twitter banned all political ads last year.
Democrats focused their criticism mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence, keep people from voting or spread falsehoods about the coronavirus.
They criticized the tech CEOs for failing to police content, blaming the platforms for playing a role in hate crimes and the rise of white supremacy in the United States.
The CEOs argued the liability shield has helped make the internet what it is today, though Zuckerberg said he believes Congress ""should update the law to make sure it's working as intended"". Dorsey and Pichai urged caution in making any changes.

""But knowing is not enough. We have to be agents of revolutionary love.""
Kaur's new memoir, See No Stranger, is an account of her effort to learn, teach, and live that ethic. Her family's story in America, she writes, starts with her paternal grandfather, Kehar Singh, or Bab Ji, who came to the United States in 1913 and was immediately imprisoned in line with the country's racist immigration policies. A white immigration attorney, Henry Marshall, filed a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf and he was released. He became a farmer in California's central valley, where her family has lived since. If Marshall had seen her grandfather as a stranger, Kaur writes, she would not have even been born.

Growing up ""one hundred years after Baba Ji made America home,"" Kaur writes, ""I thought that all of our hardest battles were behind us."" But 9/11 disabused her of that notion. Following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C., hate crimes and assaults on Sikh people skyrocketed. 
Balbir Singh Sodhi, a gas station owner who was a friend of Kaur's family, was the first person murdered in a hate crime after the attacks. Kaur began criss-crossing the country to interview and film Sikh survivors of hate for the documentary film Divided We Fall: Americans in the Aftermath. ""We built our organizations, we developed our media strategies, and we launched campaigns all around this idea that people needed to know the basic tenets of the Sikh faith and needed to know that we've been victims,"" she told me.
The hope that education might be enough ended for Kaur in 2012, when a shooter killed six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek Wisconsin. Most people have not even heard of the Oak Creek shooting; ""It disappeared from the nation's conscience almost as soon as it occurred,"" Kaur writes. But Kaur tells the story of the victims and their families, who she knows personally, and of their grief and faith. She also recounts how the Sikhs included the shooter, who killed himself, in their service for the dead.
Revolutionary love is about loving others. But it's also, Kaur says, about loving one's enemies. Kaur writes that her maternal grandfather, Papa Ji, explained the Sikh tradition of warrior love. ""Love is dangerous business...If you see no stranger, then you must love people, even when they do not love you. You must wonder about them even when they refuse to wonder about you."" The battle is hardest because it is not just waged against one's enemies, but for them. Kaur talks in the book about how she has worked to understand and love a police officer who badly and deliberately injured her arm in a protest, and a cousin who threatened her with a gun.
""I've learned that there's no such thing as monsters in this world,"" she reflects during our conversation. ""They're only people who are wounded who are acting out of their own insecurity or their blindness or their ignorance. And once we get curious about them, even then, we begin to gather the information we need in order to change the conditions that radicalized them. Loving our opponents is not just a moral call. It's pragmatic, it is strategic. It is how we learn to fight in ways that don't just resist bad actors or remove bad actors from power, but actually change the systems, institutions, and cultures in which they operate.""
Kaur's call to return love when met with hatred will provoke resistance, she knows. But she says that in her own life, loving the policeman who hurt her has been easier than loving herself. Perhaps the most painful parts of the book are the discussion of her emotionally abusive relationship with her ex-fianceé, and her maternal grandfather's rejection of her relationship with her non-Sikh husband. Though he taught her to see no one as a stranger, he had trouble loving and accepting the choices of his own granddaughter. And she had to give herself permission to believe that he was wrong.
""I think our bodies carry information for what we are ready for, now. So, when I think of certain opponents, if I feel that my body is activated and flushed with rage or flushed with grief, then I know that my job right now is to attend to my own wounds,"" she told me. When someone is harming you, she said, it's not your obligation ""to try to wonder about them and try to love them. Your job is your own survival and your own flourishing.""
Part of loving oneself is allowing oneself to feel anger when others harm you, Kaur says. The opposite of love is not anger, but indifference, and though she's soft-spoken, there is a good deal of rage in her book. ""Especially as a woman of color, I was always taught to be ashamed of my rage, to suppress it down inside of me,"" she told me ""And it took me a long journey, as you read, to understand that my rage carried information, that it showed me that my body and my life were worth protecting, that I had something worth fighting for."" 
Anger and love are both hard to sustain over two decades, and Kaur admits that the last four years, the pandemic, and ongoing violence have been very difficult for someone who has been advocating for marginalized people since the Bush administration. ""I ask every day now, is this darkness in our country the darkness of the tomb or the darkness of the womb? There's so much cruelty and incompetence in our leadership, it feels like death has won.""
But she adds that she's seen ""glimpses of the nation that longs to be born."" Black Lives Matter marches or the activists that clogged airports to protest Trump's Muslim ban have given her hope. Along with warrior metaphors of rage and battle, she says she returns to metaphors of labor and birth, and a belief that something new and better can come out of the current pain and despair. ""How do we show up to the fire and still breathe and push and breathe and push?"" she asks, and answers without pausing. ""It's true love."

""June is Pride Month where we celebrate inclusion and equality. During this time, we reaffirm our commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, celebrate the progress that has been achieved, and reflect on the work that must still be done. Pride Month has a history born of activism. What began as a fight for life and liberty resulted in a month-long celebration of authenticity.
Pride Month allows people to bravely embrace their identities that have for too long been marginalized, attacked, and disgraced. Because this marginalization continues, last month, I introduced the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act (H.R.6721) which seeks to combat coronavirus-related threats and attacks, including those against the LGBTQ+ community. I also strongly supported and voted for provisions in the recent House-passed Heroes Act that would strengthen LGBTQ+ non-discrimination protections, including measures directed toward LGBTQ+ youth.
While the Trump administration has continued its assault on LGBTQ+ individuals in the areas of health care and civil rights, the Supreme Court recently upheld protections for LGBTQ+ workers by ruling that employees cannot be fired for their gender identity or sexual orientation. Everyone has the right to live and love freely - without fear of discrimination or harassment.
As a Vice Chair of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I will always be a proud ally to the LGBTQ+ community, and I'm honored to wish a happy Pride Month to all who celebrate.""

68,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","CNN.com",2020-10-20,"616 words","US","By Alisha Ebrahimji and Amanda Jackson, CNN",NA,"San Francisco's 'CAREN Act,' making racially biased 911 calls illegal, is one step closer to becoming a law",FALSE,"It may soon be illegal to make discriminatory, racially biased 911 calls in San Francisco.
The ""CAREN Act"" (Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies) was introduced in July at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting by Supervisor Shamann Walton.
The ordinance is one step closer to becoming a law. On Tuesday, the board unanimously passed the act on first read. Next week, the bill has to be voted on again by the board, and then it will be sent to Mayor London Breed to sign.
The ordinance's name is a twist on ""Karen,"" the name social media gives people making racially biased 911 calls.
And it's not just ""Karen."" There are also names like ""Becky,"" which has also come to symbolize a stereotype of whiteness. And ""Susan."" And ""Chad.""
The ""CAREN Act"" has been met with support and opposition since it was proposed. Several residents wrote letters to the board urging them to reconsider renaming the ordinance, citing it is sexist and targets people with the name of ""Karen.""
""The name of the act places a target on my name as a racist and I am not,"" one resident wrote in a letter to the board. ""By associating the name 'Caren' or anyone elses name with such a law, really is offensive.""
""I do not have objection to this act; the issue it is trying to address is wrong,"" wrote another resident. "" I do strongly object to the the name. The insensitive choice of many people to use the name Karen as a general purpose term of disapproval for middle age white women needs to stop.""
The ordinance is similar to the statewide AB 1550 bill introduced by California Assemblyman Rob Bonta, making it unlawful and accountable for a caller to ""fabricate false racially biased emergency reports."".
""Using 911 as a tool for your prejudice towards marginalized communities is unjust and wrong!"" Bonta tweeted.
Racially motivated 911 calls aren't a new occurrence across the country, in spite of a recent uptick following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Earlier this summer, a White hotel employee in North Carolina called the police on a guest, a Black woman and her children, who were using the hotel's swimming pool. And in May, a White woman called 911 on a Black man who was birdwatching in New York's Central Park.
Bonta said the intent of AB 1550 isn't to discourage Californians in real danger from calling 911.
""This bill could protect millions of Californians from becoming targets of hate and prevent the weaponization of our law enforcement against communities of color,"" he said in an online release.
""Racist false reports put people in danger and waste resources,"" the ordinance's co-author, Supervisor Matt Haney, tweeted.
Though making a false police report is a misdemeanor or felony offense in many states, including California, accountability is lacking for making racially biased calls to law enforcement.
Other cities have already begun the process to pass similar legislation.
Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price introduced a similar motion to the City Council in June exploring ""criminal penalties, rights of victims to bring private civil actions and cost recovery by the City,"" he tweeted.
In 2019, the City Commission in Grand Rapids, Michigan, held a public hearing on a ""proposed human rights ordinance"" criminalizing racially motivated calls to 911 with a fine of up to $500.
In 2018, former New York state Sen. Jesse Hamilton proposed a bill after a woman called 911 on him for campaigning, that would require the local district attorney to investigate these incidents as hate crimes. If the calls were deemed racially motivated, a number of consequences such as fines, sensitivity training or jail time would be issued."
69,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Jerusalem Post",2020-11-01,"882 words","OPINION; Pg. 10","JENNIFER SHULKIN",NA,"Curriculums on inclusion must not exclude antisemitism",FALSE,"In the wake of George Floyd's murder and the nation's calls for racial justice, many American schools have rightly committed to implementing new ethnic-studies and race-relations lesson plans into their curriculums. These curriculum changes encourage students to contemplate how prejudice toward and discrimination of marginalized groups of people remain infused into many aspects of our present-day world. They prioritize honest discussions about race.
Yet even as inclusion becomes a higher priority than ever before, there is great risk that teaching about the dangers of antisemitism will fall by the wayside. Excluding antisemitism from this wave of anti-prejudice teaching would be a grave mistake.
The subjugation of African-Americans is a unique stain on American society, and it deserves thorough treatment in American schools. I am not inviting relativistic comparisons between the African-American story (or any other minority group's story) and the Jewish story; I am only suggesting that each of these stories deserves to be told. The Jewish people have faced rampant and often deadly antisemitism in every generation and all over the world. American schoolchildren should know.
Antisemitism is easily recognizable when a shooter targets a synagogue in Pittsburgh, an attacker stabs a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Monsey, or a vandal draws swastikas on playgrounds. But these heinous tragedies are often written off as rare occurrences, when in fact antisemitism is far more pervasive.
I am not an educator and know little about designing school curriculums. But I am a third-generation Holocaust survivor. I am also a former prosecutor. And in that role, I learned both about how the justice system disproportionately affects black and brown people, and how hate crimes embody a special type of evil. Antisemitic hate crimes reported to the FBI rose by 40% from 2014 to 2018. And of the 364 hate crimes reported in New York in 2019, 148 targeted Jewish people. These are staggering numbers.
Crime is not the only way that antisemitism surfaces today. College students have increasingly experienced antisemitism on campus - mainly in the form of open and outspoken anti-Zionism, which more often than not is a thinly veiled disguise for antisemitism. Separately, some people have blamed the Jews (without any logic or proof) for the global coronavirus outbreak. As a result, antisemitism cannot be dismissed as merely a relic of our history books.
Yet to understand the antisemitism of today, educators must present antisemitism's history. Without exploring past persecution, we cannot expect schoolchildren to recognize the warning signs of rising antisemitism today or in the future.
NEW RACE-CONSCIOUS lesson plans will generally include topics like the theft of Native American land and culture, the Jim Crow era, and the Japanese internment camps. In that spirit, these lesson plans should also include the slaughter of the Jews in Russian pogroms, the systematic murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust, and the widespread housing and university admissions discrimination against American Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries, as a start.
School lesson plans should not separate distinct racial groups and draw distinct lessons from each episode of discrimination explored. Instead, the plight of various racial groups should be taught in a way that recognizes the overlapping features and patterns of discrimination so that schoolchildren can identify them when they come across them in their own lives. The fact that Jewish persecution is the world's oldest and most geographically widespread form of hatred is instructive: Antisemitism is a mutable virus, and its many mutations and various chapters each carry valuable lessons about prejudice, hate and race relations.
Many school districts and private institutions throughout the country have quickly responded to this spring and summer's uproar over racial injustice by already incorporating race relations lessons into their curriculums this fall. Others have not yet done so, but are considering doing so in the future.
There is danger in antisemitism being excluded (or demonized) in these new curriculum changes, as was the case in California's first ethnic studies plan. The California plan valorized the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (an organized boycott of Israeli goods and services) and painted Israelis as colonizers. It also presented the ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" (a group known for preaching antisemitism) as an important religious movement to cover. Moreover, while an entire lesson plan was devoted to Islamophobia in the United States, there was not even a definition of antisemitism to be found in the glossary. The curriculum seemed to include every minority group except the Jews.
Many people today believe that antisemitism is separate from and less insidious than classic racism, but it is one of the world's oldest and deepest forms of hatred. American schools must understand it as such to ensure that the next generation can recognize, define and reject antisemitism going forward.
As we rework school curriculums to be more inclusive, please do not exclude antisemitism.

In the weekend's spectacle of those far-right thugs piling into London and chanting 'In-ger-land', there lies an imperative: to fight the populists and racists on their most treasured ground, and contest their archaic, hateful view of the country they think they speak for. 
This is not about the inanities of patriotism, but an understanding of the place we all call home, and how we interpret what is happening right now. As I watched that very different crowd throw Edward Colston into Bristol harbour, I thought of the final single put out by those great anti-racists The Clash, and two lines sung in anger and sadness that capture a challenge still unmet: 'This is England. This is how we feel.''2. Tim Stanley in The Daily Telegraphon a Britain most Brits'simply cannot recognise'Extremists speak for nobody in this unwanted culture war[6]'In summary, a statue of the man who defeated fascism was defaced by anti-racism campaigners and then 'defended' by fat drunken fascists. I can imagine most of us would prefer to sit this culture war out - but on Saturday night, surveying the mayhem in Parliament Square caused by the fight over Churchill's monument, one ITV reporter saw an indictment of the entire country. He said, 'the lines that divide us are more deeply drawn and dangerous than ever'. Excuse me: no. It is highly impertinent to assume that what a mob of violent protesters thinks in any way reflects opinion in modern Britain, but this is the game our broadcast media plays. They take the most extreme views, amplify them and present them as if they were the only two choices available - as if the only options in life are madness or lunacy.'3.

Unlikely to ever be on a plinth of his own, this incompetent Prime Minister will do anything to divert public attention from his Government's disastrously world-beating pandemic record. OECD experts are predicting the UK will endure the costliest slump of any major economy on top of the globe's highest excess death toll. It is a poisonous double-whammy our country cannot afford. Johnson is a toppled Neville Chamberlain, not the reincarnated Winston Churchill of his dreams... Man of letters Dr Johnson's damning declaration that 'patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel' fits the plastic patriot PM in the 21st century, just as much as it did in the 18th as William Pitt self-consciously clothed himself in the flag to deflect criticism.'4. Claire Foges in The Timeson how criminalisation can detract from women's issueLet's not expand 'hate crime' even further[8]'This lack of clarity about what misogyny means could turn the hate crime of misogyny into a grudge vehicle for the #MeToo generation to settle scores and bother the police with incidents that are not worthy of their time. Which leads to the final test this fails: it is not enforceable. Yes, there would be a scattering of cack-handed follow-ups, Humberside police-style, but in general the police are (or should be) far too busy to deal with non-crime incidents... Instead of changing the law to make misogyny a hate crime, we must do better at using existing law to prosecute and punish those who hurt women and girls. There has, to date, been one single successful conviction for female genital mutilation (FGM) in the UK. Rape charges, prosecutions and convictions in England and Wales are at their lowest levels in more than a decade; the number of prosecutions completed fell by 33 per cent over the year 2018-19. Then there is the odious 'rough sex defence', which has allowed dozens of men to claim that women died not as a result of murder but because consensual violent sex went wrong. It is in these areas that we should be pushing for more resources where required and more action where needed, not creating a new law that would open the floodgates to the reporting of trivial incidents.' -#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-For a round-up of the most important stories [9]from around the world - and a concise, refreshing and balanced take on the week's news agenda - try The Week magazine[10].

Yet Mr. Bush ultimately won the fall election by some three million popular votes and by an Electoral College tally of 286 to 251. The economy was not in collapse at that time, as it is today.

 Local leaders and the community are rallying behind the Sikh-owned restaurant, India Palace, in Santa Fe, which suffered $100,000 in damages during the attack discovered on Monday, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported.
 Besides causing extensive damage to the restaurant, the vandals had written slogans in support of President Donald Trump and ""White Power"", and racist remarks like ""Go Home,"" according to the Santa Fe Reporter.
 It said that the kitchen was completely made unusable, tables were overturned, glassware was smashed, wine racks were emptied, the statue of a ""goddess"" was beheaded and computers were stolen.
 The restaurant had reopened only recently after being closed due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
 Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted on Tuesday, ""We will not stand for such hatred in New Mexico."" She added that she had spoken to restaurant-owner Bajit Singh to ""let him know that our community is with him.""
 Mayor Alan Webber described the vandalism a ""sickening and appalling"" hate crime and vowed, ""We will find whoever did it and punish them to the full extent of the law.""
 He said, ""The Singhs are a long-standing Sikh family that has used its own resources to feed homeless Santa Feans through the goodness of their hearts. For them to be attacked this way breaks our hearts.""
 The Singh family distributes free packages of food and sanitary products for homeless people in the area and these items were stolen during the attack, according to the Reporter.
 The Reporter said that five fundraising campaigns have been launched to help the restaurant.
 A 'GoFundMe' campaign by another restaurant Paper Dosa had raised more than $35,000, the New Mexican said.
 One of the pictures of the graffiti posted on the Reporter's website was against the terrorist organisation Islamic State.
 Because of their turbans, Sikhs are sometimes mistaken for Islamists or Iranian clergy who are represented in the media with turbans and are attacked.
 The Council on American-Islamic Relations National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said in a statement, ""This disturbing hate attack once again demonstrates that growing white supremacy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism target every minority community and must be challenged by people of all races, faiths and backgrounds.""

In response to a public expression of lawful political speech, ""safety officers"" come to the person's home at midnight to interrogate him. He is accused of intimidation, making threats, hate crimes, and disorderly conduct. He is found guilty and his punishment includes exclusion from the community, suspension of his academic privileges, a ban on taking leadership roles in campus organizations, mandatory meetings with appropriate officials to learn about correct ways of thinking and speaking, and the presentation of a formal written apology, to be submitted in draft form ""for approval.""
Readers would be excused for assuming that this occurred in some backward, repressive dictatorship or totalitarian regime, but these troubling events took place at an American University.
Austin Tong, a senior at Fordham University in New York State, posted two messages on his Instagram account. The first, on June 3, was a comment about the ""nonchalant societal reaction"" to the killing of David Dorn, a black, retired St. Louis Police officer. His second post, a day later, was a photo of himself holding his lawfully owned AR-15 rifle at his off-campus home. This was captioned, ""Don't tread on me,"" followed by the emojis of the American and Communist Chinese flags and a hashtag ""commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.""
Mr. Tong is a Chinese-American who arrived in the United States as a six-year-old immigrant. He explained that his second post was made to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the suppressed 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement.
According to Mr. Tong, the university ""sent safety officers at midnight to interrogate me all over a simple picture of a lawfully owned gun."" Keith Eldredge, Fordham University's Dean of Students and Assistant Vice President, followed up by advising that he was initiating an investigation for bias/hate crimes, threats/intimidation, and disorderly conduct, based on these ""posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one in which you were holding an automatic weapon.""
Fordham University a private educational institution that is not bound by the First Amendment nonetheless professes its commitment to free speech and expressive rights. For example, its mission statement ""guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.""
The university's Demonstration Policy opens with the following: ""By its very nature, the University is a place where ideas and opinions are formulated and exchanged. Each member of the University has a right to freely express their positions and to work for their acceptance whether they assent to or dissent from existing situations in the University or society."" Similarly, Fordham's policy on ""Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes"" claims the University:
values freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas. The expression of controversial ideas and differing views is a vital part of University discourse. Although the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others, it may not constitute a hate crime or bias-related incident. While this value of openness protects the expression of controversial ideas, it does not protect or condone harassment or expressions of bias or hate aimed at individuals or groups that violate the Student Code of Conduct.
Regardless of these high-minded affirmations, the University concluded that Mr. Tong's posts devoid of threats, violence, intimidation, coercion, or harassment violated the university rules on ""Bias and/or Hate Crimes"" and ""Threats/Intimidation.""
A July 14 letter from Keith Eldredge (copied to the ""Department of Public Safety"") outlined the sanctions. Mr. Tong would be barred from the campus for the duration of his degree program. He was banned from representing the university or running for any student office or position. He would be required to attend instruction and complete activities on ""implicit bias,"" including a meeting with staff of the ""multicultural affairs"" office. He would have to submit a mandatory ""apology letter,"" to be approved by the university and a failure to comply would result in the university suspending or expelling him.
Perversely, the social media backlash to these innocuous posts has itself resulted in threats, intimidation, and potential bias/hate crimes against Austin Tong. It will be interesting to see whether Fordham University will enforce the same rules and policies against the activists from the university that ""flooded the comments section"" of his posts.
In the same way that the ""quest for truth"" supported characterizing his firearm indiscriminately as an ""automatic weapon,"" the university's commitments to ""freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas"" protected Austin Tong, who was ""forcibly silenced, faced verbal and assaulting harassment from mobs, and subjected to Soviet-style interrogation and punishment."" Despite this, and the possibility that his academic career will be marred indefinitely due to these disciplinary actions, he has been steadfast in his defense of his constitutional rights.
In a video for the NRA, Austin Tong describes his decision to purchase a gun, adding that ""[h]ere in America, we have our right to keep and bear arms. This is what keeps America free.""
Actually, Austin, it is patriots like you who fight to protect our constitutional freedoms that keep America free."

A 23-year-old Louisiana man was sentenced on Monday to 25 years in prison for setting fire to three predominantly Black churches in what federal prosecutors say was an effort to raise his profile as a “black metal” musician.
The man, Holden James Matthews, 23, who burned down the churches over a 10-day period ending on April 4, 2019, was also ordered to pay nearly $2.7 million to the churches. He pleaded guilty in federal court in February to three counts of violating the Church Arson Prevention Act and to one count of using fire to commit a felony.
Prosecutors did not mention race as a factor in the charges, but the church arsons evoked a long history of racist crimes committed across the Jim Crow South.
“These churches trace their origins to the post-Civil War Reconstruction period,” Eric S. Dreiband, assistant attorney general of the civil rights division in the Justice Department, said in a statement on Monday. “The churches survived for nearly 150 years but did not survive this defendant’s warped act of hatred.”
At his sentencing in United States District Court in Lafayette, La., Mr. Matthews addressed congregants of the churches he had burned and apologized, according to The Acadiana Advocate of Lafayette.
“There are not enough words in the English language to say how sorry I am,” the newspaper quoted Mr. Matthews as saying. “If I could go back and change it I would.”
The churches Mr. Matthews set ablaze were St. Mary Missionary Baptist Church in Port Barre, and Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, both in Opelousas.
At the sentencing, Judge Robert R. Summerhays of the Western District of Louisiana gave Mr. Matthews credit for the 18 months that he has been in custody since his arrest in April 2019, about two weeks after the third church fire, The Advocate reported.
Mr. Matthews has also pleaded guilty to six state charges in connection with the blazes, including aggravated arson of a religious building and three hate crime counts. His sentencing is pending.
Mr. Matthews has admitted that he targeted the churches because of their religious character, according to prosecutors.
Mr. Matthews has also said that he was copying similar crimes committed in Norway in the 1990s in an effort to elevate his status among the black metal community, whose most extreme practitioners have engaged in church burning, vandalism and killings. Black metal is a subgenre of heavy metal, known for its unique blend of howls, nonsyncopated blast-beat drums and cold, trebly guitars.
Mr. Matthews posted pictures and videos of the church burnings on Facebook, and discussed them with a friend online, prosecutors said. In one message to a friend, which prosecutors presented in court as evidence, Mr. Matthews mentioned a possible name for his would-be record label: “Soul Rotting Records, ‘music to burn to,’” he wrote.
Dustin Charles Talbot, a lawyer for Mr. Matthews, did not immediately return a telephone call or an email seeking comment on Monday night. In February, Mr. Talbot said that Mr. Matthews had the social and mental development of an adolescent, and that his actions were not motivated by the racial makeup of the congregations.
“Holden now fully understands the seriousness and gravity of his actions and is deeply remorseful for what he has done and the pain he has caused the congregations of these churches,” Mr. Talbot said.
Mr. Matthews was arrested after investigators determined that his debit card was used to buy a gas can that was found at the scene of one of the fires.
In April, The Advocate reported that the three churches were in various stages of reconstruction. The land had been cleared at Mount Pleasant, and the church was awaiting an inspection to begin foundation work.
Donations to help rebuild the churches poured in last year, surpassing the organizers goal of $1.8 million.

Congresswoman Lowey (D-NY17/Rockland-Westchester), Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, and the Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, today approved by voice vote the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security funding bill. The $50.72 billion proposal includes $10.8 billion for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and $3.66 billion for Federal Assistance, which includes funding for the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) Nonprofit Security Grants and the newer non-UASI Nonprofit Security Grants within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (NSGP-S) that Chairwoman Lowey created in FY 2018. The increases of $473.9 million above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $1.18 billion above the President’s budget request for Federal Assistance include record-level funding for the nonprofit security grants.
“In response to the rise in anti-Semitic incidents and violent hate crimes, our draft bill quadruples funds for nonprofits and religious institutions to help prevent and protect against terrorism and targeted, violent extremism,” said Congresswoman Lowey. “The record funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI and non-UASI regions would enable the Westchester, Rockland, and the broader New York nonprofit community to protect themselves with increased security measures and greater peace of mind so that they can gather safely. It brings me great pride to know that a program I created is helping to keep children and families safe and secure across the Lower Hudson Valley. As the appropriations process continues, I will keep fighting to bring home increased funding for New York.”
Combined funding for nonprofit security grants in both UASI (NSGP-U) and non-UASI regions (NSGP-S) was $90 million in FY 2020. The House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee approved a combined funding level of $360 million in the FY 2021 bill, which would be an increase of $270 million, or a quadrupling of funding, for nonprofit security grants. Individually, NSGP-S would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, marking a $140 million increase from $40 million in FY 2020. The NSGP-U would receive a record $180 million in FY 2021, which would be a $130 million increase from $50 million in FY 2020. The bill is expected to be considered by the full Appropriations Committee in the coming days.
In FY 2018, Congresswoman Lowey successfully created the Nonprofit Security Grant Program carve-out within the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) to support nonprofit organizations located outside of UASI-designated urban areas, such as Rockland County. The new program was originally funded at $10 million in FY 2018. As Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Lowey was instrumental in securing an increase of $30 million in FY 2020 to support nonprofit security. Last week, the Congresswoman announced that at least 25 organizations in the 17th Congressional District will receive a total of $2,565,028 of those federal funds."

Protections in Italy Spurs Rallies on Both Sides",FALSE,"Supporters frame the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights. Opponents depict it as an overreaching step that would suppress opinion. 
ROME - Protesters turned out in force on Saturday for rival demonstrations on a bill that would make anti-L.G.B.T. violence a hate crime carrying harsher penalties than under current law, coming out by the hundreds in Rome despite a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the country. 
Demonstrations were planned throughout the country ahead of a parliamentary vote planned for this coming week, with supporters framing the measure as a long-overdue means to provide basic human rights and protection from attack, and opponents depicting it as an overreaching step that would also suppress opinion and religious beliefs. 
""We have been through centuries of discrimination,"" said Marlon Landolfo, 21, who recounted a vicious homophobic attack on him and another man in northern Italy last month. ""Now it's 2020 and we are still discussing a law that protects us for what we are."" 
The bill under debate would explicitly recognize anti-L.G.B.T. and anti-women hate crimes and hate speech by including those offenses under an existing law that makes discrimination, violence or incitement to violence based on someone's race or religion a crime punishable by up to four years in prison. 
Current law does not have a specific designation for such offenses against L.G.B.T. people, and as a result, homophobic or transphobic assaults are tried on lesser charges than racially motivated or anti-Semitic ones. 
The bill, which appears to have the support of a parliamentary majority, makes discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity an aggravating circumstance, which could mean added time to sentences. 
Decades of efforts and multiple attempts to extend protections to L.G.B.T people have failed in Italy, making the country an outlier among Western European democracies such as Britain, France and Spain. Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016 but does not allow same-sex marriage. 
Within the European Union, it is joined by Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria in not responding to European Parliament appeals for member states to prosecute hate crimes and hate speech motivated by homophobia and transphobia. 
Supporters of the bill face resistance from traditional opponents such as conservatives and the Roman Catholic Church, but also from some less expected corners, such as one group of feminists. 
Proponents say a change would allow the authorities to keep statistics on homophobic and transphobic attacks, provide a deterrent and send a clear message that these are hate crimes. 
Mr. Landolfo, his ankle still sore after a beating last month in the city of Padua, said he felt disheartened by the debate around the new bill. He and another young man, Mattias Fascina, had held hands and exchanged a quick kiss during a date on a September night when a gang mocked them, then punched and kicked them while shouting homophobic slurs. Under Italian law, the pair cannot be considered victims of a hate crime. 
The attack on Mr. Landolfo is not an isolated case. Arcigay, Italy's leading L.G.B.T. association, records more than 100 episodes of violence, hate and discrimination every year. In September, in the northern city of Novara, a man kicked his lesbian neighbor and broke her nose. In the city of Bergamo, residents of an apartment complex insulted and threatened two homosexual neighbors, prompting them to temporarily move out of their apartment. 
""These episodes rarely turn into official complaints,"" said Francesca Rupalti, a lawyer with Rete Lenford, a network of lawyers for L.G.B.T. rights. ""Without a specific law, it is hard to prove homophobic acts."" 
Alessandro Zan, a member of Parliament with the center-left Democratic Party who proposed the bill, said its ratification would denote a significant cultural shift in a society with deep patriarchal and conservative roots. 
""These people are particularly exposed to hate crimes,"" he said. ""This is why we particularly need to protect them."" 
Unlike the United States, where speech is largely protected by the First Amendment, Italy and many other European countries scarred by fascism and Nazism have stricter laws against preaching racial or ethnic superiority. They have also outlawed blatantly discriminatory associations or groups. 
""Laws need to balance freedom of expression and hatred,"" Mr. Zan said. ""This law says clearly that discriminating against L.G.B.T. people and inciting violence against them is not an opinion."" 
Some opponents of the bill say it will cross the line into censorship. They have presented hundreds of amendments - including one that mockingly asked to extend protection to bald or white-haired people - in order to slow down the legislative process. 
One objection is that the bill, which opponents have dubbed a ""gag law,"" could be used to suppress dissenting opinions about same-sex marriage or adoption by homosexual couples. A prominent opponent, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the nationalist League party, said the bill ""puts ideas on trial"" and has insisted that Italy does not discriminate anyway. 
Supporters say the bill would not infringe on free speech or religious liberty. Groups or individuals, they say, will still be able to promote and discuss their values as long as they do not engage in violent behavior or incite violence and hatred. 
The nationalist and conservative political opposition has been joined by Italy's Catholic bishops. That has unnerved advocates for the bill who had been encouraged by tolerant remarks from Pope Francis. The pope told a gay man in 2018 that God had made him that way, and in 2013 famously said ""Who am I to judge?"" when asked about a priest said to be gay - a dramatic change of tone in Vatican comments on homosexuality. 
But the Italian bishops conference, which is influential in domestic politics, has argued that the measure could criminalize expression of the church's belief that marriage should be between a woman and a man, if it were interpreted as incitement to discrimination. 
The bishops said in a statement that Italian law already has tools available to punish violent and discriminatory behavior, and that adding more ""incriminatory norms"" would threaten liberty. 
Some opponents from the left have also joined the fight against the proposed law. Although many leading feminist groups in the Western world have expressed support for L.G.B.T. protections, a group of well-known Italian feminists has criticized the pending bill for embracing a broader definition of women by using the term ""gender identity,"" which would include transgender women. 
In an open letter published on a notable feminist website, the 13 signatories argued that the progress made against sexual discrimination against women in Italy would be undercut if the broader concept of gender identity is applied. 
Francesca Izzo, a former member of Parliament with the Democratic Party who signed the letter, said that while it was important to fight homophobia and transphobia, it was a separate issue from the overall rights of women. 
Proponents of the law reject that argument. 
Mr. Zan, the lawmaker, said that feminists and L.G.B.T. people were fighting the same battle. ""Violence against L.G.B.T. people is just another consequence of sexism,"" he said. ""Anatomy is not a person's destiny."" "

Tong Calls on Facebook to Take Stronger Steps to Prevent Use of Its Platforms to Spread Hate and Disinformation",FALSE,"Connecticut Attorney General William Tong issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General William Tong today joined 19 attorneys general from across the United States in calling on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent their site from being used to spread hate and disinformation. The attorneys general also urged Facebook to provide stronger support for users who fall victim to online intimidation and harassment on its platforms.
In a letter today to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, the attorneys general assert that despite its stated commitment to working to keep its user community safe, Facebook has fallen short in keeping hate content off its platforms and protecting users from online harassment.
The letter follows the release of a Civil Rights Audit of Facebook's practices -- commissioned by the company and completed in July--that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights, and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and that of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook.
""Trolls, hate groups and foreign actors use Facebook as a weapon of choice to spread vile and racist disinformation. Facebook can and must do more to protect its users from hate speech, harassment and intimidation,"" said Attorney General Tong.
The reforms recommended in today's letter, many of which are highlighted in the recent Civil Rights Audit, include calls for Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations;
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement;
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance; and
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups;
The Attorneys General also recommends steps to enhance Facebook supportive services including:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment;
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available; and
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
In addition to Connecticut, attorneys general representing the following jurisdictions are participating in today's letter: California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont and Wisconsin. The letter was led by New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.
Based on our collective experience, we believe that Facebook should take additional actions including the following steps--many of which are highlighted in Facebook's recent Civil Rights Audit--to strengthen its commitment to civil rights and fighting disinformation and discrimination:
* Aggressively enforce Facebook policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations: Although Facebook has developed policies against hate speech and organizations that peddle it, we remain concerned that Facebook's policies on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations, including but not limited to its policies on white nationalist and white supremacist content, are not enforced quickly and comprehensively enough./9 Content that violates Facebook's own policies too often escapes removal just because it comes as coded language, rather than specific magic words. And even where Facebook takes steps to address a particular violation, it often fails to proactively address the follow-on actions by replacement or splinter groups that quickly emerge.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement: To gauge the ongoing progress of Facebook's enforcement efforts, independent experts should be permitted access to the data necessary to conduct regular, transparent third-party audits of hate and hate-related misinformation on the platform, including any information made available to the Global Oversight Board. As part of this effort, Facebook should capture data on the prevalence of different forms of hate content on the platform, whether or not covered by Facebook's own community standards, thus allowing the public to determine whether enforcement of anti-hate policies differs based on the type of hate content at issue.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance: By funneling users toward particular types of content, Facebook's content population scheme, including its algorithms, can push users into extremist online communities that feature divisive and inflammatory messages, often directed at particular groups. Although Facebook has conducted research and considered programs to reduce this risk, there is still no mandatory guidance for coders and other teams involved in content population. Facebook should commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of its content population scheme, including its algorithms, and also continuously implement mandatory protocols as best practices are identified to curb bias and prevent recommendations of hate content and groups.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups: Although Facebook currently prohibits ads that claim that certain people, because of their membership in a protected group, pose a threat to the physical safety of communities or the nation, its policies still allow attacks that characterize such groups as threats to national culture or values.10 The current prohibition should be expanded to include such ads.
We also recommend the following measures to improve the supportive services that Facebook offers to users who have been or may become victims of harassment and intimidation on its platforms:
* Offer live real-time assistance: Facebook users can report intimidation and harassment but cannot immediately engage a Facebook employee who can promptly address issues that are occurring in real time. Victims of intimidation and harassment would benefit from more immediate access to Facebook employees who can offer prompt assistance. For example, if a user is being doxed, live assistance could help stop the spread of the user's personal information before the damage cannot be undone.
* Make information about harassment and intimidation more readily available: Facebook should facilitate evidence preservation and cooperate with victims and law enforcement agencies seeking evidence to prove a case of harassment or intimidation, such as cyberstalking or non-consensual distribution of intimate imagery, when the offenders use Facebook to perpetrate their crimes.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools: Facebook allows users to block individual people, but users should have stronger tools and more choices for filtering out and reporting hateful, intimidating, and harassing content they do not want to see in their feeds. For example, if members of a Facebook group are engaged in an organized campaign of harassment against a single user, the victim should be able to block all members of the group and report batches of posts or users without having to block or report each individually.
We urge Facebook to take these steps to better tackle hate in our society, and address the interests of users who are victimized by others in the online community that Facebook has built.

Josh Stein to Facebook: Stop the Spread of Hate and Disinformation",FALSE,"North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein issued the following news release on Aug. 5:
Attorney General Josh Stein today called on Facebook to take additional steps to prevent its platform from being used to spread hate and disinformation and support users who become victims of online intimidation and harassment.
""Keeping North Carolinians safe includes keeping them safe online,"" said Attorney General Josh Stein. ""The discrimination and hate that people experience online can have real and dangerous consequences for their safety and mental health. Facebook has repeatedly failed to protect users on its platform, and it must do more to stop people from becoming victims of harassment.""
In a letter today to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Attorney General Stein and 19 attorneys general assert that Facebook has fallen short of its stated commitment to keeping users safe and in keeping hate content off its platforms. Recent surveys suggest more than 40 percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, and of those victims, more than 75 percent have reported being harassed on Facebook. Much of the harassment reported by Facebook users focuses on characteristics protected by civil rights laws, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability. Such harassment can include conduct like cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt law enforcement response targeting the victim).
The letter follows the July release of a civil rights audit of Facebook's practices, commissioned by the company, that faults Facebook for failing to advance civil rights and refusing to enforce its own policies against dangerous organizations and individuals, including white supremacists and other extremists.
The attorneys general call for many reforms that were included in the audit and urge Facebook to:
* Aggressively enforce its policies against hate speech and organized hate organizations.
* Allow public, third-party audits of hate content and enforcement.
* Commit to an ongoing, independent analysis of Facebook's content population scheme and the prompt development of best practices guidance.
* Expand policies limiting inflammatory advertisements that vilify minority groups.
The attorneys general also recommend steps to enhance supportive services, including calling on Facebook to:
* Offer live real-time assistance to victims of intimidation and harassment.
* Make information about unlawful harassment and intimidation more readily available.
* Strengthen filtering, reporting, and blocking tools.
Attorney General Stein is joined in sending today's letter by the Attorneys General of California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

To: Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer, Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025
Dear Mr. Zuckerberg & Ms. Sandberg:
We, the undersigned State Attorneys General, write to request that you take additional steps to prevent Facebook from being used to spread disinformation and hate and to facilitate discrimination. We also ask that you take more steps to provide redress for users who fall victim to intimidation and harassment, including violence and digital abuse.
Our nation is in the midst of a reckoning on issues of racial justice and civil rights. As State Attorneys General, we have witnessed firsthand how the country's longstanding undercurrent of discrimination has burst into the open, as reports of hate crimes and bias incidents of all kinds have dramatically increased in recent years./1 And while recent events have further highlighted the systemic injustice that persists in our society, the last few months also have seen millions of Americans join together to call for action against bias and racism.
As you know, Facebook is not immune to these problems. Although Facebook has made some progress in counteracting the use of its platform to dehumanize and demean, that is just the beginning of what is necessary./2 Private parties, organized groups, and public officials continue to use Facebook to spread misinformation and project messages of hate against different groups of Americans. In many cases, these messages lead to intimidation and harassment of particular individuals online.
According to recent surveys, more than forty percent of Americans have experienced some form of online harassment, including cyberstalking, doxing (maliciously publishing someone's personal information), and swatting (filing false police reports to prompt a law enforcement response targeting the victim)./3 Of those Americans who report having been harassed online, more than three-quarters have reported being harassed on Facebook./4 Much of that harassment is focused on characteristics protected by the civil rights laws that many of us are charged with enforcing, including race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity, and disability./5 Recourse is unavailable for too many of these victims, due to limitations on the services that Facebook offers victims and other impediments to securing relief through civil lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.
We understand that Facebook has committed to the public and its users that it will ""invest billions of dollars each year to keep [Facebook's] community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update [Facebook's] policies.""/6 But, as the most recent Civil Rights Audit reveals, the steps you have taken thus far have fallen short. With the vast resources at your disposal, we believe there is much more that you can do to prevent the use of Facebook as a vehicle for misinformation and discrimination, and to prevent your users from being victimized by harassment and intimidation on your platforms.
As State Attorneys General, we are responsible for protecting the safety and wellbeing of all the communities we serve. As part of that mission, we must constantly contend with the impacts of online hate, intimidation, and harassment. Many of our offices enforce the laws that protect our residents from bias offenses, intimidation, and harassment--whether online or on our streets./7 And many of our offices include units dedicated to serving the victims of unlawful conduct, including helping them access and use tools that allow them to vindicate their rights. As part of our responsibilities to our communities, Attorneys General have helped residents navigate Facebook's processes for victims to address abuse on its platform. While Facebook has--on occasion--taken action to address violations of its terms of service in cases where we have helped elevate our constituents' concerns,/8 we know that everyday users of Facebook can find the process slow, frustrating, and ineffective. Thus, we write to highlight positive steps that Facebook can take to strengthen its policies and practices. We hope to work with you to ensure that fewer individuals suffer online harassment and discrimination, and that it is quickly and effectively addressed when they do.

Several offices at UNC Asheville received 'a direct threat' via email with demands to remove a Black Lives Matter mural on campus

A UNC Asheville spokesperson declined to reveal the nature of the direct threat
Students and staff at a North Carolina university were ordered to 'shelter in place' over threatening demands to remove a Black Lives Matter mural on campus.
Administrators with University of North Carolina Asheville first alerted its 3,600 students and additional faculty that something was amiss on Friday morning.
In a 'Bulldog Alert,' officials said that several offices at the institution received an email with 'a direct threat to members of the UNC Asheville community.'
'The email demanded that the Black Lives Matter mural on University Heights on campus be painted over.'
'A decision has been made to send a Bulldog Alert to all faculty, staff, and students to shelter in place until further notice.' 
The campus could reopen as soon as Saturday morning, but will remained closed on Friday. 
DailyMail.com reached out to UNC Asheville spokesperson Steve Plever, who declined to reveal the nature of the threat. 
But Plever added that if the matter is resolved by Friday afternoon, school officials may hold a press conference discussing the incident with media. 
In addition to in-person classes, virtual lessons and extracurricular activities were also cancelled. 
The Black Lives Matter mural being targeted was installed on September 30 on University Heights near campus.
According to the website, the colorful mural was created by black student artists and took around eight hours to complete. 
The mural was painted in permanent road paint, meaning it will 'remain on University Heights indefinitely.'
As of 11am, the campus remained under lockdown but administrators approved 'one on one or small group virtual connections' if people wanted to provide support for each other. 
A number of Black Lives Matter murals have adorned city streets from New York City to Los Angeles since George Floyd's death in May. 
His death reignited calls to end police brutality, racial inequality and hold law enforcement to higher procedural standards while on duty.
However, some Americans have gone out of their way to damage or vandalize the murals.
In one instance, a couple was charged with a hate crime after they painted over a Black Lives Matter mural in Martinez, California. "

This episode focuses on the immigrant experience of COVID-19 in Maine. The podcast is a product of a Feet in 2 Worlds,[2] a project of the New School in New York City. Maine has one of the lowest rates of coronavirus infection in the country, but Black residents of Maine are at a disproportionately high risk of becoming infected by COVID-19. A new episode of Feet in 2 Worlds[3]' podcast series 'A Better Life?[4]' released on Oct. 8 examines the reasons for this disparity, the widest of any state. The episode, 'Black Immigrants in the Whitest State,' focuses on Maine's rapidly growing African immigrant population, and why Black Mainers are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. The episode explores the connection between the pandemic and economic disadvantages experienced by Black people in Maine, notably migrants from African countries including Somalia, Angola, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In conversations with two prominent Mainers of African descent, we look at Maine's history of racial discrimination, including hate crimes and police abuses committed against Black people, as well as Maine's historic connections to the Ku Klux Klan, beginning in the 1920s. 'A Better Life?' is hosted by Zahir Janmohamed and produced by Mia Warren. Both Janmohamed and Warren are the children of immigrants. Janmohamedlives in Portland.

Democratic Members of the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled new legislation aimed at taking a comprehensive approach to police reform in America. The ""Justice in Policing Act"" seeks to address unchecked bias in the policing of communities of color, ban the use of excessive force by police officers, implement strong transparency measures, and hold police more accountable for their actions while on duty.
Congressman Eliot Engel is an original cosponsor of the ""Justice in Policing Act"" and says these reforms must be the top priority for lawmakers in Washington.
""Our country feels broken after the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, but the reality is it was broken long before these tragedies,"" Engel said. ""Communities of color have borne the brunt of unchecked bias and police brutality for centuries, and the systemic racism that exists in our society only exacerbates the problem. This glaring epidemic of police brutality has led millions of Americans to peacefully protest against an unjust system of law enforcement. Even as Americans conduct their Constitutional right to protest, the President and his party are supportive of efforts to crack down on these peaceful protestors, even threatening to deploy the U.S. military in our cities. Change must come, and instead of embracing necessary change, the President is only creating more division and resentment.
""The Justice in Policing Act, which I am proud to join as an original cosponsor, includes a host of necessary reforms that are vital to ending a police system that often terrorizes people of color. Our bill bans the use of chokeholds by police; it reduces the federal criminal statute to prosecute police misconduct, from 'willfulness' to a 'recklessness' standard; it creates a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problem-officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability; it mandates new training standards for officers including racial bias training; it limits transfer of military grade equipment to local law enforcement; and it finally makes lynching a federal hate crime, among many other reforms. Almost everything we have seen in the last few weeks that has left us hurting--from obvious racial bias and excessive force in policing, to lack of accountability and a militarized police force--is addressed in our bill.
""Those of us privileged enough to serve in Congress must understand the critical importance of this moment in our nation's history and rise to meet it with urgency. I am committed to doing just that. We know the system doesn't work for everyone, and we know we need to do big things quickly to change course. Law enforcement needs to be more accountable, transparent, and must protect communities of color, not instill fear in them. That is what our bill aims to ensure.""
The Justice in Policing Act includes the following reforms:
Hold police accountable in our courts by:
* Amending the mens rea requirement in 18 U.S.C. Section 242, the federal criminal statute to prosecute police misconduct, from ""willfulness"" to a ""recklessness"" standard;
* Reform qualified immunity so that individuals are not entirely barred from recovering damages when police violate their constitutional rights;
* Improve the use of pattern and practice investigations at the federal level by granting the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division subpoena power and incentivizing state attorneys general to conduct pattern and practice investigations;
* Incentivize states to create independent investigative structures for police involved deaths through grants; and
* Create best practices recommendations based on the Obama 21st Century Policing Task force.
Improve transparency into policing by collecting better and more accurate data of police misconduct and use-of-force by:
* Creating a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problem-officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability; and
* Mandate state and local law enforcement agencies report use of force data, disaggregated by race, sex, disability, religion, age.
Improve police training and practices by:
* Ending racial and religious profiling;
* Mandating training on racial bias and the duty to intervene;
* Banning no-knock warrants in drug cases;
* Banning chokeholds and carotid holds;
* Changing the standard to evaluate whether law enforcement use of force was justified from whether the force was reasonable to whether the force was necessary;
* Limiting the transfer of military-grade equipment to state and local law enforcement;
* Requiring federal uniformed police officers to wear body cameras; and
* Requiring state and local law enforcement to use existing federal funds to ensure the use of police body cameras.
Make lynching a federal crime by:
* Making it a federal crime to conspire to violate existing federal hate crimes laws.

Today, U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-NJ-09) joined Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA-33), Judy Chu (D-NY-27), and 147 House colleagues in a bipartisan letter calling on U.S. Attorney General William Barr to publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The members also call for Barr to provide regular updates regarding the active steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this hate.
""Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the pandemic they have experienced continued harassment, violence, and discrimination,"" the Members wrote. ""As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. These and numerous news reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to physical assaults.""
The Members continued, ""We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination against this community is un-American and will not be tolerated. Further, we would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.""
Rep. Pascrell's congressional district is home to some of the largest and most vibrant Asian-American and Pacific Islander populations in the United States. In March, Rep.

Today, Democratic Members of the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled new legislation aimed at taking a comprehensive approach to police reform in America. The Justice in Policing Act seeks to address unchecked bias in the policing of communities of color, ban the use of excessive force by police officers, implement strong transparency measures, and hold police more accountable for their actions while on duty.
Congressman Eliot Engel is an original cosponsor of the Justice in Policing Act and says these reforms must be the top priority for lawmakers in Washington.
Our country feels broken after the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, but the reality is it was broken long before these tragedies, Engel said. Communities of color have borne the brunt of unchecked bias and police brutality for centuries, and the systemic racism that exists in our society only exacerbates the problem. This glaring epidemic of police brutality has led millions of Americans to peacefully protest against an unjust system of law enforcement. Even as Americans conduct their Constitutional right to protest, the President and his party are supportive of efforts to crack down on these peaceful protestors, even threatening to deploy the U.S. military in our cities. Change must come, and instead of embracing necessary change, the President is only creating more division and resentment.
The Justice in Policing Act, which I am proud to join as an original cosponsor, includes a host of necessary reforms that are vital to ending a police system that often terrorizes people of color. Our bill bans the use of chokeholds by police; it reduces the federal criminal statute to prosecute police misconduct, from willfulness to a recklessness standard; it creates a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problem-officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability; it mandates new training standards for officers including racial bias training; it limits transfer of military grade equipment to local law enforcement; and it finally makes lynching a federal hate crime, among many other reforms. Almost everything we have seen in the last few weeks that has left us hurtingfrom obvious racial bias and excessive force in policing, to lack of accountability and a militarized police forceis addressed in our bill.
Those of us privileged enough to serve in Congress must understand the critical importance of this moment in our nations history and rise to meet it with urgency. I am committed to doing just that. We know the system doesnt work for everyone, and we know we need to do big things quickly to change course. Law enforcement needs to be more accountable, transparent, and must protect communities of color, not instill fear in them. That is what our bill aims to ensure.
The Justice in Policing Act includes the following reforms:
Hold police accountable in our courts by:
Amending the mens rea requirement in 18 U.S.C. Section 242, the federal criminal statute to prosecute police misconduct, from willfulness to a recklessness standard;
Reform qualified immunity so that individuals are not entirely barred from recovering damages when police violate their constitutional rights;
Improve the use of pattern and practice investigations at the federal level by granting the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division subpoena power and incentivizing state attorneys general to conduct pattern and practice investigations;
Incentivize states to create independent investigative structures for police involved deaths through grants; and
Create best practices recommendations based on the Obama 21st Century Policing Task force.
Improve transparency into policing by collecting better and more accurate data of police misconduct and use-of-force by:
Creating a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problem-officers from changing jurisdictions to avoid accountability; and
Mandate state and local law enforcement agencies report use of force data, disaggregated by race, sex, disability, religion, age.
Improve police training and practices by:
Ending racial and religious profiling;
Mandating training on racial bias and the duty to intervene;
Banning no-knock warrants in drug cases;
Banning chokeholds and carotid holds;
Changing the standard to evaluate whether law enforcement use of force was justified from whether the force was reasonable to whether the force was necessary;
Limiting the transfer of military-grade equipment to state and local law enforcement;
Requiring federal uniformed police officers to wear body cameras; and
Requiring state and local law enforcement to use existing federal funds to ensure the use of police body cameras.
Make lynching a federal crime by:
Making it a federal crime to conspire to violate existing federal hate crimes laws."

Would those who attacked her have paused because they would have feared crossing some legal rubicon?
It's all well and good having laws in statute books, but what anyone under physical criminal attack needs is help, primarily from either police capable of delivering a speedy and robust defence, or the attackers fearing that continuing the attack will reduce their chance of escape.
What comes after, how society deals with the crime through its judicial system, is a different matter.
But for now, we need to focus on rapid response to the crime-in-progress, and it's simply not logical to expect gardaí to be everywhere.
Even if we doubled the number of personnel it would have only a limited impact, and almost less in public perception than the cost of doing it.
But I can't help thinking technology and some imagination might give a better return.
Perhaps highly visible Garda drones should be commonplace, hovering over high-risk areas and connected to a command centre that can automatically feed images into facial recognition software.
They can be used to rush quickly to reported incidents, and while they can't physically intervene they can assist in the apprehension of criminal suspects by ground units.
Indeed, a group of criminals engaged in, say, a mugging, have an incentive to desist and flee because the drone can only track a few of them at a time.
Would putting more gardaí on motorbikes (guided by Drone Central) allow for a more rapid deployment?
Should those convicted be required to register their mobile phones with gardaí, and should carrying an unregistered device be made a criminal offence for convicted criminals? A sort of digital Asbo?
I can't claim to have any expertise in law enforcement, of course, and there will almost certainly be problems with the above suggestions, but surely some experimentation might help.
The NYPD cracking down on illegal street windscreen cleaners resulted in loads of warrant jumpers being accidentally located.
Many old-guard cops in New York city sneered when the ComStat crime tracking system was first mooted, but it became an important aid in identifying crime patterns and allowing for the better targeting of resources.
It played a significant role in the reduction of crime in New York in the 1990s.
One interesting point would be that such use of technology would possibly lead to an increase in reported crime, as citizens who currently may not bother to report crime because they have no faith in it being investigated might then do so.
Imagine an app where one could report ""low level"" crime like graffiti or vandalism or flytipping, knowing that every report adds to a better picture of where crime is or more importantly might occur, and allow for better deployment of resources.
The suggested use of much greater surveillance, through recognition software, data collection and eyes-in-the-sky, certainly warrants a debate about what sort of society do we want.
Do we want to live in a country like that? What if the choice is between the nominal freedom of less surveillance, where some gang of gurriers can kick your teeth in with both your and their privacy being respected, or a Garda drone either frightening them into stopping or guiding gardaí to your location?
What would you prefer? It probably depends on whether your mouth is filled with the slightly metallic taste of your own blood.
To paraphrase one of fiction's most hardline lawmen, who do you want to see arriving when you're being mugged?
A policeman or your attacker's human rights advocate?
Of course we must have human rights.
We have to be very careful about not accidentally stumbling into a police state.
I'm also very much a sceptic about throwing anyone in prison and throwing away the key.
It's incredibly expensive and for the most part it doesn't work.
Nor am I certain what the alternative is. But I do know one thing for certain. My personal safety, my liberty and right to walk this country without fear of assault is at least equal to the rights of the people who might assault me, and if the defence of those rights involves living in a society with a greater level of public surveillance, I can live with that.
I get that putting young people into a brutal prison system is almost guaranteed to make them criminals.
We should not see prison as primarily some sort of Old Testament form of revenge. We should also recognise that the likes of Norway has had great success in reducing juvenile crime by taking a more liberal and enlightened approach to incarceration.
I'm willing to look at all that and yes, if necessary, fund it with my taxes.
But what I'm not willing to tolerate is that I have to sacrifice my physical safety to reach that point.
Yes, prison should be about rehabilitation, but primarily it should be about keeping violent people physically away from the rest of us, and yes, that should be its primary function.
As part of that debate, there's much talk in recent times about the phrase 'defund the police'.
As slogans go, it's hard to imagine one which is so damaging to the cause it purports to advance. In fairness, for many of its advocates, 'defund the police' isn't about abandoning our law enforcement-free streets to thugs, but proactively spending on things that might prevent crime in the first place.
It's a perfectly noble aim. I just prefer the slogan in its original form: Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.
'If more surveillance is the price of not getting mugged, I can live with that'

94,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The Sunday Guardian (India)",2020-10-24,"1579 words",NA,NA,NA,"China is Public Enemy No. 1 in US election",FALSE,"India, Oct. 24 -- The 2020 US presidential election proves that the Indian-American community of some 4 million (almost half of them eligible to vote) has come of age.
I have been in New York for six weeks, observing that magnificent quadrennial ""circus"" also known as the Presidential elections.
Congress and the Supreme Court may go in and out of session, but the President is the Energizer Bunny of American politics-always on and ever present. In the last 11 elections with incumbent candidates, incumbents prevailed eight times.
More than 26 million Americans had voted at the time of writing, according to the US Elections Project, more than six times the number of votes cast by the same point in 2016. This is an all-time record, suggesting much great voter interest in the 2020 election.
My morning walk group in Washington Square Park, just behind our apartment block, includes immigrants of different ethnicities and races. All came here chasing the American dream.
The history of immigration in America is fascinating. In the 1920s, the US passed quota laws that restricted immigrants based on nationality. By the 1930s, the number of immigrants arriving in the US had fallen dramatically. As European Jews increasingly sought refuge outside Nazi-occupied countries, the US was building up its walls.
Following the Immigration and Naturalization Act 1965 that ended immigration based on national origins and prioritized highly skilled workers, thousands of Indians flocked to America, not fleeing a repressive political system, but in search of economic betterment. They were not refugees, but financial migrants, a disproportionate segment of them being middle class professionals-doctors, educators, researchers and managers.
Their children, first generation Americans, have come of age but retain interest in the home countries of their parents and grandparents.
Unlike those from authoritarian systems who were seduced by the Statue of Liberty's call to ""give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"", Indians have come to this magical land, the richest and most powerful country in the world, drawn by the promise of Ms Liberty: ""I lift my lamp beside the golden door.""
And they hit gold. The Indian-Americans have been spectacularly successful, with a median annual income of US$100,000, more than any other expatriate community.
Except for a brief period in the 1980s when some members of the Sikh community alleged persecution in India and were able to find sanctuary in the United States, the overwhelming majority of Indian immigrants came to climb upward in the democratic whirl and dust, and as acknowledged by every American leader in the last half century, they, too, made today's America.
At 4 million, Indian Americans constitute a mere 1.5% of the population but their impact on American politics can be disproportionate. Indian Americans are among the wealthiest and most educated of all immigrant groups in the US.
They are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the US and the second largest immigrant group after Mexicans. They are in professions that involve daily contact with people-doctors, teachers, cab drivers. And they are respected for their conformity to American laws and systems (with a couple of prominent exceptions).
Being a high-earning and educated immigrant group makes Indian Americans a very attractive pool of potential donors for political campaigns. In the current election season, they have emerged as significant donors.
According to recent surveys, almost 2 million Indian Americans are eligible to vote of whom about 500,000 live in the ""battleground states"".
The American Presidential electoral system is idiosyncratic. Although Americans vote directly for their President, he is formally elected by an electoral college of 538 electors, representing the total members of Congress (Senate and House of Representatives). However, the system is heavily skewed in favour of the more populous states. The 50 states, depending on their population, have wide disparity in the number of electors they send for the decisive vote.
However, once a candidate wins the popular vote in a state even by a margin of 50.1 to 49.9, the winner takes all the electors! In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton led in the polls and won nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, but she still lost.
Most states nearly always vote the same way and are considered Blue (Democrat) or Red (Republican), there are just a handful of states where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground or swing states and have a frightening importance.
With razor-thin margins in these regions, the widely dispersed Indian community could have the greatest impact in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.
And so, both candidates are spending millions on advertisements that target the Indian community, more than in any previous election.
President Donald Trump highlights his closeness to India and its Prime Minister, Joe Biden flaunts his Indian-Jamaican-American running mate Kamala Harris (she of the perpetual sneer).
The Chinese virus (and China itself) is a big issue in the elections. It has cost people their homes, their health, their jobs, their relationships, their lives.
Following 9/11, Islamic terrorism was Public Enemy No. 1 in America. Many Muslim visitors (including a prominent Indian actor) were intensively interrogated. After the annihilation of the previous version of the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, and the Islamic State, that dubious honour now belongs to China.
The public anger is palpable, aggravated by the statement by the Word Health Organization in early October that 10% of world's population has been infected (780 mn) and counting. Recent studies have been prominently reported, suggesting that the virus attacks every human organ, and causes cardiovascular, neurological, renal, biliary, hepatologic complications even after recovery, with former patients developing encephalopathy (altered brain function) ranging from short-term memory loss and difficulty with multitasking to confusion, stupor and coma.
With well over 200,000 dead and several million affected, America is angry with China, seeing the pandemic as an attack on the American homeland.
New York has just set up a special unit to deal with hate crimes against Chinese (or Chinese looking people), although political correctness demands that it be called the ""Asian Hate Crime Task Force"". It is the first ever task force to exclusively investigate crimes against a single race. Three of its prominent officers, whose picture was published by the Wall Street Journal, are Stewart Loo, Martin Chen, and Jacky Wong.
The commanding officer of the task force said the origins of the virus in China have led some people to blame the Chinese, while Stewart Loo is quoted as acknowledging that ""with Covid-19 and the whole anti-Asian sentiment, it's a very uncomfortable feeling being out in the public"". Probably this is why I see fewer Chinese-looking law enforcement officers on patrol that I did on earlier visits to New York.
The anti-China sentiment (Sinophobia) is widespread. US agencies are investigating Chinese researchers who joined American universities by concealing their active-duty status as members of the People's Liberation Army.
And the greatest self-goal scorer of all time, the Chinese Chairman of Everything, Xi Jinping, has threatened to retaliate by arresting US nationals living in China!
Joe Biden is focusing on Donald Trump's mishandling of the pandemic. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll, just 1/3 of all Americans approve of how the President has handled the crisis, while three fourth of Republicans do.
Donald Trump squarely blames China for lying to and deceiving America and the world, and claims to have stood up to Chinese belligerence and aggression.
His core constituency, white, non-college educated Americans, believes him. They want their country back from the ""Latino immigrants and the Muslims and the Chinese"", as a police officer put it to me as gently as he could. The call to make America great again resonates with them.
An interesting sidelight of this election is the battle of the juniors! Speaking a day ago to rich Indian Americans in Long Island, New York, not far from where I live, Donald Trump Jr, referred to his recent book, Liberal Privilege, that lists allegations of corruption against Hunter Biden (Joe Biden Jr). His punchline: ""(do) you think the Chinese gave Hunter Biden USD 1.5bn...because he was a great businessman or because they knew the Bidens could be bought...(Biden) is bad for India.""
Trump Jr pressed all the right buttons. Describing the Indian community as family oriented, hard-working and education oriented, Trump Jr recalled the President's rally with the Indian Prime Minister in Ahmedabad earlier this year as ""the biggest Trump rally probably ever"". The audience stood up to applaud.
One Indian professor (who emigrated to America 40 years ago) in my morning group told me: ""We have never felt so wanted""!

Stonington police said 39-year-old Philip Sarner, and Emily Orbay, 27, each listed as former residents of Nassau County, N.Y., "" were taken into custody in Brooklyn, N.Y., early Monday morning and charged as fugitives from justice following an almost two-week search.
The U.S. Marshals Service and New York City Police Department arrested the couple during the early morning hours, bringing to an end a search that started when the pair fled following an assault at the Quality Inn Mystic on Whitehall Avenue that left 59-year-old Chrystal Caldwell of Groton injured.
Shortly before noon on June 26, police were summoned to the Whitehall Avenue hotel after receiving two 911 calls reporting an assault of a hotel worker, later identified as Caldwell. While police were on their way to the hotel, they said a second, more violent attack occurred. Caldwell has maintained that the couple threatened extreme violence and made several degrading statements toward her, including calling her an ""old monkey"" and telling her that her life doesn't matter.
The police met Caldwell and hotel staff in the parking lot, at which time officers also spoke with Sarner and Orbay. Police said all three complained of injuries, and Caldwell was taken to Pequot Health Center while Sarner and Orbay were taken to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London.
Officers did not wait with the pair at L+M, which police said was due in part to concerns about and confusion over COVID-19 procedures, and surveillance video later showed the suspects arrive back at the hotel in a Lyft before immediately getting into their car and leaving. It took the suspects less than a minute to get in their car, and the police said they did not retrieve their belongings from inside the hotel.
Stonington police continued to investigate and on July 1, the department obtained warrants for both Sarner and Orbay from the New London State's Attorney. The warrant was later updated to include the bias and bigotry charges.
The department has received heavy criticism of its handling of the investigation. Stonington First Selectman Danielle Chesebrough said Monday that concerns over transparency led Police Chief J. Darren Stewart and members of the Board of Police Commissioners to request an independent, third-party review.
The town announced Friday that it had hired an independent consultant, attorney Frank E. Rudewicz of the Boston-based legal firm Blum Shapiro, to begin an investigation into the department's handling of the incident and review both its response and the department's policies.
Chesebrough said. ""Chief Stewart and (Commission Chairman) Henri Gourd have been very proactive and supportive of this review. I think, as far as bringing a request to the town, they know how important community trust is and this is an effort to enhance transparency.""
The contract will require the town to pay for services ""not to exceed $15,000"" that will include a formalized review and report, which will be made public, for both the incident and other department policies, including use of force and police intervention.
The town continues to work with Rudewicz to establish a timeline for the investigation.
Chesebrough said, ""This is very much a time-sensitive matter and I expect there will be an aggressive timeline.We need to make sure this doesn't continue to drag on, but we want to make sure there is a thorough, complete review that will help identify any areas where maybe things could be done more efficiently.""
Sarner and Orbay are both charged with third-degree assault and intimidation based on bigotry and bias, Connecticut's statute for hate crimes. Sarner was also hit with one count of second-degree assault.
The two will be held in custody until deported from New York, police said. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

or friends or colleagues, so that is why they need to sometimes go out and meet people who are in the same position you know, share similar stories, so it is very vital for LGBTQ people to have these spaces. When this outbreak became public, the South Korean government wants to track and trace everyone who's infected, to try to stop the virus spreading. Why was that a real problem in Itaewon? So, these clubs and bars actually took their visitors' and customers' names and cellphone numbers and where they live. 
A lot of the people didn't write their information correct because the fear of being outed, and if the results were positive, then the information will be revealed on the internet, without the name, but just enough information for people to guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you here because you are talking about risk, you're talking about a risk to public health if people don't give their but you are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a real struggle there, or do some people have a real struggle with this? For being out and proud activists and artists, but there are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists who work for LGBTQ organisations, many of them are not out, and they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. Heezy Yang, before coronavirus, do you think things were getting easier? When you talk about Pride gatherings and parades in Seoul, for example, was that possible, were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general, things seemed to be going well, and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the festival for about 10 years now, and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2,000 or 3,000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big, in general, and mainstream media, and K-pop even included, not, like, very out and loud more queer and LGBTQ factors and culture little by little, so things seemed to be going to the right direction but then this one outbreak happened and people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually as good as they seemed or there have always been problems. Heezy Yang in South Korea. You are watching Coronavirus: Your Stories. I'm Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American basis. So I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store a day after the shelter-in-place order was officially announced here in New York City, and there were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me so close to the point where I could almost feel his breath, and he didn't have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, chink?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-reporting"

Speaking about a group of people living in the Chung Pak complex for senior citizens in Manhattan's Chinatown, he said, ""They have opened up every can they have in the house, trying to stretch them for another day or two.""
Since mid-March, UA3 has teamed up with the Trader Joe's grocery store chain, other NGOs and city officials to provide badly-needed food to these people. Hong described the supplies as a lifeline for the seniors.
""The problem they are facing is twofold. On the one hand, the seniors, who mostly have various ailments, are afraid to go out in case they become infected. On the other, they are frightened by all the racism that has bubbled to the surface since the pandemic hit this country,"" Hong said.
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak in New York City in March and April, when the death toll peaked at more than 800 within 24 hours, everyone－caregivers, attendants and even family members－stopped visiting the seniors.
Sam Wu, superintendent of the Chung Pak complex, said: ""The overwhelming majority of the more than 110 residents are in their 80s. We also have a handful of others in their 90s and a couple more who are over 100. Infirm, and sometimes immobile, they were cut off from food sources.""
Beatrice Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, another NGO based in New York, quickly responded to the challenges seniors faced.
She and her colleagues mobilized a group of volunteers, who ensured that bags of fresh produce were delivered to the homes of those badly in need.
Chen said that at the start of the outbreak everywhere was closing－""the butcher's around the corner, nearby Chinese supermarkets, neighborhood Chinese restaurants, centers for seniors and family associations"".
By mid-March even the pantries that catered to the city's poor had been closed. ""Some of them had still been serving meals. People went in and ate－that was obviously a large gathering. Many more (pantries) simply could not find enough people to help handle and serve food safely,"" Chen said.
""We started to realize all the logistical implications if we were to open a standard pantry, where people line up to get their food. Standing in line for half an hour not only exposes seniors to a greater risk of being infected, but also is physically and mentally exhausting,"" she added.
The Community First Food Pantry Program now delivers about 250 bags of groceries twice a week to the Chung Pak residents as well as others living in tenement buildings in Chinatown and the Lower East Side, where there are huge populations of seniors.
Referring to city councilwoman Margaret Chin, the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, Chen said, ""Donald Hong approached Margaret who, thanks to her constituent services, really knows where these hard-to-reach people are.
""Every building has its own rules, and you cannot just drop off fresh produce that could rot and attract rats. We often have to go a day in advance to make sure that the tenants will be at home when we deliver. One thing the seniors really miss is meat.""
Every morning, a Trader Joe's truck carrying food arrived in Lower Manhattan, and the supplies were unloaded at 2 am.
Hong said: ""Think about 50 crates of bananas and 340 crates of eggs. We seemed to be the only pantry in Lower Manhattan dealing with fresh, perishable food, as we wanted to give people a familiar taste.""
All the food was sorted and stored at a 200-square-meter pantry owned by Chung Pak Local Development Corp, and previously occupied by a restaurant that closed due to the pandemic.
Severe damage
Charles Lai, executive director of Chung Pak LDC, who helped found the Museum of Chinese in America in New York in 1980, said, ""Only by joining hands can we possibly reach out to those who are in desperate need of help yet are hiding themselves out of fear.
""The damage our community has suffered, physically and economically, is much more severe than in most other communities. Why? Because we have a president who calls this virus the Chinese virus, and in doing so has repeatedly evoked the country's (United States) racist history, making it unsafe for us at a time when all Americans need to stand together.""
A report released by the New York Police Department shows that hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen consistently in recent months. City officials and local NGOs suspect that such incidents are underreported.
A paper issued by two NGOs－the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action－said New York state has the second-highest number of cases of discrimination related to COVID-19, after California.
Hong, citing examples of Asian Americans being physically and verbally attacked on the New York Subway, said: ""Before COVID-19, 40 percent of the people we served at our Midtown pantry on 26th Street were Asian Americans. That proportion has dropped to below 10 percent, although we now have a line that stretches for three blocks. Members of our community are not coming.""
Lai, the executive director, said: ""The impact of COVID-19 was palpably felt here even before it landed on American shores. Back in late January, when we were preparing to celebrate Chinese New Year, people were already staying away from Chinatown and Chinese businesses. After the pandemic, Chinatown will be the last place that people choose to return to.""
Business closures mean lost jobs, sometimes for an entire family, and it is not uncommon for different generations of Chinese American families in Manhattan's Chinatown to run enterprises such as restaurants.
Early last month, CNN reported that about 147,000 Asian workers in New York state had filed for unemployment benefit in the past four weeks, a 6,900 percent rise over the same period last year. The number of such filings by white workers rose by 1,840 percent and among black workers by 1,260 percent.
Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, said: ""I know people who have started rationing food among three generations of a family. Waiting for unemployment benefit－which takes months to apply for－and not knowing when they will get their jobs back, they are trying to make their food reserves last a bit longer.
""You don't really hear these stories, because they're not being told. People are also largely unaware of those who are being excluded from most federal, state and local funding resources.""
Some 1,200 meals a week are now being provided by UA3, supported by Trader Joe's and other sources. In addition to caring for seniors, the NGO provides a home for the deaf in New York and another building for the visually impaired.
Chi Loek, a UA3 board member, said: ""We are pushing to expand our services. Food insecurity is going to be with us not just for months, but for years, and will be compounded by other factors, such as housing. What we are doing right now is intended not as an emergency measure, but as a sustainable, long-term solution to a problem that might grow.""
With this in mind, UA3 last week moved its food pantry to Grand Street in Lower Manhattan, where it is expected to reach out to more people in need. The Chung Pak residents continue to be served.
Kathleen Tom-Lew, a third-generation Chinese born and raised in Chinatown, has been working as a volunteer at the Chung Pak pantry since March, and makes deliveries in the heart of Chinatown.
""Originally, we only wanted to serve the elderly, but then other tenants who were out of a job asked to be put on our list,"" said Tom-Lew, a co-founder of the New York nonprofit Chinatown Community Young Lions.
Hong and Loek from UA3 scouted Chinatown and other areas of New York to find restaurants serving Chinese food that met the NGO's standards.
""These restaurants are funded by the city to provide ready-made meals for our program. While the seniors have something that is friendly on the stomach, the money is being funneled to local Chinese businesses,"" he said.
Chen, reflecting on the situation in Chinatown since January, said: ""Citywide, we've never been considered a top priority when it comes to a time like this. Usually, there are other neighborhoods that are much worse-off than ours, but this is different. It's unprecedented.""
The lives of local Chinese Americans, including active participants in community work, have been lost during the pandemic, including that of Jean Lau Chin, an avid collector of oral histories in Chinatown.
Just two people from the Chung Pak complex－a 97-year-old woman and a 105-year-old man－have died since the outbreak, but neither from COVID-19.
According to an article in The New York Times in the middle of last month, one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the US had been reported among nursing home residents and workers.
Wu, the superintendent, said: ""Since early March, we have provided masks to everyone entering the building, including caregivers and volunteers. If anyone leaves the building and then re-enters, we give them a new mask. We also give them protective eyewear and thoroughly spray and disinfect everyone.""
Referring to the seniors, who have been told not to go outside, he said, ""We've gone out of our way to meet their needs and will continue to do so.""
Tom-Lew, who has been joined by her entire family in volunteering to help the elderly in Chinatown, spoke of the heart-warming response she has received.
""Officially, we are supposed to limit our contact only to those we are delivering to, for obvious reasons. But people wanted to thank us for our kindness by giving us something in return, such as a water bottle. One lady, who is in her 70s and ethnically Chinese, even gave me packs of gum,"" she said.
""When the pandemic was raging in late March and early April, tenants would open the door slightly, allowing us to pass through the food bags. However, we often put the bags outside on the floor, knocked on the door and then walked away.
""Before we left the floor, we could hear the squeaky sound of a door opening, followed by a shout down the hallway of 'thank you'.""

He visited counties in the Capital Region 15 times; Western New York 6 times; Central New York 8 times; the Rochester-Finger Lakes 12 times; the Southern Tier 10 times; the Hudson Valley 14 times; the North Country 8 times; and Long Island 13 times.
""22 years ago, upon my election to the United States Senate in 1998, I promised that each and every year I served, I would visit all 62 of New York State's diverse counties. Not only has this ritual remained a steadfast passion of mine because of all I learn from my constituents and bring to Washington, D.C. as both a senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate,"" said Senator Schumer . ""Especially this year, when New York battled the global health and economic pandemic especially hard, visiting all 62 counties was vital for me to learn firsthand the struggles and needs of New Yorkers, from one end of the state to the other. Through a year that much has changed I, too, traveled with masks and disinfectant in tow to much smaller and more understated events one thing remained the same: my commitment, dedication, and love for New York. This year, more than ever before, I learned more about the struggles and needs of New York and saw New Yorkers resilience, perseverance, and grit and time and time again the very best New York has to offer even during our darkest of days.""
Schumer added , ""Although I've gained the title of Senate Democratic Leader, my proudest and most principal titles have been, and will always remain, New York's Senator and 'New Yorker.' At the close of twenty-two years, my beliefs are as clear as ever: 'Senators who stay in Washington and never return home are simply not doing their job.' Although this year looked a little different with online or-socially distanced events and celebrations, that's why I safely go to all of the places that I can. Whether I'm celebrating a virtual high school graduation or fighting for our first responders all over the state, I'm always learning more about New York directly from my constituents.""
Some of the key highlights include:
New York State
Delivered $167 Billion For New York In COVID Relief: During negotiations for the CARES Act, Schumer worked for days to deliver a plan that best protected New York's workers, small businesses, and health centers so they could receive the help they needed amidst the COVID crisis. The CARES Act Included:
Over $37 billion In Federal Funding For 'Unemployment Insurance On Steroids' Relief For New Yorkers: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer successfully fought for and secured a historic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance (UI). Importantly, economists have credited the UI expansion with mitigating a larger increase in poverty. The Senator conceived this plan with an understanding of how the modern New York economy functions, expanding unemployment benefits to more than 1.8 million freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors, and other workers in non-traditional employment across New York State since the start of the pandemic. The extended and expanded UI programs in the CARES Act also increased the maximum unemployment benefit amount by $600 per week above one's base unemployment compensation benefit for four months and ensured that workers who were laid-off or out of work through no fault of their own, on average, received their full pay for a full quarter. Additionally, Senator Schumer secured 100% federal financing of benefits paid through existing state Shared Work programs, allowing thousands of New York employers to avoid layoffs during the downturn by connecting their employees who are working reduced hours with partial UI compensation.
$10.7 Billion In Emergency Federal Funding For NYS Hospitals, Health Systems, And Community Health Centers: The chief architect of the 'Marshall Plan for Healthcare' in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured over $10.7 billion for New York state's hospitals, health systems, and community health centers. New York also received the lion's share of the initial $10 billion designated for 'hot spots' nationally, receiving $4.5 billion. The funding allowed hospitals and health systems across New York state to cover unreimbursed health care related expenses or make up for lost revenues attributable to the public health emergency resulting from COVID-19, especially from cancelled elective procedures, increased staffing and overtime costs, expanded bed capacity, and increased spending on supplies and equipment to meet the surge in COVID-19 patients.
More Than $55 billion In Paycheck Protection Program And Economic Injury Disaster Loan And Grant Funding For New York's Small Businesses And Nonprofits: Senator Schumer, a longtime champion of small businesses and nonprofits across New York, negotiated a small business rescue plan that allocated over $38.6 billion in forgivable loans through close to 349,000 awards to New York's small businesses and nonprofits so they could maintain their existing workforce and help pay for other expenses, including rent, mortgage, or utilities. Self-employed, independent contractors, and sole proprietors were also eligible for assistance. Schumer also fought to ensure nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business relief. Because of Schumer's efforts, a PPP set-aside was created in COVID relief legislation that passed following the CARES Act to provide more assistance to underserved businesses. This $60 billion set-aside was for lending through community lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), Minority Depository Institutions, and microloans to expand access to minority-owned and other underserved small businesses and nonprofits. This included a specific $10 billion CDFI set-aside established by the Treasury Department after Schumer's relentless advocacy. Senator Schumer also fought to create in the CARES Act a new Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) cash advance grant program that provided more than $1.3 billion in grant funding to over 450,000 New York small businesses and nonprofits. More than $17.3 billion in EIDL loan assistance was awarded as well. In addition, Schumer successfully added farms and value-added farm businesses as eligible recipients of EIDL loans and grants to provide New York's agricultural economy a lifeline in this crisis.
Over $3.4 Billion For Economic Development And Public Infrastructure through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): With $1 billion allocated to New York state and over $2.4 billion allocated directly to communities across New York, Senator Schumer secured over $3.4 billion in CDBG funding in the CARES Act that supports local economic growth, community revitalization, and affordable housing. The funding allows New York state and communities to create good-paying jobs, continue delivering essential services, and invest in affordable housing at a time when the COVID crisis had endangered all community services.
Over $4 billion For New York Transit Systems: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured $4,158,708,448 for transit systems across New York State. The funding enabled transit systems to continue operating safely during the pandemic to allow essential workers to commute to their jobs and act as a lifeline for transit riders without a car to continue to access every day essential services.
Over $411 Million For New York Airports: As the COVID-19 crisis immediately impacted the travel industry, Senator Schumer secured $411,274,414.22 in the CARES Act for airports all across New York state. The funding increased the federal share in the Airport Improvement program and other grants already planned for the fiscal year 2020, to 100%. The additional funding and elimination of the local share allowed for critical safety and capacity projects to continue as planned despite the financial impact of the COVID crisis on airports.
Over $15.7 Billion In Direct Cash Payments To Individuals And Families Across the State: The CARES Act provided critical financial support in the form of one-time Economic Impact Payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples below a certain income threshold, as well as an additional $500 payment per dependent child. More than 9.8 million of these direct cash payments were delivered to lower and middle-income New Yorkers this year, helping working families cover their household expenses and weather this unprecedented economic crisis. Senator Schumer also successfully called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reverse its original guidance and streamline these direct payments to Social Security recipients, ensuring that seniors and other vulnerable New Yorkers would not have to take an additional, unnecessary step of filing tax returns in order to receive this assistance.
$1.5 Billion In Testing Funding For New York State: In May, Senator Schumer announced that New York state received $1.5 billion out of a $10.25 billion national pot for coronavirus (COVID-19) testing he proposed and fought to secure as a lead negotiator in the 'Corona 3.5' legislation. Specifically, New York State received $700,248,982 and New York City received $807,512,729 that can be used for COVID-19 testing purposes, including for testing equipment and supplies, contract tracing and surveillance, personal protective equipment and more.
Secured $7 Billion In Loans For New York Hospitals And Providers: In addition to the grant money he secured, Senator Schumer secured roughly $7 billion in loans for New York hospitals and health care providers. This additional cash flow provided a lifeline to those providers as they weathered caring for Covid-19 patients and major revenue losses from shutting down as many of their services as possible. Schumer subsequently re-negotiated the repayment terms for these loans to make them far more favorable to New York providers, ensuring that they had all the resources they needed to combat the pandemic.
Expanded SNAP Benefits, Secured An Additional $162 Million In Funding For Child Care, Continued Nutrition For Seniors, And Delivered Nearly $1 Billion To Help Heat Homes When Income Becomes A Problem
Secured $2.15B For K-12 Schools And Institutions Of Higher Education Across New York: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought and secured $1 billion for K-12 schools through the Education Stabilization Fund, $164 million under the Governor's Emergency Education fund, and over $900 million for institutions of Higher Education. This pandemic relief helped support the education sector as it worked to meet the educational needs of students across the state.
Secured Nation's First Major Disaster Declaration for COVID-19, Unlocking Almost $6 billion In Federal FEMA Support for New York State: Following Schumer's tireless advocacy and early calls for broad federal support from FEMA, New York State was granted the first Major Disaster Declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic of any state in the country. Schumer has continued to push the Administrator and the President to provide all support available to New York under FEMA's control, delivering almost $6 billion for the state thus far, with over $1 billion in reimbursement for COVID-19 costs incurred by the state, localities, and eligible non-profits, like purchasing personal protective equipment and paying health care workers overtime.
Secured Over $6 Billion In FMAP Funds For NYS And Its Counties To Provide Vital Budget And Health Care Relief: Senator Schumer successfully pushed for Congress to include a cost-sharing provision in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act so New York's counties, which pay part of Medicaid's costs, could benefit from the increase federal Medicaid support. Schumer had successfully championed this provision in prior disaster response legislation, including after 9-11, Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 financial meltdown. The legislation immediately unlocked over $6 billion in state-wide dollars related to healthcare funds known as 'FMAP' for New York state and its counties to cover healthcare costs, $1 billion in unemployment benefits, free testing, pair emergency leave, meals for homebound seniors, and other critical services.
Fighting Hunger By Securing Pandemic-EBT Program Extension through September 2021 : After tirelessly advocating for expanded nutrition benefits, Senator Schumer secured numerous nutrition benefits in the negotiations for the Continuing Resolution. The Continuing Resolution extended P-EBT benefits through September 30, 2021 and creates a pathway to allow territories to participate in the P-EBT program. Roughly 2.1 million students across New York State are eligible for the P-EBT program, which provides families with additional nutrition assistance for students when schools are closed or in virtual learning.
Boosted NYS Hemp Growers and Producers To Create Jobs : Senator Schumer called on USDA to delay the implementation of the USDA's U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program final rule and urged USDA to respond to the numerous concerns of hemp growers and producers in Upstate NY. The senator worked closely with the House of Representatives to include language in the Continuing Resolution that extends the authorization for the 2014 hemp pilot program regulations through September 30, 2021, which will give New York hemp farmers additional time to come into compliance with USDA's new regulations for hemp.
Secured Over $409 Million for NYS Farmers : Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Senator Schumer has pushed USDA to expand the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to include as many commodities as possible and ensure New York State farmers receive the assistance they need. Senator Schumer lobbied USDA to include more specialty crops, small livestock, goats, microgreens, nursery and greenhouse commodities, nontraditional crops, and more on the list of eligible crops for CFAP. Following his efforts, USDA expanded the eligibility lists for CFAP 1 and rolled out a second CFAP program, CFAP 2, which included a significantly expanded list of eligible crops. To date, New York farmers have received over $222 million in assistance through the CFAP 1 program and $187 million through CFAP 2.
Secured A Major Disaster Declaration And Disaster Funding After Tropical Storm Isaias And Demanded Answers From Electricity CEOs: After Tropical Storm Isaias ripped through the Hudson Valley, New York City, and Long Island, Senator Schumer personally called the CEOs of Con Edison, Central Hudson, and PSEG to demand answers for why New Yorkers were left without power for days following inadequate communication. Schumer also sent a letter to the President urging him to declare this a major disaster and unlock millions in federal funds for the impacted region. After receiving this letter, the President granted the declaration for the 7 worst hit counties.
Called on TSA to Keep Agency Secure by Eliminating Its Use of TikTok : Citing concerns about communicating with the public via TikTok, Schumer called on the Transit Security Administration to reconsider its use of the platform and consult with the Department of Homeland Security, given laws that compel Chinese companies like partially China-owned TikTok to share data with the Chinese Communist Party. After raising the alarm, TSA discontinued its use of the social media platform.
NYC
Awarding Of Construction Contract On The Jamaica Armory Project After Senator Schumer Secured $91 Million In Funding: A construction contract has been awarded to further make progress on the Jamaica Armory project for both a 41,000 square foot addition to the readiness center and the restoration of the 140,000 square foot facility to support the center's training, administrative, and logistical needs. The modernization of the Jamaica armory will create jobs and act as an anchor to the Southeast Queens community, the National Guard, and all of New York City.
Established PPP Set-Asides For Lending To Underserved Small Businesses And Communities Of Color: After the enactment of the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought to provide more focused relief to the most underserved small businesses, which are often located in communities of color. As part of the subsequent COVID 3.5 bill the ""Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act"" Schumer negotiated a $60 billion PPP set-aside for small and mid-sized community lenders, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and microloan funds. After that bill passed, Schumer sent letters and placed calls to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, calling on him to create an even more narrowly focused set-aside for CDFIs and MDIs. In May, Secretary Mnuchin and the Small Business Administration heeded the calls of Sen. Schumer by announcing they would set aside $10 billion exclusively for PPP lending through CDFIs.
Delivered Billions in Aid To Save Our Subways, Busses and MTA; Delivered Two Financial Lifelines To The MTA As Ridership Levels Plummeted: As ridership levels on the Metropolitan Transit Authority's network of subways, buses, and commuter rails dropped to historic lows due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, Senator Schumer prevailed in the face of Republican intransigence to secure nearly $4 billion to stop the fiscal bleeding at the nation's largest public transit network. These funds stabilized the MTA's finances as it undertook an historic subway car cleaning program and other safety measures to keep the system running through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, Sen. Schumer successfully secured access to the Federal Reserve's Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) for the MTA and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after he appealed directly to Fed Chairman Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. To date, the MTA has tapped the MLF for $450 billion in debt relief.
Delivered Urgent Aid To Parishes, Churches, Schools To Enable Then To Survive The COVID Lockdown: As a result of Schumer's efforts, nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business COVID relief.

Gillibrand's office, FEMA, DHSES, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and New York Police Department that brought together dozens of local churches, synagogues, mosques, parochial schools, and other faith-based community organizations to discuss the application process for NSGP.

Secured Over $3.2M For Economic Development In The Town Of Cortlandt Ahead Of Indian Point's Impending 2021 Closure: Senator Schumer locked in over $3.2 million in federal funds for the Town of Cortlandt to boost economic activity in the Lower Hudson Valley when the Indian Point nuclear power plant shuts down in April 2021. This funding comes from a new program housed by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) that Schumer helped create to assist communities, like those surrounding Indian Point, offset the devastating economic impacts of a closing nuclear power plant.
NORTH COUNTRY
Ensured Funding To Deepen The Port Of Ogdensburg Remained Locked-In Place After Project Delay: In 2017, Senator Schumer secured funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to deepen the Ogdensburg Harbor and create new economic opportunities for the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority (OBPA). However the federal funds were in jeopardy as the project was delayed while OBPA sought additional funds to complete the project. In 2020, Senator Schumer worked with USACE keep the federal funding in place while OBPA successfully secured additional funding. The long-delayed project will finally begin this year and lead to increased commerce at the Port of Ogdensburg.
Secured Over $4 Million For Economic Development Projects Across The Northern Border: Senator Schumer secured $4,499,626 in federal funding for eight projects aimed at improving the economy in Northern New York. The funding was allocated through the Northern Border Regional Commission's (NBRC) Economic and Infrastructure Development Investment Program to support infrastructure projects and other initiatives that create jobs, support infrastructure, and strengthen the economy in the city of Troy Warren, Washington, Sullivan, St. Lawrence, and Herkimer Counties, Tupper Lake, Town of Essex, and North Country Community College.
LONG ISLAND
Delivered Historic $2.6 Billion Federal Investment To Construct World First Electron Ion Collider At Brookhaven National Lab On Long Island: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine that would allow scientists to look inside the building blocks of an atom. In 2018 Senator Schumer, a long time benefactor of BNL, urged the Department of Energy to construct a U.S.-based EIC after a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine published a report urging immediate action to advance fundamental research into nuclear physics as a national security interest. Sen. Schumer spearheaded Congressional commitment to advancing scientific research by using his role as Democratic Leader to ensure that DOE had enough funding to advance the construction of an EIC to the solicitation phase. DOE issued a request for proposals for construction of the EIC triggering a competition between BNL and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Senator Schumer successfully made the case to DOE that BNL's track record in constructing large user facilities of national significance like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) made them the ideal choice for the EIC. In early 2020, DOE announced that it had chosen BNL's proposal and would begin the process of providing funds to BNL beginning the design phase of this $2.6 billion atom smasher.
Steered Course Correction By U.S. Navy To Proactively Clean Up The Toxic Grumman Plume; Secured Navy Commitment To Finally Intercept Ever Expanding Plume After 20 Year Fight: The Navy-Grumman Plume is a 3,000+ acre mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emanating from the former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) and Grumman facilities in Bethpage which specialized in aviation, weapons and space exploration manufacturing from the 1930s to 1998. Schumer long championed the position that the state and the Navy should be working to ""hydraulically contain"" and remove the ever expanding plume from Long Island's sole source aquifer rather than focusing on its practice of ""wellhead treatment"" which addressed the problem on the surface but ignored the swiftly metastasizing chemicals underneath. For twenty years Senator Schumer advanced the ball by pushing the United States Geological Survey and later, the Navy to fully map the plume through federal legislation. With this new data secured by Senator Schumer, state health regulators realized that containment was possible and began working on a plan to contain the plume. At first recalcitrant, after Schumer's urging, the Navy began to work with the state on a plan to try to contain the ever expanding plume. In late 2020, Navy announced that they had developed a plan to intercept migrating plume, Navy would construct extraction wells along the Southern State Parkway to intercept plume before it reaches south shore communities like Massapequa and the Great South Bay.
Landed Department Of Energy National Center For Quantum Information Science At Brookhaven National Lab, Part Of $625 Million Federal Commitment To Quantum Science: Senator Schumer worked tirelessly in Congress to pass The National Quantum Initiative Act which directed the DOE to establish at least three national centers for the purpose of advancing the United States' knowledge in the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS). In 2019, after passage of the act, Schumer worked directly with the DOE Secretary to ensure Congress adequately funded DOE to swiftly establish the National QIS Centers while simultaneously urging him to consider BNL as one of the three sites based off of their achievements in advancing our knowledge of QIS. In early 2020, DOE announced up to $625 million over five years to fund five Quantum Research Centers including the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Labs.
Sounded The Alarm On Vital Equipment Taken Off Fire Island Post-Sandy Project And Moved To Project One-Mile From Mar-A-Lago: Schumer has long-fought for federal funding to shore up costal storm protections for communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy, including the Fire Island and Moriches Inlet project off of Long Island. Part-way through the construction work to replenish beaches this year and protect residents from future storm threats, the vitally needed dredging equipmentone of just a handful off the Atlantic Coastwas pulled off the project to complete another beach dredging project at Midtown Beach in Palm Beach County, Floridaa beach that already has a sea wall and sits just a mile from Mar-A-Lagobefore turtle nesting season. Schumer called for an explanation of the decision and commitment that the dredging ship would return to Long Island on time to complete its New York work. After sounding the alarm and staying on top of the Army Corps in subsequent months, the dredge was returned to Long Island on time to resume its emergency coastal protection work."

While Trump never specified how BLM is ""destroying many Black lives,"" the comment was just the latest against the group most associated with nationwide racial justice protests against anti-Black police brutality and systemic racism.
Trump made a number of other claims about Black Lives Matter without evidence. First, Trump claimed that the national BLM movement's ""first phrase"" was ""Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.""
Though the phrase was uttered during a 2015 protest march held by a BLM group in St. Paul, Minnesota, the group was not affiliated with the national BLM organization. The national BLM organization has never used the phrase, nor have any other BLM groups, and it was never said again by the St. Paul group, according to CNN.
Trump then said, ""The stated goal of BLM organization, people, is to achieve the destruction of the nuclear family, abolish the police, abolish prisons, abolish border security, abolish capitalism, and abolish school choice—that's what their stated goals are.""
None of those things are among the goals stated on the BLM national organization's website. The website's recently deleted ""What We Believe"" page, which is still accessible via archive.org, doesn't contain the words ""abolish,"" ""police,"" ""prisons,"" ""border,"" ""capitalism"" or ""school.""
The site's only mention of ""nuclear family"" was a stated desire to ""disrupt"" single-family structures by ""supporting each other as extended families and 'villages' that collectively care for one another, especially our children.""
Among the goals stated on the ""What We Believe"" page were aims to unite Black communities worldwide in opposition to state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism while creating healing, empathetic communities free from prejudice.
During his Friday speech, Trump also unveiled the Black Economic Empowerment ""Platinum Plan."" The plan's aims include designating the Ku Klux Klan and Antifa as terrorist organizations, establishing lynching as a federal hate crime and other initiatives to boost Black economic success. The plan also would make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, commemorates the arrival of Union General Gordon Granger's in Galveston end of the Civil War. Granger delivered the federal order advising that all slaves were free in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863.
On September 8, Trump suggested that BLM activists are ""anarchists, not protesters"" and referred to them as ""thugs"" via Twitter. On June 30, Trump called a BLM street painting on New York City's Fifth Avenue a ""symbol of hate.""
Newsweek contacted the Trump campaign for comment.

December 14, 2020 New York
This piece originally appeared in The Jerusalem Post.
In the constantly expanding digital universe, purveyors of hate are exploiting the newest communications technologies to threaten Jews.
The deleterious impact of the ""digitization of antisemitism"" was revealed in the 2020 State of Antisemitism in America report recently issued by the American Jewish Committee (AJC).
Twenty-two percent of American Jewish adults have experienced antisemitism online or on social media in the last five years. Of this group, 62% said they had been the targets of antisemitic remarks on Facebook, 33% on Twitter, 12% on Instagram and 10% on YouTube.
The impact of hate Jews are experiencing online mirrors the experience with more traditional forms of antisemitism. While 24% say they avoid wearing, carrying or displaying things that might identify them as Jews, and 31% avoid certain places, events or situations out of concern for their safety, the AJC survey also found that 24% who are active on social media avoid posting content that may identify them as Jewish.
""We all need to send the message that antisemitism in any form is unacceptable on or offline,"" Holly Huffnagle, AJC's US director for combating antisemitism, told the Inter-parliamentary Task Force on Online Antisemitism last month.
Findings in AJC's second annual comprehensive survey of US Jewish perceptions of and experiences with antisemitism in the United States reflect the fast-moving changes in how antisemitism is transmitted.
""Digitization of antisemitism is the farthest-reaching battleground. What happens online doesn't stay online,"" says Huffnagle, recalling that the hate-filled individuals who carried out the murderous assaults at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue and Chabad of Poway posted threatening manifestos shortly before their attacks.
One essential tool to combat antisemitism is keeping law enforcement informed. But 76% of American Jews who have experienced an antisemitic incident do not report it at all, and only 4% tell the police.
This reluctance concerns top law enforcement officials across the country. ""You are going to lose every case you do not charge,"" Ohio Attorney-General Dave Yost said on an AJC Advocacy Anywhere program, in an appeal to ""victims of hate crimes who have declined to report because they feel nothing is going to happen.""
But a perceived lack of responsiveness also may inhibit willingness to report. Nearly half (46%) of American Jews who reported online antisemitism to a social media platform said that nothing was done to address the incident.
The amassing of hate, and specifically antisemitism, online demands attention and action by the leaders of the technology giants. The creators of top social media platforms may have begun with good intentions pioneering global communications, but as some veteran social media executives admitted in the Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, the consequences of people and groups imbued with hate and limitless reach were underestimated or ignored.
""Freedom of speech must never be confused with freedom to incite violence and hatred,"" New York Attorney-General Letitia James said on the AJC program where Yost appeared.
Putting the evil social media genie back in the bottle is an enormous challenge. Facebook, for one, has taken steps to ban certain antisemitic stereotypes as well as Holocaust denial and distortion. It's a methodical process, relying heavily on human moderators, who can follow-up on what the algorithms are missing.
""Facebook has two billion users worldwide, but 90% of them do not live in the United States and Canada,"" Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, explained on a recent AJC Advocacy Anywhere program. Training moderators to identify what constitutes antisemitic posts is imperative.
But users also need to learn what is antisemitic, and whether they are engaging in it online or offline. AJC's survey of the general American population, also part of the State of Antisemitism in America report, found that only 53% of Americans are familiar with the term ""antisemitism."" Another 25% acknowledged that they do not know what the word means even though they said they have heard it, and 21% said they had never heard the term ""antisemitism.""
The correlation between awareness and education level is pronounced. Thirty-six percent of those with a high school diploma or less, 14% with some college, and 9% with a college degree were among the 21% who are totally unaware of the term antisemitism.
While 82% of American Jews said antisemitism in the US has increased over the past five years, 47% of the general population who have completed at least some college agreed, compared with 36% of those with less education.
In the US, the adage ""what begins with Jews doesn't end with Jews,"" is not resonating throughout American society, even though some elected officials, religious and ethnic leaders have recognized and declared that antisemitism is a problem for all to address.
Ignorance is a significant obstacle to developing and implementing concrete actions aimed at containing and pushing back the proliferation of antisemitism. Those involved in the business of education, including social media firms, should lead in making the battle against antisemitism a national priority.

President Trump signed in executive order[1] in June vowing criminal prosecution for anyone who damages a monument or memorial, including religious property.The incidents could be considered a hate crime, Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami said. He said he's not surprised to see a wave of attacks on places of worship.'When we see acts of vandalism around the country, those acts of vandalism can result in more acts of vandalism,' Wenski said.'Just as our Jewish brothers and sisters are always very concerned about any incident of anti-Semitism, even if it instigated by someone who is mentally unbalanced, they immediately become very vigilant,' he said. 
'Catholics, we have to be vigilant also.'More than a dozen churches across the U.S. has been vandalized in recent weeks, including a Florida church set ablaze by a man who crashed his vehicle into the building.

He'd gotten inside the narthex, put ten gallons of gasoline on the floor, set it on fire and came out. And I was face to face with him like this. And he jumped into his car and off he sped,' the Rev. Patrick O'Doherty said in a video[2] shared on the Queen of Peace Catholic Church's website.Police arrested 24-year-old Steven Anthony Shields[3] and charged him with attempted murder and arson, among other charges.

An antiabortion memorial[6] was damaged in New York. Virgin Mary statues in Colorado[7], Massachusetts[8] and Tennessee[9] were desecrated. The doors of a church in Connecticut were painted with 'anarchist and satanic symbols,' the Archdiocese of Hartford said in a Facebook post[10]. A crucifix[11] in Illinois was also vandalized in early July.Other places of worship were vandalized during the protests following George Floyd's death, including St. John's Episcopal Church near the White House and St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.Members of Murph-Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a predominately black church in North Highlands, California, found racial slurs and threats of violence carved into an air conditioning unit.'Everything started with George Floyd, and then of course it spun out of control,' Catholic League President Bill Donahue said, pointing to the police killing of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis and the ensuing calls for the removals of statues that are seen as racially insensitive as a possible motive.'It's all driven by hatred. Every last bit of it is driven by hatred,' Donahue said.In California, several statues of St. Junipero Serra, an 18th century Spanish missionary, were removed by protesters or local authorities[12] amid a reexamination of the missionary's treatment of indigenous people. Pope Francis canonized St. Junipero during a visit to the U.S. in 2015.'There is no question that California's indigenous people endured great suffering during the colonial period and then later faced the horror of government-sanctioned genocide under the nascent State of California. This legacy is heartbreaking. Yet, it is also true that while Fr. Serra worked under this colonial system, he denounced its evils and worked to protect the dignity of native peoples. His holiness as a missionary should not be measured by his own failures to stop the exploitation or even his own personal faults,'Bishop Jaime Soto, of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Sacramento, said in a July 5 statement[13].It's not always those who have been critical of places of worship who are accused of desecrating them. Sometimes it's an inside job.An organist at St. David's Episcopal Church in Indiana was arrested after an anti-gay slur, swastika and 'Heil Trump' was graffitied on the exterior of the building after Trump's election.A member of Hopewell Missionary Baptist in Mississippi was charged with setting fire to the church before Election Day in 2016.The issue is not exclusive to the U.S. It's happening in Europe, too.France recorded 1,052 incidents in 2019 it described as anti-Christian.

‘Seinfeld’
There are holiday episodes, and then there are episodes that invent new holidays. “The Strike” introduced Festivus, the now-legendary annual protest by Frank Costanza (Jerry Stiller) against the commercialization of Christmas. Instead of decorating a tree, revelers gather around an aluminum pole and compete in “Feats of Strength.” The greatest Festivus tradition of all is the “Airing of Grievances,” which culminates in a hilariously uncomfortable holiday dinner.
‘Community’
From the mind of creator Dan Harmon, “Community”’s experimental holiday special “Abed’s Uncontrollable Christmas” is an animated tribute to kitschy 1960s stop-motion holiday specials like “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” But it’s also a glimpse into the one-of-a-kind brain of Greendale Community College’s resident pop-culture obsessive, Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi). In the episode, some mysterious trauma has mentally transported him to a snow-covered fantasy planet, where he embarks on a journey to uncover the true meaning of Christmas. As that’s happening, it’s up to his study-group comrades to bring him back to live-action reality.
‘The West Wing’
Many shows brighten up their story lines for the holidays, but Aaron Sorkin’s political drama went darker with “In Excelsis Deo,” a Season 1 highlight whose Emmy-winning script showcases White House staffers’ responses to tragedy. As Toby (Richard Schiff) hustles to arrange a proper burial for a homeless veteran whose body is found in the capitol, C.J. (Allison Janney) crusades for hate-crime legislation in a side plot inspired by the real-life murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student.
‘Friends’
Santa Claus, Superman and a guy dressed as an armadillo walk into a suspiciously spacious New York apartment. What sounds like the setup for an awful joke is actually the uproarious culmination of frantic efforts by Ross (David Schwimmer) to convince his half-Jewish son that Hanukkah is just as fun as Christmas. Animal costumes aside, “The One With the Holiday Armadillo” is a humorous treatment of a very real parenting predicament that makes it a classic.
‘Futurama’
Pine trees may have gone extinct centuries ago, but Christmas (well, “Xmas”) still exists in the 31st-century world of Matt Groening’s animated sci-fi comedy. Unfortunately, the holiday also activates a malevolent robot Santa programmed to kill everyone it deems naughty. With a subplot that has the hapless hero Fry hoping to woo his eternal crush, Leela, with the perfect gift, “Xmas Story” offers action, romance and plentiful laughs — ideal viewing for an all-ages crowd.
‘Cheers’
Rebecca (Kirstie Alley) becomes the Grinch who stole Christmas Eve in “Christmas Cheer,” a cozy episode from her first season on “Cheers.” The episode begins when she enrages Sam (Ted Danson) by scheduling him to work on the night before Christmas; of course, the evening becomes a bonding experience for the staff and the regulars as a crew of tipsy Santas invades the bar. Things really start looking up for Sam when he encounters an angel in the form of a pretty flight attendant (Jayne Modean), who has a fondness for fancy lingerie.
‘The O.C.’
There’s no lack of soapy intrigue in “The Best Christmukkah Ever,” the first holiday special of this quintessentially mid-2000s teen drama, which features a love triangle, an arrest and an interfamilial legal dispute. But it also kicked off the show’s sweet annual tradition of episodes that find the interfaith Cohen family celebrating “Chrismukkah.” As explained by its teenage mastermind, Seth (Adam Brody), the holiday mashup’s highlight is “eight days of presents followed by one day of many presents.” No wonder it entered the cultural lexicon so quickly.
‘Everybody Hates Chris’
In “Everybody Hates Kwanzaa,” Chris’s father (Terry Crews) trades Christmas for Kwanzaa, but it’s not because he wants to celebrate African-American culture — it’s because he’s too cheap to spend money on presents for his family. This premise allows the show to educate viewers about a widely misunderstood holiday without watering down creator Chris Rock’s biting humor, in an episode that also teaches young Chris (Tyler James Williams) an unexpected lesson about charity.
‘The Office’
NBC’s “The Office” aired many memorable holiday episodes, but nothing tops Part 2 of the original British version’s “Christmas Special,” which is also the series finale. In the episode, Ricky Gervais’s career-making workplace comedy culminates at that most awkward of professional occasions: the company Christmas party, where alcohol loosens inhibitions and colleagues finally tell each other how they really feel. Despite its being Part 2, the episode works as a stand-alone — although its romantic climax is more satisfying if you’ve already watched the first and second seasons.
‘Fresh Off the Boat’
In “The Real Santa,” Jessica, the Huang family matriarch (Constance Wu), reinvents Santa Claus to make him more relevant to her kids. Instead of a white toymaker, Santa becomes a Chinese math-and-science whiz who calls his mom daily. And then he transforms into, well, Jessica herself, in a scene that’s both laugh-out-loud funny and a heartwarming example of how America’s most beloved traditions can evolve to suit all kinds of families.

Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) News Release",FALSE,"Even a year as tumultuous as 2020, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Senate Democratic Leader, today completed his 22nd consecutive tour of all 62 New York State counties--an accomplishment that continues his track record as the first New York State public official to visit every single county in New York each year he has been in office.
Over the course of the year, Schumer made 86 county visits to Upstate New York and Long Island. He visited counties in the Capital Region 15 times; Western New York 6 times; Central New York 8 times; the Rochester-Finger Lakes 12 times; the Southern Tier 10 times; the Hudson Valley 14 times; the North Country 8 times; and Long Island 13 times.
""22 years ago, upon my election to the United States Senate in 1998, I promised that each and every year I served, I would visit all 62 of New York State's diverse counties. Not only has this ritual remained a steadfast passion of mine because of all I learn from my constituents and bring to Washington, D.C. as both a senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate,"" said Senator Schumer. ""Especially this year, when New York battled the global health and economic pandemic especially hard, visiting all 62 counties was vital for me to learn firsthand the struggles and needs of New Yorkers, from one end of the state to the other. Through a year that much has changed - I, too, traveled with masks and disinfectant in tow to much smaller and more understated events - one thing remained the same: my commitment, dedication, and love for New York. This year, more than ever before, I learned more about the struggles and needs of New York and saw New Yorkers resilience, perseverance, and grit and time and time again the very best New York has to offer even during our darkest of days.""
Schumer added, ""Although I've gained the title of Senate Democratic Leader, my proudest and most principal titles have been, and will always remain, New York's Senator and 'New Yorker.' At the close of twenty-two years, my beliefs are as clear as ever: 'Senators who stay in Washington and never return home are simply not doing their job.' Although this year looked a little different with online or-socially distanced events and celebrations, that's why I safely go to all of the places that I can. Whether I'm celebrating a virtual high school graduation or fighting for our first responders all over the state, I'm always learning more about New York directly from my constituents.""
Some of the key highlights include:
New York State
Delivered $167 Billion For New York In COVID Relief: During negotiations for the CARES Act, Schumer worked for days to deliver a plan that best protected New York's workers, small businesses, and health centers so they could receive the help they needed amidst the COVID crisis. The CARES Act Included:
* Over $37 billion In Federal Funding For 'Unemployment Insurance On Steroids' Relief For New Yorkers: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer successfully fought for and secured a historic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance (UI). Importantly, economists have credited the UI expansion with mitigating a larger increase in poverty. The Senator conceived this plan with an understanding of how the modern New York economy functions, expanding unemployment benefits to more than 1.8 million freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors, and other workers in non-traditional employment across New York State since the start of the pandemic. The extended and expanded UI programs in the CARES Act also increased the maximum unemployment benefit amount by $600 per week above one's base unemployment compensation benefit for four months and ensured that workers who were laid-off or out of work through no fault of their own, on average, received their full pay for a full quarter. Additionally, Senator Schumer secured 100% federal financing of benefits paid through existing state Shared Work programs, allowing thousands of New York employers to avoid layoffs during the downturn by connecting their employees who are working reduced hours with partial UI compensation.
* $10.7 Billion In Emergency Federal Funding For NYS Hospitals, Health Systems, And Community Health Centers: The chief architect of the 'Marshall Plan for Healthcare' in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured over $10.7 billion for New York state's hospitals, health systems, and community health centers. New York also received the lion's share of the initial $10 billion designated for 'hot spots' nationally, receiving $4.5 billion. The funding allowed hospitals and health systems across New York state to cover unreimbursed health care related expenses or make up for lost revenues attributable to the public health emergency resulting from COVID-19, especially from cancelled elective procedures, increased staffing and overtime costs, expanded bed capacity, and increased spending on supplies and equipment to meet the surge in COVID-19 patients.
* More Than $55 billion In Paycheck Protection Program And Economic Injury Disaster Loan And Grant Funding For New York's Small Businesses And Nonprofits: Senator Schumer, a longtime champion of small businesses and nonprofits across New York, negotiated a small business rescue plan that allocated over $38.6 billion in forgivable loans through close to 349,000 awards to New York's small businesses and nonprofits so they could maintain their existing workforce and help pay for other expenses, including rent, mortgage, or utilities. Self-employed, independent contractors, and sole proprietors were also eligible for assistance. Schumer also fought to ensure nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business relief. Because of Schumer's efforts, a PPP set-aside was created in COVID relief legislation that passed following the CARES Act to provide more assistance to underserved businesses. This $60 billion set-aside was for lending through community lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), Minority Depository Institutions, and microloans to expand access to minority-owned and other underserved small businesses and nonprofits. This included a specific $10 billion CDFI set-aside established by the Treasury Department after Schumer's relentless advocacy. Senator Schumer also fought to create in the CARES Act a new Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) cash advance grant program that provided more than $1.3 billion in grant funding to over 450,000 New York small businesses and nonprofits. More than $17.3 billion in EIDL loan assistance was awarded as well. In addition, Schumer successfully added farms and value-added farm businesses as eligible recipients of EIDL loans and grants to provide New York's agricultural economy a lifeline in this crisis.
* Over $3.4 Billion For Economic Development And Public Infrastructure through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): With $1 billion allocated to New York state and over $2.4 billion allocated directly to communities across New York, Senator Schumer secured over $3.4 billion in CDBG funding in the CARES Act that supports local economic growth, community revitalization, and affordable housing. The funding allows New York state and communities to create good-paying jobs, continue delivering essential services, and invest in affordable housing at a time when the COVID crisis had endangered all community services.
* Over $4 billion For New York Transit Systems: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured $4,158,708,448 for transit systems across New York State. The funding enabled transit systems to continue operating safely during the pandemic to allow essential workers to commute to their jobs and act as a lifeline for transit riders without a car to continue to access every day essential services.
* Over $411 Million For New York Airports: As the COVID-19 crisis immediately impacted the travel industry, Senator Schumer secured $411,274,414.22 in the CARES Act for airports all across New York state. The funding increased the federal share in the Airport Improvement program and other grants already planned for the fiscal year 2020, to 100%. The additional funding and elimination of the local share allowed for critical safety and capacity projects to continue as planned despite the financial impact of the COVID crisis on airports.
* Over $15.7 Billion In Direct Cash Payments To Individuals And Families Across the State: The CARES Act provided critical financial support in the form of one-time Economic Impact Payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples below a certain income threshold, as well as an additional $500 payment per dependent child. More than 9.8 million of these direct cash payments were delivered to lower and middle-income New Yorkers this year, helping working families cover their household expenses and weather this unprecedented economic crisis. Senator Schumer also successfully called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reverse its original guidance and streamline these direct payments to Social Security recipients, ensuring that seniors and other vulnerable New Yorkers would not have to take an additional, unnecessary step of filing tax returns in order to receive this assistance.
* $1.5 Billion In Testing Funding For New York State: In May, Senator Schumer announced that New York state received $1.5 billion out of a $10.25 billion national pot for coronavirus (COVID-19) testing he proposed and fought to secure as a lead negotiator in the 'Corona 3.5' legislation. Specifically, New York State received $700,248,982 and New York City received $807,512,729 that can be used for COVID-19 testing purposes, including for testing equipment and supplies, contract tracing and surveillance, personal protective equipment and more.
* Secured $7 Billion In Loans For New York Hospitals And Providers: In addition to the grant money he secured, Senator Schumer secured roughly $7 billion in loans for New York hospitals and health care providers. This additional cash flow provided a lifeline to those providers as they weathered caring for Covid-19 patients and major revenue losses from shutting down as many of their services as possible. Schumer subsequently re-negotiated the repayment terms for these loans to make them far more favorable to New York providers, ensuring that they had all the resources they needed to combat the pandemic.
* Expanded SNAP Benefits, Secured An Additional $162 Million In Funding For Child Care, Continued Nutrition For Seniors, And Delivered Nearly $1 Billion To Help Heat Homes When Income Becomes A Problem
* Secured $2.15B For K-12 Schools And Institutions Of Higher Education Across New York: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought and secured $1 billion for K-12 schools through the Education Stabilization Fund, $164 million under the Governor's Emergency Education fund, and over $900 million for institutions of Higher Education. This pandemic relief helped support the education sector as it worked to meet the educational needs of students across the state.
* Secured Nation's First Major Disaster Declaration for COVID-19, Unlocking Almost $6 billion In Federal FEMA Support for New York State: Following Schumer's tireless advocacy and early calls for broad federal support from FEMA, New York State was granted the first Major Disaster Declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic of any state in the country. Schumer has continued to push the Administrator and the President to provide all support available to New York under FEMA's control, delivering almost $6 billion for the state thus far, with over $1 billion in reimbursement for COVID-19 costs incurred by the state, localities, and eligible non-profits, like purchasing personal protective equipment and paying health care workers overtime.
Secured Over $6 Billion In FMAP Funds For NYS And Its Counties To Provide Vital Budget And Health Care Relief: Senator Schumer successfully pushed for Congress to include a cost-sharing provision in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act so New York's counties, which pay part of Medicaid's costs, could benefit from the increase federal Medicaid support. Schumer had successfully championed this provision in prior disaster response legislation, including after 9-11, Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 financial meltdown. The legislation immediately unlocked over $6 billion in state-wide dollars related to healthcare funds known as 'FMAP' for New York state and its counties to cover healthcare costs, $1 billion in unemployment benefits, free testing, pair emergency leave, meals for homebound seniors, and other critical services.
Fighting Hunger By Securing Pandemic-EBT Program Extension through September 2021: After tirelessly advocating for expanded nutrition benefits, Senator Schumer secured numerous nutrition benefits in the negotiations for the Continuing Resolution. The Continuing Resolution extended P-EBT benefits through September 30, 2021 and creates a pathway to allow territories to participate in the P-EBT program. Roughly 2.1 million students across New York State are eligible for the P-EBT program, which provides families with additional nutrition assistance for students when schools are closed or in virtual learning.
Boosted NYS Hemp Growers and Producers To Create Jobs: Senator Schumer called on USDA to delay the implementation of the USDA's U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program final rule and urged USDA to respond to the numerous concerns of hemp growers and producers in Upstate NY. The senator worked closely with the House of Representatives to include language in the Continuing Resolution that extends the authorization for the 2014 hemp pilot program regulations through September 30, 2021, which will give New York hemp farmers additional time to come into compliance with USDA's new regulations for hemp.
Secured Over $409 Million for NYS Farmers: Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Senator Schumer has pushed USDA to expand the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to include as many commodities as possible and ensure New York State farmers receive the assistance they need. Senator Schumer lobbied USDA to include more specialty crops, small livestock, goats, microgreens, nursery and greenhouse commodities, nontraditional crops, and more on the list of eligible crops for CFAP. Following his efforts, USDA expanded the eligibility lists for CFAP 1 and rolled out a second CFAP program, CFAP 2, which included a significantly expanded list of eligible crops. To date, New York farmers have received over $222 million in assistance through the CFAP 1 program and $187 million through CFAP 2.
Secured A Major Disaster Declaration And Disaster Funding After Tropical Storm Isaias And Demanded Answers From Electricity CEOs: After Tropical Storm Isaias ripped through the Hudson Valley, New York City, and Long Island, Senator Schumer personally called the CEOs of Con Edison, Central Hudson, and PSEG to demand answers for why New Yorkers were left without power for days following inadequate communication. Schumer also sent a letter to the President urging him to declare this a major disaster and unlock millions in federal funds for the impacted region. After receiving this letter, the President granted the declaration for the 7 worst hit counties.
Called on TSA to Keep Agency Secure by Eliminating Its Use of TikTok: Citing concerns about communicating with the public via TikTok, Schumer called on the Transit Security Administration to reconsider its use of the platform and consult with the Department of Homeland Security, given laws that compel Chinese companies like partially China-owned TikTok to share data with the Chinese Communist Party. After raising the alarm, TSA discontinued its use of the social media platform.
NYC
Awarding Of Construction Contract On The Jamaica Armory Project After Senator Schumer Secured $91 Million In Funding: A construction contract has been awarded to further make progress on the Jamaica Armory project for both a 41,000 square foot addition to the readiness center and the restoration of the 140,000 square foot facility to support the center's training, administrative, and logistical needs. The modernization of the Jamaica armory will create jobs and act as an anchor to the Southeast Queens community, the National Guard, and all of New York City.
Established PPP Set-Asides For Lending To Underserved Small Businesses And Communities Of Color: After the enactment of the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought to provide more focused relief to the most underserved small businesses, which are often located in communities of color. As part of the subsequent COVID 3.5 bill - the ""Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act"" - Schumer negotiated a $60 billion PPP set-aside for small and mid-sized community lenders, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and microloan funds. After that bill passed, Schumer sent letters and placed calls to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, calling on him to create an even more narrowly focused set-aside for CDFIs and MDIs. In May, Secretary Mnuchin and the Small Business Administration heeded the calls of Sen. Schumer by announcing they would set aside $10 billion exclusively for PPP lending through CDFIs.
Delivered Billions in Aid To Save Our Subways, Busses and MTA; Delivered Two Financial Lifelines To The MTA As Ridership Levels Plummeted: As ridership levels on the Metropolitan Transit Authority's network of subways, buses, and commuter rails dropped to historic lows due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, Senator Schumer prevailed in the face of Republican intransigence to secure nearly $4 billion to stop the fiscal bleeding at the nation's largest public transit network. These funds stabilized the MTA's finances as it undertook an historic subway car cleaning program and other safety measures to keep the system running through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, Sen. Schumer successfully secured access to the Federal Reserve's Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) for the MTA and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after he appealed directly to Fed Chairman Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. To date, the MTA has tapped the MLF for $450 billion in debt relief.
Delivered Urgent Aid To Parishes, Churches, Schools To Enable Then To Survive The COVID Lockdown: As a result of Schumer's efforts, nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business COVID relief. This relief enabled parishes, schools, churches, synagogues and more to remain solvent and survive the COVID lockdown.
Hosted Workshop With Local Faith-Based Community Organizations To Broaden Access To Nonprofit Security Funding Amid Troubling Increase In Hate Crimes, Leading To Largest Number of Grants Ever Awarded to NYC Area In Program History: Following his successful push for an historic 50 percent increase - $30 million - in Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) funding at the end of last year, Senator Schumer sent a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) calling for a series of workshops and webinars to assist New York-based religious institutions applying to strengthen their security preparedness against religiously motivated attacks like in Monsey. In February, Sen. Schumer's office co-hosted a workshop in Manhattan with Sen. Gillibrand's office, FEMA, DHSES, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and New York Police Department that brought together dozens of local churches, synagogues, mosques, parochial schools, and other faith-based community organizations to discuss the application process for NSGP. In July, DHS announced over $12 million in nonprofit security grants for 138 NYC area organizations, the greatest funding amount nationwide and the largest number of grants ever awarded to the NYC area in program history.

Troy Seawall Stabilization And Riverfront Park North Projects Completed: In September, Sen. Schumer joined Troy Mayor Patrick Madden in cutting the ribbon on this important project. The Seawall was compromised by the flooding during Tropical Storm Irene, leaving the fledgling downtown and key infrastructure vulnerable to a catastrophic flood.

The Stabilization project has also enabled the creation of the beautiful Riverfront Park North and the new Troy Dock and Marina.
CDTA Launches ""Blue Line"" Bus Rapid Transit: On November 19, CDTA officially launched the new Blue Line BRT service linking Albany, Watervliet, Cohoes, Troy and Waterford. This was the culmination of a seven year effort by Sen. Schumer to help CDTA expand BRT service (Schumer press conference at The College of St. Rose on 10/21/13). Schumer was successful in getting CDTA added to the Federal Transit Authority's ""New Starts"" program in late 2016. CDTA received approximately $28m in New Starts funding to create the Blue Line.
Called On Department Of Defense To Stop Incineration Of PFAS At Norlite: Upon hearing that the Norlite facility in Cohoes, NY was incinerating PFAS, Senator Schumer called on the Department of Defense to stop the incineration of these forever chemicals so close to a housing project and the Hudson River.

Harmful Algal Blooms can be toxic to pets and humans and limit the number of recreation days for residents and visitors to enjoy--thereby also limiting tourism spending, a key component in the local economy. The Corps heeded his call and in late August 2020, they successfully launched a pilot program to begin testing and research at Lake Chautauqua. Schumer continues to push for renewed HABs funding in the FY21 appropriations omnibus so that the Lake Chautauqua pilot can be taken to full-scale in the coming years.
Secured $16 Million For CUBRC To Construct A State-Of-The-Art Long-Duration Testing Facility: The funding will continue to boost the Western New York economy and will support the state-of-the-art complex to continue to compete with international competitors like Russia and China in performing hypervelocity weapons systems tests.

Senator had long pushed to ensure a full and fair Army procurement process for the Manpack radio to ensure that companies like L3Harris would have an even playing field to compete.
SOUTHERN TIER
Saved Minor League Baseball And Secured Class AA Affiliation For Rumble Ponies In Binghamton: Senator Schumer fought tooth and nail to preserve the Binghamton Rumble Ponies. After working for over a year to save the team, the senator announced earlier this month that the Mets had chosen to continue their affiliation with the Rumble Ponies and that the team would remain a Class AA affiliate. Last November, after hearing that MLB proposed plans to form a new league that would mean the reassignment of four teams across New York state, including the Rumble Ponies, Schumer sprang into action to keep baseball in Binghamton, writing to MLB to express his concerns about the proposal and urging the league sit down with local stakeholders to work out a plan that would maintain minor league baseball's strong presence in Upstate New York. Last December, the senator personally met with MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred in New York City to once again urge him to keep the Rumble Ponies in Binghamton. Additionally, in February of this year, Schumer invited MLB and Mets top brass to tour NYSEG Stadium with him and hear directly from stakeholders themselves.

Roosevelt, and Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Sites, which comprises over 1,000 acres of historic land that had accumulated over $30.4 million of deferred maintenance over the years. This past August, Schumer stepped in and secured the $30.4 million federal investment needed to properly upkeep Dutchess County's iconic national historic sites which are key to tourism, acting as an economic engine for Hyde Park and its surrounding area.
Successfully Passed The National Purple Heart Honor Mission Commemorative Coin Act In U.S. Senate To Benefit Orange County's National Purple Heart Honor Mission: Senator Schumer introduced the bipartisan National Purple Heart Honor Mission Commemorative Coin Act last Veteran's Day, and this November announced its Senate passage. The legislation will require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and 50[cent] clad coins in 2022, commemorating our nation's Purple Heart recipients. All proceeds from the sale of the coins will contribute to the Orange County-based National Purple Heart Honor Mission, located in New Windsor, New York.
Secured Over $3.2M For Economic Development In The Town Of Cortlandt Ahead Of Indian Point's Impending 2021 Closure: Senator Schumer locked in over $3.2 million in federal funds for the Town of Cortlandt to boost economic activity in the Lower Hudson Valley when the Indian Point nuclear power plant shuts down in April 2021. This funding comes from a new program housed by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) that Schumer helped create to assist communities, like those surrounding Indian Point, offset the devastating economic impacts of a closing nuclear power plant.
NORTH COUNTRY
Secured $9 Million In DoD Funding For Watertown YMCA Community Center, Boosting Downtown Watertown, Fort Drum, And Regional Economy: After continued engagement with the DoD and a personal call with former Defense Secretary Esper, Senator Schumer successfully secured a $9 Million DoD grant to support the Watertown YMCA community center. The funding enables a project that will provide year-round community space for Fort Drum's military families in addition to bolstering downtown Watertown. The completed community center will have a six-lane lap pool, a separate full-size recreational pool, three exercise rooms, and arts/multipurpose room, two indoor tennis courts, and a community kitchen.
Ensured Funding To Deepen The Port Of Ogdensburg Remained Locked-In Place After Project Delay: In 2017, Senator Schumer secured funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to deepen the Ogdensburg Harbor and create new economic opportunities for the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority (OBPA). However the federal funds were in jeopardy as the project was delayed while OBPA sought additional funds to complete the project. In 2020, Senator Schumer worked with USACE keep the federal funding in place while OBPA successfully secured additional funding. The long-delayed project will finally begin this year and lead to increased commerce at the Port of Ogdensburg.
Secured Over $4 Million For Economic Development Projects Across The Northern Border: Senator Schumer secured $4,499,626 in federal funding for eight projects aimed at improving the economy in Northern New York. The funding was allocated through the Northern Border Regional Commission's (NBRC) Economic and Infrastructure Development Investment Program to support infrastructure projects and other initiatives that create jobs, support infrastructure, and strengthen the economy in the city of Troy Warren, Washington, Sullivan, St. Lawrence, and Herkimer Counties, Tupper Lake, Town of Essex, and North Country Community College.
LONG ISLAND
Delivered Historic $2.6 Billion Federal Investment To Construct World First Electron Ion Collider At Brookhaven National Lab On Long Island: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine that would allow scientists to look inside the building blocks of an atom. In 2018 Senator Schumer, a long time benefactor of BNL, urged the Department of Energy to construct a U.S.-based EIC after a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine published a report urging immediate action to advance fundamental research into nuclear physics as a national security interest. Sen. Schumer spearheaded Congressional commitment to advancing scientific research by using his role as Democratic Leader to ensure that DOE had enough funding to advance the construction of an EIC to the solicitation phase. DOE issued a request for proposals for construction of the EIC triggering a competition between BNL and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Senator Schumer successfully made the case to DOE that BNL's track record in constructing large user facilities of national significance like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) made them the ideal choice for the EIC. In early 2020, DOE announced that it had chosen BNL's proposal and would begin the process of providing funds to BNL beginning the design phase of this $2.6 billion atom smasher.
Steered Course Correction By U.S. Navy To Proactively Clean Up The Toxic Grumman Plume; Secured Navy Commitment To Finally Intercept Ever Expanding Plume After 20 Year Fight: The Navy-Grumman Plume is a 3,000+ acre mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emanating from the former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) and Grumman facilities in Bethpage which specialized in aviation, weapons and space exploration manufacturing from the 1930s to 1998. Schumer long championed the position that the state and the Navy should be working to ""hydraulically contain"" and remove the ever expanding plume from Long Island's sole source aquifer rather than focusing on its practice of ""wellhead treatment"" which addressed the problem on the surface but ignored the swiftly metastasizing chemicals underneath. For twenty years Senator Schumer advanced the ball by pushing the United States Geological Survey and later, the Navy to fully map the plume through federal legislation. With this new data secured by Senator Schumer, state health regulators realized that containment was possible and began working on a plan to contain the plume. At first recalcitrant, after Schumer's urging, the Navy began to work with the state on a plan to try to contain the ever expanding plume. In late 2020, Navy announced that they had developed a plan to intercept migrating plume, Navy would construct extraction wells along the Southern State Parkway to intercept plume before it reaches south shore communities like Massapequa and the Great South Bay.
Landed Department Of Energy National Center For Quantum Information Science At Brookhaven National Lab, Part Of $625 Million Federal Commitment To Quantum Science: Senator Schumer worked tirelessly in Congress to pass The National Quantum Initiative Act which directed the DOE to establish at least three national centers for the purpose of advancing the United States' knowledge in the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS). In 2019, after passage of the act, Schumer worked directly with the DOE Secretary to ensure Congress adequately funded DOE to swiftly establish the National QIS Centers while simultaneously urging him to consider BNL as one of the three sites based off of their achievements in advancing our knowledge of QIS. In early 2020, DOE announced up to $625 million over five years to fund five Quantum Research Centers including the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Labs.
Sounded The Alarm On Vital Equipment Taken Off Fire Island Post-Sandy Project And Moved To Project One-Mile From Mar-A-Lago: Schumer has long-fought for federal funding to shore up costal storm protections for communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy, including the Fire Island and Moriches Inlet project off of Long Island. Part-way through the construction work to replenish beaches this year and protect residents from future storm threats, the vitally needed dredging equipment--one of just a handful off the Atlantic Coast--was pulled off the project to complete another beach dredging project at Midtown Beach in Palm Beach County, Florida--a beach that already has a sea wall and sits just a mile from Mar-A-Lago--before turtle nesting season. Schumer called for an explanation of the decision and commitment that the dredging ship would return to Long Island on time to complete its New York work. After sounding the alarm and staying on top of the Army Corps in subsequent months, the dredge was returned to Long Island on time to resume its emergency coastal protection work.

""June is Pride Month where we celebrate inclusion and equality. During this time, we reaffirm our commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, celebrate the progress that has been achieved, and reflect on the work that must still be done. Pride Month has a history born of activism. What began as a fight for life and liberty resulted in a month-long celebration of authenticity.
Pride Month allows people to bravely embrace their identities that have for too long been marginalized, attacked, and disgraced. Because this marginalization continues today, last month, I introduced the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act (H.R.6721) which seeks to combat coronavirus-related threats and attacks, including those against the LGBTQ+ community. I also strongly supported and voted for provisions in the recent House-passed Heroes Act that would strengthen LGBTQ+ non-discrimination protections, including measures directed toward LGBTQ+ youth.
While the Trump administration has continued its assault on LGBTQ+ individuals in the areas of health care and civil rights, the Supreme Court recently upheld protections for LGBTQ+ workers by ruling that employees cannot be fired for their gender identity or sexual orientation. Everyone has the right to live and love freely without fear of discrimination or harassment.
As a Vice Chair of the LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I will always be a proud ally to the LGBTQ+ community, and I'm honored to wish a happy Pride Month to all who celebrate.""

This meant Mayor Bill de Blasio had to carefully threat the needle in commanding a hiatus of good times due to the threat of COVID-19. After all, the protests must go on[1]. Mayor Bill de Blasio hasbanned large gatherings in the city[2]until the end of September, saying, 'We just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.' But he's makingone big exception[3]: Black Lives Matter protests. 'This is a particular moment in American history where 400 years of oppression, 400 years of racism are being addressed in a very, very powerful way that can't compare to anything else,' he says, 'and people's voices needed to be heard.'As much as the passionate will explain, emphatically if not with physical violence, the critical importance of their right to protest, you can't do this. 
De Blasio can't favor one viewpoint over others, no matter how passionately you believe, which is among the many reasons why progressives would like to reimagine the First Amendment to protect only speech and ideas they approve. After all, they're the protectors of justice and decency, and they'll burn you down if you question their righteousness. But when Bill came up with the brilliant idea to paint 'Black Lives Matter' on Fifth Avenue[4] in front of Trump Tower (Hah! Take that, Darth Cheeto!!!), he opened up the public avenues to private expression. Bet he never thought that could happen. When a white couple in Martinez, California, painted over a 'Black Live Matter' mural (why it's called a mural is unclear), they were arrested for a hate crime[5].In Vancouver, BC, a car left a tread mark on a 'pride' rainbow painted on the road over which cars traveled. You'll never guess what happened then[6]. In the minds of many, Black Lives Matter is distinct from all other political causes. There is a fair argument to be made that America's 'original sin' of slavery distinguishes the political message of BLM from all others, making it sui generis and worthy, if not mandatory, of expression on public thoroughfares where it would not be for any other political message. But the Constitution doesn't work that way[7]. https://blog.simplejustice.us/2020/07/12/painting-the-road-to-hell/womenfirst/ Smartly done, eliminating any objection for size, color, font or location. The only difference is the content of the message. As the First Amendment prohibits the government from favoring one message over another, requiring it to be content neutral, And the message itself is positive, and clearly inoffensive. But it is political. If BLM is cool, then how can de Blasio discriminate against empowering women? But that's just the next baby step, which will eventually reach the National Rifle Association, ('Protect Your Right To Keep and Bear Arms') and, eventually, NAMBLA ('Love Knows No Bounds'?) on the heels of the Communist Party ('Workers of the World Unite'). Commercial speech is different, but these are all political views and just as entitled, under the Constitution, as BLM to a spot on Fifth Avenue. Why not? Obviously, this presents a problem. Not so much for the unduly passionate, who won't be shaken from their belief that Black Lives Matter exists on a different plane from all other political speech that immunizes it from all constitutional scrutiny, plus the Constitution is just a worthless rag created to protect racist old white men anyway, so who cares what it says, but for the courts and the rest of us who aren't prepared to trash the Constitution when it gets in the way of the woke. Now that Bill de Blasio has opened up Pandora's Avenue, what will he do? Black Lives Matter has already been painted on Fifth, so he can't make that disappear. The deed is done. He can just ignore the request by Women for America First, letting it languish and compelling them to sue for relief. Will they sue or will they let it slide? Any court worth its beans is going to find that same injustice in an effort to ban any large gathering that's expressing or celebrating almost anything — ethnic or neighborhood pride, say — as long as the mayor is explicitly permitting mass-gathering 'speech' that he deems important. The law couldn't be more clear: Elected officials don't get to discriminate in that way; de Blasio looks like a bigot, or an idiot, for trying. To be fair, nobody likes de Blasio in New York City, where he was spanked by the cops[8] at the start of his tenure and has neither been a bold enough ally to social justice to attain the support of progressives nor hard enough on the woke to be the hero of the harsh. It's not that he's caught in the middle exactly, as he holds no moderate political philosophy, but rather that he tries to play both sides, but does so poorly. But will de Blasio be tarred as a bigot (or an idiot) for trying? It's not as if there's no precedent for favoring one group over another on Fifth Avenue.

September 16, 2020
Mayor Bill de Blasio : Good morning, everybody. Well, we all know the last six months we've been through so much in this city. Coronavirus has touched every single family and has, in so many ways, upended lives. And we talk every day here about the health reality about fighting back against this disease, making this city safer and healthier all the time, helping to bring us back in a way that emphasizes health and safety. So, let's talk today about the people we're depending on the people who have been heroes throughout this process, our City workforce, our public servants, the people who have stood up for this city through thick and thin, put us in a position now to be the envy of the nation in terms of the battle against the coronavirus. One of the lowest infection rates anywhere in America and our public workers have led the way. And our public workforce is crucial to restarting the city and moving us forward. We have so much to do, and yet we are also facing an unprecedented budget challenge. Literally unprecedented.
Now, I have to tell you, here we are in the middle of September, I couldn't have imagined no action by Washington, D. C. up to this point. I could not have imagined. Honestly, if you go back to May, June, July, I thought it was an article of faith that there would be a federal stimulus. There hasn't been, and I see no indication there will be for the remainder of this year. I truly believe that our colleagues in Albany would have acted by now on long-term borrowing. I still believe that can happen and hopefully very soon. But right now, we don't have that support and we have to keep making tough choices to move the city forward, to keep our budget balanced. That's the law, something we have to do, but also protect our workforce at the same time.
Now, I'll tell you something over the last seven years, we've proven that you can be fiscally responsible and make investments in this city that reach working people, that reach every neighborhood, all five boroughs; can invest in the public workforce and you get so much back for that investment. And there's so many indicators of that. Look, at the investments in our Health + Hospital system. Look how crucial that was when this crisis came in terms of protecting New Yorkers and then allowing us to come back. Look at the investments we've made in our children through initiatives like pre-K, 3-K. Look at how much that has yielded for this city. The investments that we have made consistently to improve life in the city, also before this pandemic gave us the strongest economy we've ever had and helped us to keep moving forward. So, we've got to protect our investments while at the same time being fiscally responsible, that's the balance we've always struck.
And we decided to create record reserves, put aside money constantly to prepare for a crisis. We never knew this would be that crisis, but we were ready with huge unprecedented fiscal reserves. We created a new Capital Stabilization Reserve to give us further protection. We found billions of dollars in savings every year, including health care savings, working with our partners in labor. All this work happened years and years before the pandemic and all this work continues right now and will continue in the future. So, in the worst days of this pandemic also was the time we have to put together the budget for the year we're in now. We achieved the largest savings plan in the history of this administration. We continued to find billions and billions of dollars in new savings. This current fiscal year budget is $7 billion less than what had been projected in February. And, look, even with the crisis we saw in the years leading up that New York City was regarded by the larger financial community as a very smart bet. In fact, our bond rating was increased last year, upgraded. So, we have to remember that all those strengths have been historic, and we will continue to build on them. In fact, we find new ways continually. We actually created a rainy-day fund, something no previous administration had ever done. So, we keep layering year after year, these additional protections.
But now dealing with the biggest jolt to our lives, to our families, to our neighborhoods, to our economy, to our budget that we have seen in generations. We lost $9 billion in revenue. And that's why, as I said, it led to a $7 billion cut in this year's budget. And a constant focus on finding additional savings and efficiencies, and we will be talking about this constantly from now until the last day of this administration. Now, look, we've already had to make some tough cuts that have affected the city and the services we provide. We're trying to do everything we can to stop from those cuts becoming worse. We do not want to take away jobs from public employees. We do not want to take away services from communities that need it. We're going to try and do everything we can and keep fighting for that stimulus from Washington, keep fighting for that long-term borrowing from Albany, but also keep making additional moves here. So, the Mayor's Office has focused my office directly, the people who worked directly for me here in City Hall and in the offices that make up the Mayor's Office, we focused on savings. And over the previous budgets, we found $12 million in savings within our budgets. We've had a hiring freeze, we've had constant focus on downsizing teams, wherever appropriate. And today is a day where we have to take another step. So, I'm announcing that as of October 1st every Mayor's Office employee will be taking a furlough. And that obviously it includes myself.
This is something I want to be clear about. Everyone will be taking a week's furlough. This is a step you never want to see for good hardworking people. The folks who work here throughout this crisis, they have not been working 35- or 40-hour weeks, they've been working 80-hour weeks, 90-hour weeks, 100-hour weeks because they believe in this city and they've been fighting for all of you. So, it is with pain that I say they and their families will lose a week's pay, but it's something we have to do. It's something I have to do. And with these furloughs and with the additional savings and cuts that we achieved in the June budget, the Mayor's Office budget will now be 12 percent less this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year. So, we're showing that at the very top of the operation more important actions are being taken every day and that we will make the choices we have to, to keep this city going forward. But, again, I want to thank all of the folks who do this work, and it was not a decision I made lightly to have to do this, it is painful for them and their families, but it is the right thing to do at this moment in history. Now, we'll keep fighting for those bigger changes. And I want to ask every New Yorker to join in that fight, pushing your federal representatives to help us get that stimulus, pushing your representatives in Albany for that long-term borrowing. We need to find bigger solutions, but this is another step today to find every answer we can right here within the City government.
Let me talk today about another challenge that we have faced. And as I said, this crisis, the coronavirus has affected every neighborhood, every person, every family, and it's had a lot of different impacts, health, first and foremost, the people we've lost, the families who have gone through pain, but it's not just the horrible losses within families or the people who have lost jobs, it's also that we've seen something very ugly, very negative throughout this crisis. And that's discrimination, hatred, bias directed at our Asian American communities. And so wrongly, so unfairly. These are communities that contribute so much to this city. Our Asian American communities are part of what make New York City great. In fact, sadly communities in this city in places like Chinatown, Flushing, Queens, and Southern Brooklyn, were feeling the effects of this crisis even before many other New Yorkers were because they were suffering discrimination.
People wouldn't go to their stores or the restaurants, that was painfully wrong. And I tried to show through my own actions that that kind of discrimination was wrong and wasn't acceptable and wasn't consistent with the values of the city, but we still see, unfortunately, hate crimes directed towards Asian Americans. We see verbal attacks, physical attacks. We see people blaming a community here for a virus that originated far away, and that people here had nothing to do with at all. And yet, somehow, they're being blamed and that's unacceptable. We will not allow it and we'll fight back against it. So, that's why the NYPD has created a permanent Asian Hate Crimes Task Force. That's dedicated to working with the community to make sure every attack, every incident of bias is reported, and acted on. The best way to stop these things, besides educating people and leading by example, is to show that there will be consequences, and how the NYPD is devoted to this work. And I want you to hear about the details from the leader of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo.
Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, NYPD : Thank you, Mayor de Blasio. Good morning. I'm Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo of the NYPD's newly formed Asian Hate Crime Task Force. It's an honor for me to be here today to talk about something and announce something that I find very special and positive. If I may, I'd like to start with a quick quote from Martin Luther King that I found relevant to current events and today's topic. ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness. Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that."" And yet too often today's times we see actions and rhetoric filled with hate and discrimination only to be [inaudible] with using more hate and more discrimination. I think we all stand to benefit by reflecting on the wisdom and the work of Martin Luther King, Jr. To touch on what the Mayor said, COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on all of us. It's affected our health. It's affected our finances. It's affected our overall well-being. Some of us have even lost loved ones, but it's been a little worse for the Asian American community. Since the pandemic, Asians have faced a concerning increase in unprovoked racist, verbal attacks, some of them leading to physical assaults. They have become victims of crimes for no reason other than the fact that they are of a certain race. This is the impetus for the formation of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force.
There are many unique obstacles in helping an Asian crime victim, whether it's language barrier, cultural differences, fear of retaliations, general reluctance of making a report, or distrust of the police. This task force will bridge that gap. And we have already done so successfully on a number of occasions. Just to be clear, this task force is a support unit under the overall Hate Crimes Task Force Commander Mark Molinari, which investigates all hate crimes. Underneath him, the Asian Hate Crime Task Force is myself, two captains, two sergeants, and 25 of the world's greatest detectives, skilled and dedicated Asian American investigators who are fluent in a variety of languages, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, [inaudible] Tagalog. Okay. And more important, to help solve these crimes, the task force serves two purposes. The first one is it brings awareness to the problem awareness leads to education, which I believe ultimately will lead to prevention. And the second one, it sends a clear message, a clear message from the leadership of this city and that messages that we support justice. We know the hardship you're going through. We care and we are doing something about it. So, I encourage anyone who is a victim, or knows someone who's a victim of a hate crime or any crime for that matter to come forward so we can help prevent this from happening again. The only thing right now, that's more contagious than COVID is hate. So, I ask everyone to do their part and stop the spread. Thank you.
Mayor : Thank you so much, Deputy Inspector. I want to thank you and the whole team you're working with for the great work you're doing, it's such an important work. And Deputy Inspector, you heard the passion with which he spoke about this work, but he also in describing the members of his team and all the languages they speak, the rich heritage they bring to this work, it's a reminder of today's NYPD that represents every community of this city. That is a more and more diverse force reaching deep into communities with a strategy of neighborhood policing. And this fits perfectly the strategy. We want to be shoulder to shoulder with Asian American communities fighting hate, and the NYPD is leading the way. So, Deputy Inspector, thank you for your great work and thank you for invoking the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. because that's one of his most powerful quotes, because it reminds us, as angry as we get, when we see hatred and bias, we have to overcome it with something more positive, and we do need to educate, we do need to change hearts and minds. So, another important initiative to fight against prejudice, to fight against racism, to fight against bias is being created by our Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes.
This is another part of the Mayor's Office that does such important work, working with communities, working at the grass roots to help educate everyone, but particularly our young people. And so a new contest, and it's a beautiful one, it's called Heart Work Against Hate. And the idea is to invite young people, to submit positive messages, positive images, ideas that will help us create respect and unity in this city. It's the most diverse place on earth, where there is a lot of sense of common cause especially now, as we fight this virus. We've got to keep showing those positive messages, messages of love will win the day. And so we're inviting these young people to submit their best ideas, their messages, and then we'll choose some that will be showcased on the office's website. And we'll use social media to spread the word all over the city. We're going to let the youth of this city speak to the future. We want to let them speak about the city they want to create, in a city that works for everyone.
Okay, let me switch gears now a couple of things I want to say that relate to again, our public workforce and the important work they do. So, we have more work to do, even with huge budget constraints, we have more work to do to keep working on the quality of life every day in this city. And we know with a tight budget that it's been tough in terms of what we've seen in some of our streets and parks. And, we want to improve the cleanliness level. So, we will be restoring approximately 65 litter basket pickup trucks through the Sanitation Department every week. That'll be a 24 percent increase over current levels. And that Sanitation the Economic Development Corporation they'll restart a great initiative, it's called Clean NYC, working with the DOE Fund. A lot of you have seen out there, good, good men and women out there turning their own lives around, but doing great work, helping communities to be clean. We're going to be extending that effort in a number of neighborhoods and parks around the city. So, those efforts, and we've found some additional changes that we've made in our budget to allow for those. But we're also recognizing there's a lot of people beyond the City government, a lot of community-based organizations, elected officials, a lot of folks in the private sector are sponsoring their own cleanup efforts with their own employees or with volunteers from the community. And that's fantastic. I'm seeing that happen more and more all over the city. Want to thank everyone who's doing community cleanups. We need your help. We're going to keep doing everything we can to get the most done from the public sector, but everyone else who is contributing, it makes a huge difference. And, of course, I want to thank all the good men and women at the Sanitation Department who do this work every day for us. No matter what the situation they're always there for us. I remember after Sandy, the heroic role they played bringing back the city. I remember what has happened in snowstorm after snowstorm. Whatever's thrown at the Sanitation Department, they respond and they're going to help us through this crisis as well.
And while I'm thanking and appreciating public workers, these folks don't work for the City of New York, but they sure do serve every one of us, our postal workers, everyone who's part of the United States Postal Service. Thank you. You know what? We need you more than ever. You, in fact, are not only our lifelines for so many people, you bring medicines, you bring the resources that people will wait on regularly when they need help. You bring information. You keep families united. The work you do is absolutely precious. And dare I say, you are also guardians of democracy because more and more people are going to be casting their votes through you. So, to all of you, thank you. Thank you for everyone who works for the postal service. There may be all sorts of debates and controversies in Washington, but here on the ground in New York City, we just appreciate all of you and we need you, and we're going to do everything we can to help you be strong.
Okay, let's go to our daily indicators. Number one, daily number of people admitted to New York City hospitals for suspected COVID-19 that threshold is 200 patients, and today's report is 75, with a confirmed positive rate for COVID amongst those patients of 11.54 percent. Number two, new reported cases on a seven-day average, that threshold 550, today's report 277 cases. And number three, percentage of people testing citywide positive for COVID-19, threshold is five percent, today's report 0.87 percent. A good number thanks to all of you. Few words now in Spanish
[Mayor de Blasio speaks in Spanish]
With that, we'll turn to our colleagues and the media. Please let me know the name and outlet of each journalist.
Moderator: Hey guys, we'll now begin our Q-and-A. As a reminder, we're joined today by Deputy Mayor Laura Anglin, Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza, OLR Commissioner Renee Campion, Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, and Senior Advisor Dr. Jay Varma. With that, our first question today goes to Hazel from WCBS.
Question: Good morning, Mr. Mayor. How are you?
Mayor: How's it going, Hazel?
Question: Good, good. I have a question for you and for Chancellor Carranza. We were at P.S. 63 on the Lower East Side yesterday, where we found classrooms with broken windows, others that wouldn't open more than maybe three inches or the windows were screwed shut, and they had very poor ventilation. Now, these are classrooms that teachers tell me they reported for poor air circulation years ago, issues before a COVID-19, yet these classrooms were given a passing grade by the ventilation action team and students will be in these classrooms on Monday. Now, we've received similar complaints from several other schools. We had a teacher literally in tears yesterday, worried about students and teachers getting sick and getting a family sick. So, my question is, will the City go back to P.S. 63 and other schools and fix these issues in classrooms where teachers feel the inspections were flawed?
Mayor: Hazel, I appreciate you telling me about this. I don't want to see any classroom online that shouldn't be. If a classroom isn't ready for our kids and our educators, it shouldn't be used. So, we will absolutely send the team back to P.S. 63 today to see exactly what happened. And if any classroom is not up to snuff, it'll be taken out of circulation immediately. And it will not be used until it is fixed. So, I welcome any reports, anything that needs to be fixed we will either be able to fix it immediately in time for Monday or we will not use that room until it is fixed. It's as simple as that. Go ahead.
Question: My second question that's the principal's union still saying 2,000 additional teachers is not enough. Some teachers are now concerned that they're being assigned to teach subjects they've never taught before. For example, teachers finding out PE teachers finding out they're now teaching math, and they just have a few days before school starts and little time to prepare. How do you respond to the critics that say, this won't be the best education for New York City public school students?
Mayor: Look, Hazel, I've been around our public schools a long time as a parent, as a public servant, and I can tell you that there's constantly adjustments that have to be made, but this year more than ever, because we're in a pandemic. And we're asking everyone to use their skills, their talents to help our kids. Of course, people are only going to be asked to do things they can do. We're not going to ask people to do things they can't do, but we are going to ask everyone to dig down deep to serve our children. Our children are hurting, Hazel. They have missed months and months of in-person instruction last year, they've been through a lot of trauma, they need the support of educators, they need positive adult role models, they need people to help them. And I have not met a single person in our labor unions or anywhere else who says that we can serve our children as well remotely as we do in-person. And we're not starting from, you know, scratch here. We're talking about kids who already have been set back months and months. So, we're only going to ask people to do what they can do, but we're going to ask them to do a lot, because our kids deserve it. Chancellor, would you like to add?
Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza: Mr. Mayor, I think you covered that right on.
Mayor: Okay. Thank you. Go ahead.
Moderator: For our next question, we'll go to Andrew from WNBC.
Mayor: Good morning, everyone. Mayor, for weeks, you've been saying that there were going to be enough educators, but our understanding and maybe we'll get the Chancellor to weigh in on this as well is that late last night, the DOE concluded there will not be enough to guarantee live instruction on the blended remote days. So, I'm wondering what you say to parents who have been told you'll get live instruction every single day and have now been told, maybe not.
Mayor: I'll start and turn to the Chancellor. Andrew, look, we are starting up a huge endeavor to serve our children and our parents. From the very beginning, parents of this city spoken said they wanted their kids back in school. And we've heard this from parents of all backgrounds, every neighborhood, every walk of life, but we've particularly heard this from parents who are less privileged, whose kids need more help, whose kids are dealing with a lot of challenges and desperately want the positive environment of the classroom again. So, we're starting on Monday. We've said repeatedly, it will not be a perfect start, we'll be making a lot of adjustments in the weeks after we begin to continue to improve things. But the important reality here is to say, we're going to start by providing the best education possible in-person, the best education possible remotely. We're going to keep making improvements as we go along, we're going to keep adjusting and figuring out what we need in terms of staffing. We've come this far. We're going to keep doing what we have to do to make it better every single day. It's not static, Andrew. It's not like what happens on the first day by the way, this is true in a typical school year what happens the first day is not the same as how things are two weeks or three weeks or four weeks later after a lot of things have been worked through. Even in a regular school year without a pandemic, they're adding staff into schools even a few weeks into the school year. So, we're going to make adjustments, but, over time, we're going to be continuing to improve the quality both in classroom and remote. Go ahead, Chancellor.
Chancellor Carranza: Yes, sir. What I would add is I would amplify what you just said. This is the start of the school year. We're going to continue to make adjustments. But also, all of the variables keep adjusting as well. How many students are in-person? How many students have chosen remote? How many of our staff members are seeking medical accommodations and what does that look like? And then, the space issue. So, there are constant variables at play here. And what we've chosen to do is be honest and transparent with the public and say to folks our goal has always been synchronous instruction every single day. But as we look at the first day and know that we're working through some of these staffing challenges, we're being honest with the public, nobody's hiding anything here. So, you're almost darned if you do and darned if you don't. But we're going to be transparent with families and let them know that this will be some of your education remotely will be asynchronous. And that can still be very rigorous assignments, very rigorous lessons that students complete. And as we continue to ramp up, as you've said, Mr. Mayor, we're going to continue to add capacity to provide and meet our goal, which has synchronous instruction every single day.
Mayor: Go ahead, Andrew.
Question: Yes, on a totally different topic. As we speak, at this moment, Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani is holding a news conference, outlining what he views to be the way to bring back the city from some difficulties right now. And specifically, what he's calling for is the hiring of 9,000 additional police officers to help deal with the rise in shootings and the homeless problem. I wonder what your reaction to that is.
Mayor: I think he has amnesia. I think he's out of touch with reality. I think we've seen more and more Rudy Giuliani become unhinged, and I'm just not waiting around to hear what he thinks. We have the greatest police force in the country. Up to this pandemic, this police force had driven down crime year after year after year. They've been dealing with a perfect storm and yet they're fighting back really valiantly. But, unlike in Giuliani's time, this police force works with the people in New York City, works with the neighborhoods, listens to people and tries to create unity and common cause with the people in the neighborhoods of the city. And that's what's going to work in the long haul.
Moderator: Next up is Michael Gartland from the Daily News.
Question: Hey, Mr. Mayor. How are you doing?
Mayor: Hey, Michael. How are you?
Question: I'm alright. So, on these furloughs you talked about at the top of the press conference, why why now? I mean, you've been talking about borrowing for months now and, you know, the fiscal hawks and, you know, some of the State lawmakers we've talked to said, you know, we need to find more savings before we take that step. So, I mean, why wait until now? Why not why not kind of take this step earlier on in the process?
Mayor: Michael, look, first of all, as I said, for months, I think many, many people, including folks who are pretty objective about politics and government thought there would be a stimulus. I think we're all shocked that hasn't happened. Based on lots of conversations with leaders in Albany and members of the Legislature, I thought they were going to move forward long-term borrowing. They did it after 9/11, they should do it now. But since it hasn't happened, were looking for every possible way to make the moves that we can make while continuing the conversations with long-term borrowing, while continue conversations with labor over savings. But, Michael, I don't think you would like it if your boss said, hey, Michael, you're going to lose a week's pay. I don't think it's something that we want to do to anyone, especially people have been working so hard. These folks have worked nonstop. A lot of the people in this building have worked every single day since the pandemic began. I don't want to take money away from them and their families, but it's at the point where we have to show that we're going to do anything and everything to get through this. Go ahead. Michael Michael?
Moderator: Do you have a second question?
Question: Can you hear me?
Mayor: There you go.
Question: Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Does it give you some leverage, moving forward? Have you gotten any feedback on that? As far as the borrowing in Albany, and as far as you know, the negotiations, I know you you've been in with labor leaders as far as, you know, figuring out some things there to find savings?
Mayor: Look, the work we're doing with labor has been going on nonstop and they've been, you know, productive and respectful conversations. I think a lot of the folks who lead our municipal unions understand this is about saving the city and our future. But we're taking this action because it's the thing we have to do now. I certainly think it says to people, you know, everyone's trying to do what they can, everyone sacrificing in some way. Let's all keep working together. I mean, I hope it does send some of that message.
Moderator: Next up is Henry from Bloomberg.
Question: Hello, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to ask you
Mayor: Go ahead.
Question: How are you doing?
Mayor: How are you doing, man?
Question: Okay. So, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about this furlough program. Do you think you'd extend it citywide to the entire workforce? What the intent of this action today and how much money will you really save doing this?
Mayor: The amount we save by this action is somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars, combined with the other actions we've taken. As I said, the Mayor's Office budget is now 12 percent less this year, this fiscal year we're in now compared to the fiscal year that ended in June. I think everything's on the table to your original question, everything's on the table, Henry. We're talking to labor about any and all ways to save money. We're going to be looking at all options at this point, because, again, the things that we needed the stimulus, the long-term borrowing, they're not here. And times a-wasting, we're going to look at every option to address the situation. Go ahead.
Question: I'm wondering why you have gone this route instead of any several other ways that you could raise money that are, you know, just as draconian, perhaps, but would raise a lot more money. A one percent property tax increase, which the City has power over would raise about $750 million. It would cost the average homeowner about $75 a year. Why not look at other possibilities?
Mayor: I just don't believe a property tax increases the right thing and I won't do it. And I just won't do a property tax increase. That's off the table, period. People in this city are hurting in a way that is unprecedented. The only thing that compares, you have to go back to the great depression. The last thing we're going to ask people to do is to have to pay more working people, middle class people, struggling to keep it together and over a million people have lost their jobs. We're not going to ask them to pay more in property taxes off the table. Go ahead.
Moderator: Next up is Reema, from Chalkbeat.
Question: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I have a couple of questions. My first one is about the budget. So, obviously we know that with schools, there are new costs the City is shouldering while reopening. For example, the PPE, the cleaning supplies, but with the 20 percent of school aid being withheld from, you know, the recurring payments from the State, we know that districts outside of New York are already cutting staff and making other cuts. So, I'm wondering how is New York City able to pay for these new costs with essentially 20 percent less in payments coming in?
Mayor: Well, Reema, obviously what we get from the State is one part of the resources to go to schools. And again, our fight is going to be to make sure we do get that money, eventually. But the bigger answer to you is the team at Office of Management and Budget manages our money very carefully. A lot of other parts of the state are in a really horrible situation, and I feel for them, and they don't have a lot of flexibility. We at least have some flexibility, because our team manages our client cashflow well and we have resources that continue to come in. That's not true of a lot of other places, the way that they get their revenue is just different. But the bottom line here is, we're going to keep doing everything it takes to serve our kids well over half-a-million kids who need our help and deserve it, and parents are demanding that we serve them. And we're going to keep fighting for the long-term borrowing, we're going to keep fighting for the stimulus and all of the things that would make things right. But, in the meantime, we have to serve these kids. Go ahead, Reema.
Question: Okay. My second question is about the protocol for when somebody tests positive for the coronavirus, like a school staffer or a student or someone. So, the teachers union and the principals union both brought up [inaudible] delays in informing schools about positive tests. We know last night we got a list from the DOE about which schools so far have staffers who've tested positive. But the City's protocol says the City needs to confirm a self-reported positive case. And in the spring, we know this meant getting confirmation from DOH, which slowed down the process of closing schools at first. So, could you explain or, can somebody maybe from the Health Department explain exactly how the City is confirming tests? Like, we've heard it can take as little as minutes, but how does that confirmation process work and how is it being done any more quickly than this spring?
Mayor: I appreciate it, Reema. It is being done a lot more quickly, a lot more effectively, because we have the situation what I'd like to do, if the team here thinks we can pull it off, is get Commissioner Melanie La Rocca on the line and have Reema come back as soon as Melanie joins us, because she can give you a very precise answer to how the process is working and why it's so much quicker. I've talked it through with her, but I want you to hear it from her. It is a very different situation than March. March was horrible for everyone. We didn't even know in February that the pandemic was already spreading in the city because we didn't have testing. By the time we got into March, we had a much bigger problem than anyone knew, and we were all trying to do our best. This is a situation today where we've had six months to prepare. We have a situation room that's able within minutes to verify those tests, but I want make sure you hear it directly from Melanie. So, we'll take a timeout on Reema, get Melanie, and we'll go to the next question in the meantime.
Moderator: So, next up is Brigid from WNYC.
Question: Good morning, everybody. My first question is for the Chancellor. Chancellor Carranza, can you talk more specifically about what the DOE has done to close the digital divide over the summer to ensure that all school families will have access to internet for reliable remote learning today?
Chancellor Carranza: Sure. So, Brigid, what we've done is we've distributed over 340,000 Wi-Fi-enabled devices. We've also worked with the internet providers, and they were very helpful in March by providing free Wi-Fi service for students in temporary housing, low-income students, etcetera. We are working with them to continue that service to our city during this academic year as well. But in addition, we've also purchased some hotspots a good number of hotspots. I believe that number we'll verify it, but it's over 40,000 of these hotspots that we are also assigning to students that we know don't have internet connectivity as well. We've also set up on our website, a place where students or families can go and indicate that they need a device or they need internet connectivity. Also, they can call 3-1-1. And then, I know that our schools, as they're preparing for the start of the school year, have reached out to families and students to make sure that they do have a device, they do have kind connectivity. And if they don't, then we're in communication with them to provide them those either devices or connectivity.
Mayor: Just a quick follow-up on that Brigid. This is, you know, we've been through a horrible crisis, but even in the midst of crisis something striking happened where everyone pulled together. DOE did an amazing job mounting this effort to get devices and internet service to hundreds of thousands of kids that didn't have it. They did that within a matter of weeks. A lot of companies really stepped up and helped us in that. It was an extraordinary effort in the midst of crisis, but it also ended up being one of the biggest efforts in New York City history to address the digital divide. And really one of the most profound actions that's ever been taken to address the digital divide. So even in the midst of crisis, something positive happened and I really want to credit the Chancellor's team for what they did to pull that together. Go ahead, Brigid.
Question: And for the Mayor and the Chancellor. I know we've talked some about this this morning, but of course we're still hearing from schools that they haven't gotten the additional staff that they need despite, you know, this thing 2,000 teachers are arriving. We know it's the beginning and things will evolve, but I'm wondering where some of these are [inaudible] when they're were arriving and how are you keeping track of the schools that have these needs?
Mayor: I'll start and turn to the Chancellor. One thing that this Chancellor did and I give him a lot of credit for it. He created a much stronger system. First Deputy Chancellor, Executive Superintendent, superintendents, a really smart system for having leadership that connects down to the grassroots and backup to the Chancellor. So that system is working every day, determining exactly what each school needs. Again as the Chancellor said, as you get different numbers coming in about which students will be where et cetera. As I said yesterday, we have hundreds of schools that now are reporting that they do have what they need. We have others that definitely need at least a handful, more teachers. Those teachers are being assigned. They're arriving today, tomorrow, the next day, some will arrive even on Monday, but honestly that happens even in a regular school year. But that's going to be constant. And if we identify greater needs, I've said it before. I'll say it again really clearly. If we need to go beyond those 2,000, if it turns out there are additional needs and we've gotten all the folks that we have in the DOE who are classroom ready and they're all out in their assignments. If we need to go deeper into our substitute pool, we will. There's thousands and thousands of substitutes ready to go and we can bring them on and we can bring them on in a longer term manner. So whatever that true number is, as we keep working school by school to define the final need, they will get what they need. Go ahead, Chancellor.
Chancellor Carranza: I would only add sir, that the superintendents are working very closely with schools. So we are monitoring what the actual needs are of schools in terms of staffing as they're putting their models together. And I mentioned earlier in another response about all of the changing variables that principals are having to juggle with right now from enrollment to accommodations, et cetera. So superintendents are really the vehicle by which they're communicating that up to us from a human capital perspective. And then as you said, we're assigning licensed personnel to be in schools. And that's a process that's been going on this week. We've narrowed the list of schools that have some really difficult staffing challenges, and we're obviously concentrating on them. But as was also mentioned one of the variables is that teachers have to be teaching in their area of expertise. So all of those things are happening as we speak and will continue to happen even after the first day as the new school year gets started.
Mayor: Excellent.
Moderator: Next up is Luis from New York [Inaudible].
Mayor: Luis? Luis, can you hear me?
Moderator: Luis, we are waiting for you?
Mayor: I'm not sure he can hear us. Do we have, in the meantime, do we have Melanie La Rocca on?
Moderator: We do not have Commissioner La Rocca, almost. In the interim
Mayor: Okay. We're getting all these pieces will come together like a ballet. Okay. Luis, can you hear me? Why don't we go to the next person and bring back Luis as well?
Moderator: In the interim, we'll go to Abu from Bangla Patrika.
Mayor: Abu, can you hear me?
Question: Yes.
Mayor: There you go. How are you doing? How's it going?
Question: Good. How are you?
Mayor: Good.
Question: Okay. My question is as you mentioned, the hate crime and all this stuff going on, as you know, the highest office of the nation and the [inaudible] the United States is telling this disease, Chinese disease he's calling again a Chinese disease and you are telling about the discrimination And stop the discrimination. What is your comment on it? And do you talk too many times to the president I know we know it's a strained relation between you and the president, but did you ever tell him to stop Chinese disease, calling it Chinese disease?
Mayor: You know Abu, the times I've talked to the president, honestly, were in the very height of the crisis and I was trying to get us medical supplies and PPE and testing. So that was the focus then. I also think, unfortunately, this president is making a very conscious choice. When he says something as awful as that Abu, it's a purposeful effort to divide. It is part of a political strategy. There's been a lot of demagogues over time who have tried to divide people ethnically and racially and by religion. And it's unfortunately a very, very old part of human life that there are people who will do that, no matter how painful it is, no matter how wrong it is. So no, I don't think anyone's going convince him this is a guy who remember back in the 1980's called for the execution of the Central Park Five. Even though they were innocent, he wanted these young men executed. Thank God they are alive and well today and out of prison. In fact, it was this administration that settled that case once and for all. But no, he's not going to change. And he just has to be defeated. Go ahead.
Question: Also, my question is since coronavirus happened the [inaudible] ICE, you know, they paused deportation, but they announced again, aggressively deporting people. Catching the people and deporting. And New York City is a sanctuary city, what kind of assistance you are going to provide the people who need you know the help?
Mayor: Yeah. I'll tell you Abu, it's a great question. And I do think despite the bluster, and we see this pattern constantly coming from the president and from Washington of all the horrible things they're going to do to us, that never happened. Of all, you know, they're going to have massive raids, all these things they threatened that they don't do. And thank God they don't do them because they're wrong and they're counterproductive. And they would hurt people. It would be bad for this city in this country. But what we've seen in reality is that people in our immigrant communities, I really believe have heard the message that New York City is a place that respects all immigrants, regardless of documentation status. That our police department, our school system, our public hospitals, none of them will allow ICE agents on their property. The NYPD will not ask documentation status. We provide the legal support for free to folks who are immigrants who are endangered. We want to keep families together. We hate when families are separated as part of what again, ICE has become a political wing of the Trump administration in so many ways. So I do think that message has spread deeply in our immigrant communities. And people know they will get help and respect. And even things like the way we provide support, we've been providing free food to everyone, regardless of documentation status. We provide free health care. Our guaranteed health care initiative is for all New Yorkers, regardless of documentation status. Hundreds of thousands of people who legally are not allowed to have health insurance, they still can get health care for free through Health + Hospitals. I think a lot of folks feel that, and they know they are respected and protected here. Okay, let's go back and see, who do we have now?
Moderator: Do we have Commissioner La Rocca on? We're going to go shortly to Luis from New York Gold.
Question: Can you hear me?
Mayor: There you go. It's all working.
Question: Okay, great. Thank you. Hey there, Mr. Mayor. Regarding street fairs, I spoke with one of the city's largest organizers the other day, and he backed up that what you said to me a month ago. That is these folks are mostly interested in what's best for New York City. And that's a good thing, right? So Mr. Mayor, even though you haven't specifically referenced it lately, I figured the regular street fairs are a no go at this point? But as any thought been given to the holiday fairs and markets?
Mayor: It's a very good question, Luis. Basically I think you're right and I'll check on the latest in terms of our announcements, but in general, as every month has passed we've made the decision not to extend the kind of permits that existed in the past, because we can't have those kinds of gatherings. We need to keep streets clear for a lot of other things that are happening. So, and I think what we've seen overwhelmingly is folks who used to do different events, prefer themselves to do something different, something virtual or something alternative, or just to cancel for a year. The vast majority of organizations, their focus is coming back next year, hopefully in a much better environment. So we will say more on those kinds of holiday markets soon, but I think what's fair to say is everything is going to be decided based on the data and the science and, you know, health and safety first. And we got to be really careful with anything like that. Go ahead.
Question: Okay. So about keeping the streets clear, you mandated that city space be prioritized for outdoor dining and Open Streets, just as you said. And yet you've stated that outdoor dining would be taking place again next year. So, sir, I asked you as long as our health metrics are just as good, if not better than those of today, can you assure the street fair organizers and the thousands of participating merchants that your administration will work towards helping them get up and running in 2021?
Mayor: I can say this, what we've learned from this whole crisis is to make decisions based on the data and the science. That's going to be what determines everything. I do believe as you indicated that we should have Open Restaurants next year. That's the plan, that's were we are going. I think it should be made permanent. I think Open Streets has been a great success. We should be doing that every summer. And combining them has been an extraordinary success. We should do that every summer. I think that's the future of New York City. In terms of the street fairs, we've got to just make sure the time is right. So my hope is that you'll see a vaccine by spring and it is, you know, distributed and people are vaccinated by a late point in the spring, hopefully at the latest maybe even sooner. And then that season, when you see a lot of the big events in the summer, that we will be back to normal. That's my hope, but I don't want to assure anything until we get a lot closer. But I certainly want folks who have those street fairs to understand, like all the folks who have the great events in this city, our goal is to see them back next summer. Go ahead.
Moderator: For our final question, we're going to go back to Reema because we're now joined by Commissioner La Rocca.
Mayor: Do we have Reema? Reema can you hear me?
Question: Yes, I can. Thank you.
Mayor: Why don't you restate your question and then we'll have Commissioner La Rocca answer it.
Question: Okay, great. Sorry. My internet is spotty. So if I go out, just let me know. Okay. Commissioner, thanks so much for coming on. So my question was, you know, the teachers union and principals union have brought up concerns about delays in informing schools about positive coronavirus tests. The City's protocol says the City needs to confirm a self-reported positive case, but we know in the spring, this meant getting confirmation from DOH, which slowed down the process of closing schools. So can you explain how exactly the City is confirming tests this time around? Like, we've heard it can take as little as a minutes. And just how is it being done any more quickly this time around?
Commissioner Melanie E. La Rocca, Department of Buildings: Sure thing. Thank you for the question. So we put together an actual literal space. So we have DOHMH, our Test and Trace colleagues, DOE in a space. We're doing inputting calls from principals. So we want to get principals on the phone with us. So we're talking with them, understanding exactly the scenario. And then once we've got the basics of the information, we're passing that along in the system to DOHMH. DOHMH actually has a team that they've assembled, who are doing nothing but verifying the cases we're sending to them. So this team is dedicated. They're onsite and they are doing this all day throughout our hours. So we're open 5:30 to 9:30, Monday through Friday. And 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM on Sundays. That's all that team is doing. So we are putting ourselves in a place where we are ensuring that we have faster turnaround from our colleagues in DOHMH.
Mayor: Let's stay there for a second Commissioner, 5:30 AM to 9:30 PM, correct?
Commissioner La Rocca: That's correct. Monday through Friday and 11:00 AM to 9:30 PM on Sunday. And so we, again, we very much encourage our principals to contact us. They've -- we've shared the information on how to reach this room. This is really a tool that is meant explicitly for principals to help guide them through the process. Now, we know that principals have lots of questions. That's why our team is there. We want to get them the answer. And the answer may not always be that the case is a verified case. But that's what our job is. We're going to get them answers to the questions they have.
Mayor: And you had nine confirmed cases yesterday?
Commissioner La Rocco: Correct.
Mayor: Okay. And just one more to finish up on Reema's question. I think the original question was about the turnaround time? How long it takes Department of Health to confirm when you've been sent the documentation on a test? How long does it take for that situation room and the people in the situation room to confirm a positive test?
Commissioner La Rocca: Sure. So, we know for New York City residents, the turnaround time is quick. It can be a matter of you know, tens of minutes. So, we know this is a very quick turnaround and we know that the dedicated team they've put in place is ensuring that.
Mayor: So Reema, the answer to your question is minutes. The whole system is predicated on the verification of the test being as quickly as humanly possible, in many cases, just a few minutes. And then immediately taking the next steps. And we need that to go very fast. And that's why we have a situation room that's supposed to make those decisions immediately, act on them. And we have one person in charge and that's Commissioner La Rocca, who is someone who knows how to make decisions quickly to her great credit.
Okay. Everyone, as we close up, look, I just want to say you see a lot of people pulling together. You see a lot of people doing whatever it takes. You heard just then that situation room, making sure that there's action to keep our students safe and our educators, our school staff safe. That's an operation going from 5:30 in the morning to 9:30 at night. Folks are there nonstop to make sure that you're safe, your family's safe. The folks who worked for the City are sacrificing all the time because they believe in this city. The folks here at City Hall, I've been amazed. People worked again every single day since the crisis began. Our first responders, our health care heroes, our educators, the selflessness, the sacrifice that you see among our public workers is outstanding. We're going to be making some other sacrifices here at City Hall as I announced earlier. But this is what we all do. We are here to serve the public. We're going to do whatever it takes. And that's how we're going to see ourselves through this crisis. That's the spirit of this city. We're going to do what it takes to bring this city back. And I guarantee you, this city is coming back and coming back strong. Thank you, everyone."

People cross a street in Chinatown in Manhattan on April 6, 2019 in New York City. (JOHANNES EISELE / AFP)
Donald Hong, chairman of UA3, an NGO based in New York dedicated to serving the local Asian and Chinese population, painted a grim picture.
Speaking about a group of people living in the Chung Pak complex for senior citizens in Manhattan's Chinatown, he said, ""They have opened up every can they have in the house, trying to stretch them for another day or two.""
Since mid-March, UA3 has teamed up with the Trader Joe's grocery store chain, other NGOs and city officials to provide badly-needed food to these people. Hong described the supplies as a lifeline for the seniors.
When the pandemic was raging in late March and early April, tenants would open the door slightly, allowing us to pass through the food bags. However, we often put the bags outside on the floor, knocked on the door and then walked away. Before we left the floor, we could hear the squeaky sound of a door opening, followed by a shout down the hallway of 'thank you'
Kathleen Tom-Lew, a volunteer who helps the elderly in Manhattan's Chinatown
""The problem they are facing is twofold. On the one hand, the seniors, who mostly have various ailments, are afraid to go out in case they become infected. On the other, they are frightened by all the racism that has bubbled to the surface since the pandemic hit this country,"" Hong said.
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak in New York City in March and April, when the death toll peaked at more than 800 within 24 hours, everyone－caregivers, attendants and even family members－stopped visiting the seniors.
Sam Wu, superintendent of the Chung Pak complex, said: ""The overwhelming majority of the more than 110 residents are in their 80s. We also have a handful of others in their 90s and a couple more who are over 100. Infirm, and sometimes immobile, they were cut off from food sources.""
Beatrice Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, another NGO based in New York, quickly responded to the challenges seniors faced.
She and her colleagues mobilized a group of volunteers, who ensured that bags of fresh produce were delivered to the homes of those badly in need.
Chen said that at the start of the outbreak everywhere was closing－""the butcher's around the corner, nearby Chinese supermarkets, neighborhood Chinese restaurants, centers for seniors and family associations"".
By mid-March even the pantries that catered to the city's poor had been closed. ""Some of them had still been serving meals. People went in and ate－that was obviously a large gathering. Many more (pantries) simply could not find enough people to help handle and serve food safely,"" Chen said.

""We started to realize all the logistical implications if we were to open a standard pantry, where people line up to get their food. Standing in line for half an hour not only exposes seniors to a greater risk of being infected, but also is physically and mentally exhausting,"" she added.
The Community First Food Pantry Program now delivers about 250 bags of groceries twice a week to the Chung Pak residents as well as others living in tenement buildings in Chinatown and the Lower East Side, where there are huge populations of seniors.
Referring to city councilwoman Margaret Chin, the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, Chen said, ""Donald Hong approached Margaret who, thanks to her constituent services, really knows where these hard-to-reach people are.
""Every building has its own rules, and you cannot just drop off fresh produce that could rot and attract rats. We often have to go a day in advance to make sure that the tenants will be at home when we deliver. One thing the seniors really miss is meat.""
Every morning, a Trader Joe's truck carrying food arrived in Lower Manhattan, and the supplies were unloaded at 2 am.
Hong said: ""Think about 50 crates of bananas and 340 crates of eggs. We seemed to be the only pantry in Lower Manhattan dealing with fresh, perishable food, as we wanted to give people a familiar taste.""
All the food was sorted and stored at a 200-square-meter pantry owned by Chung Pak Local Development Corp, and previously occupied by a restaurant that closed due to the pandemic.
Severe damage
Charles Lai, executive director of Chung Pak LDC, who helped found the Museum of Chinese in America in New York in 1980, said, ""Only by joining hands can we possibly reach out to those who are in desperate need of help yet are hiding themselves out of fear.
""The damage our community has suffered, physically and economically, is much more severe than in most other communities. Why? Because we have a president who calls this virus the Chinese virus, and in doing so has repeatedly evoked the country's (United States) racist history, making it unsafe for us at a time when all Americans need to stand together.""
A report released by the New York Police Department shows that hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen consistently in recent months. City officials and local NGOs suspect that such incidents are underreported.

A paper issued by two NGOs－the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action－said New York state has the second-highest number of cases of discrimination related to COVID-19, after California.
Hong, citing examples of Asian Americans being physically and verbally attacked on the New York Subway, said: ""Before COVID-19, 40 percent of the people we served at our Midtown pantry on 26th Street were Asian Americans. That proportion has dropped to below 10 percent, although we now have a line that stretches for three blocks. Members of our community are not coming.""
Lai, the executive director, said: ""The impact of COVID-19 was palpably felt here even before it landed on American shores. Back in late January, when we were preparing to celebrate Chinese New Year, people were already staying away from Chinatown and Chinese businesses. After the pandemic, Chinatown will be the last place that people choose to return to.""
Business closures mean lost jobs, sometimes for an entire family, and it is not uncommon for different generations of Chinese American families in Manhattan's Chinatown to run enterprises such as restaurants.
Early last month, CNN reported that about 147,000 Asian workers in New York state had filed for unemployment benefit in the past four weeks, a 6,900 percent rise over the same period last year. The number of such filings by white workers rose by 1,840 percent and among black workers by 1,260 percent.
Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, said: ""I know people who have started rationing food among three generations of a family. Waiting for unemployment benefit－which takes months to apply for－and not knowing when they will get their jobs back, they are trying to make their food reserves last a bit longer.
""You don't really hear these stories, because they're not being told. People are also largely unaware of those who are being excluded from most federal, state and local funding resources.""
Some 1,200 meals a week are now being provided by UA3, supported by Trader Joe's and other sources. In addition to caring for seniors, the NGO provides a home for the deaf in New York and another building for the visually impaired.
Chi Loek, a UA3 board member, said: ""We are pushing to expand our services. Food insecurity is going to be with us not just for months, but for years, and will be compounded by other factors, such as housing. What we are doing right now is intended not as an emergency measure, but as a sustainable, long-term solution to a problem that might grow.""
With this in mind, UA3 last week moved its food pantry to Grand Street in Lower Manhattan, where it is expected to reach out to more people in need. The Chung Pak residents continue to be served.

Kathleen Tom-Lew, a third-generation Chinese born and raised in Chinatown, has been working as a volunteer at the Chung Pak pantry since March, and makes deliveries in the heart of Chinatown.
""Originally, we only wanted to serve the elderly, but then other tenants who were out of a job asked to be put on our list,"" said Tom-Lew, a co-founder of the New York nonprofit Chinatown Community Young Lions.
Hong and Loek from UA3 scouted Chinatown and other areas of New York to find restaurants serving Chinese food that met the NGO's standards.
""These restaurants are funded by the city to provide ready-made meals for our program. While the seniors have something that is friendly on the stomach, the money is being funneled to local Chinese businesses,"" he said.
Chen, reflecting on the situation in Chinatown since January, said: ""Citywide, we've never been considered a top priority when it comes to a time like this. Usually, there are other neighborhoods that are much worse-off than ours, but this is different. It's unprecedented.""
The lives of local Chinese Americans, including active participants in community work, have been lost during the pandemic, including that of Jean Lau Chin, an avid collector of oral histories in Chinatown.
Just two people from the Chung Pak complex－a 97-year-old woman and a 105-year-old man－have died since the outbreak, but neither from COVID-19.
According to an article in The New York Times in the middle of last month, one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the US had been reported among nursing home residents and workers.
Wu, the superintendent, said: ""Since early March, we have provided masks to everyone entering the building, including caregivers and volunteers. If anyone leaves the building and then re-enters, we give them a new mask. We also give them protective eyewear and thoroughly spray and disinfect everyone.""
Referring to the seniors, who have been told not to go outside, he said, ""We've gone out of our way to meet their needs and will continue to do so.""
Tom-Lew, who has been joined by her entire family in volunteering to help the elderly in Chinatown, spoke of the heart-warming response she has received.
""Officially, we are supposed to limit our contact only to those we are delivering to, for obvious reasons. But people wanted to thank us for our kindness by giving us something in return, such as a water bottle. One lady, who is in her 70s and ethnically Chinese, even gave me packs of gum,"" she said.
""When the pandemic was raging in late March and early April, tenants would open the door slightly, allowing us to pass through the food bags. However, we often put the bags outside on the floor, knocked on the door and then walked away.
""Before we left the floor, we could hear the squeaky sound of a door opening, followed by a shout down the hallway of 'thank you'.""

During Schumer's 1998 Senate Election, He Vowed To Visit Every Single New York County Each YearAt The Close Of 22 Years, Even As A Pandemic Rocks Our Nation, The Tradition Continues
As Senate Democratic Leader And During A Pandemic, Schumer Has Always Staunchly Believed That Visiting Every Single NY County Is Imperative To His Daily Work In U.S. Capitol, This Year As New York Faced Unimaginable Hardships It was More Important Than Ever Before; Vows To Continue This Tradition In 2021
Even a year as tumultuous as 2020, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Senate Democratic Leader, today completed his 22nd consecutive tour of all 62 New York State countiesan accomplishment that continues his track record as the first New York State public official to visit every single county in New York each year he has been in office.
Over the course of the year, Schumer made 86 county visits to Upstate New York and Long Island. He visited counties in the Capital Region 15 times; Western New York 6 times; Central New York 8 times; the Rochester-Finger Lakes 12 times; the Southern Tier 10 times; the Hudson Valley 14 times; the North Country 8 times; and Long Island 13 times.
""22 years ago, upon my election to the United States Senate in 1998, I promised that each and every year I served, I would visit all 62 of New York State's diverse counties. Not only has this ritual remained a steadfast passion of mine because of all I learn from my constituents and bring to Washington, D.C. as both a senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate,"" said Senator Schumer . ""Especially this year, when New York battled the global health and economic pandemic especially hard, visiting all 62 counties was vital for me to learn firsthand the struggles and needs of New Yorkers, from one end of the state to the other. Through a year that much has changed I, too, traveled with masks and disinfectant in tow to much smaller and more understated events one thing remained the same: my commitment, dedication, and love for New York. This year, more than ever before, I learned more about the struggles and needs of New York and saw New Yorkers resilience, perseverance, and grit and time and time again the very best New York has to offer even during our darkest of days.""
Schumer added , ""Although I've gained the title of Senate Democratic Leader, my proudest and most principal titles have been, and will always remain, New York's Senator and 'New Yorker.' At the close of twenty-two years, my beliefs are as clear as ever: 'Senators who stay in Washington and never return home are simply not doing their job.' Although this year looked a little different with online or-socially distanced events and celebrations, that's why I safely go to all of the places that I can. Whether I'm celebrating a virtual high school graduation or fighting for our first responders all over the state, I'm always learning more about New York directly from my constituents.""
Some of the key highlights include:
New York State
Delivered $167 Billion For New York In COVID Relief: During negotiations for the CARES Act, Schumer worked for days to deliver a plan that best protected New York's workers, small businesses, and health centers so they could receive the help they needed amidst the COVID crisis. The CARES Act Included:
Over $37 billion In Federal Funding For 'Unemployment Insurance On Steroids' Relief For New Yorkers: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer successfully fought for and secured a historic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance (UI). Importantly, economists have credited the UI expansion with mitigating a larger increase in poverty. The Senator conceived this plan with an understanding of how the modern New York economy functions, expanding unemployment benefits to more than 1.8 million freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors, and other workers in non-traditional employment across New York State since the start of the pandemic. The extended and expanded UI programs in the CARES Act also increased the maximum unemployment benefit amount by $600 per week above one's base unemployment compensation benefit for four months and ensured that workers who were laid-off or out of work through no fault of their own, on average, received their full pay for a full quarter. Additionally, Senator Schumer secured 100% federal financing of benefits paid through existing state Shared Work programs, allowing thousands of New York employers to avoid layoffs during the downturn by connecting their employees who are working reduced hours with partial UI compensation.
$10.7 Billion In Emergency Federal Funding For NYS Hospitals, Health Systems, And Community Health Centers: The chief architect of the 'Marshall Plan for Healthcare' in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured over $10.7 billion for New York state's hospitals, health systems, and community health centers. New York also received the lion's share of the initial $10 billion designated for 'hot spots' nationally, receiving $4.5 billion. The funding allowed hospitals and health systems across New York state to cover unreimbursed health care related expenses or make up for lost revenues attributable to the public health emergency resulting from COVID-19, especially from cancelled elective procedures, increased staffing and overtime costs, expanded bed capacity, and increased spending on supplies and equipment to meet the surge in COVID-19 patients.
More Than $55 billion In Paycheck Protection Program And Economic Injury Disaster Loan And Grant Funding For New York's Small Businesses And Nonprofits: Senator Schumer, a longtime champion of small businesses and nonprofits across New York, negotiated a small business rescue plan that allocated over $38.6 billion in forgivable loans through close to 349,000 awards to New York's small businesses and nonprofits so they could maintain their existing workforce and help pay for other expenses, including rent, mortgage, or utilities. Self-employed, independent contractors, and sole proprietors were also eligible for assistance. Schumer also fought to ensure nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business relief. Because of Schumer's efforts, a PPP set-aside was created in COVID relief legislation that passed following the CARES Act to provide more assistance to underserved businesses. This $60 billion set-aside was for lending through community lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), Minority Depository Institutions, and microloans to expand access to minority-owned and other underserved small businesses and nonprofits. This included a specific $10 billion CDFI set-aside established by the Treasury Department after Schumer's relentless advocacy. Senator Schumer also fought to create in the CARES Act a new Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) cash advance grant program that provided more than $1.3 billion in grant funding to over 450,000 New York small businesses and nonprofits. More than $17.3 billion in EIDL loan assistance was awarded as well. In addition, Schumer successfully added farms and value-added farm businesses as eligible recipients of EIDL loans and grants to provide New York's agricultural economy a lifeline in this crisis.
Over $3.4 Billion For Economic Development And Public Infrastructure through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): With $1 billion allocated to New York state and over $2.4 billion allocated directly to communities across New York, Senator Schumer secured over $3.4 billion in CDBG funding in the CARES Act that supports local economic growth, community revitalization, and affordable housing. The funding allows New York state and communities to create good-paying jobs, continue delivering essential services, and invest in affordable housing at a time when the COVID crisis had endangered all community services.
Over $4 billion For New York Transit Systems: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured $4,158,708,448 for transit systems across New York State. The funding enabled transit systems to continue operating safely during the pandemic to allow essential workers to commute to their jobs and act as a lifeline for transit riders without a car to continue to access every day essential services.
Over $411 Million For New York Airports: As the COVID-19 crisis immediately impacted the travel industry, Senator Schumer secured $411,274,414.22 in the CARES Act for airports all across New York state. The funding increased the federal share in the Airport Improvement program and other grants already planned for the fiscal year 2020, to 100%. The additional funding and elimination of the local share allowed for critical safety and capacity projects to continue as planned despite the financial impact of the COVID crisis on airports.
Over $15.7 Billion In Direct Cash Payments To Individuals And Families Across the State: The CARES Act provided critical financial support in the form of one-time Economic Impact Payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples below a certain income threshold, as well as an additional $500 payment per dependent child. More than 9.8 million of these direct cash payments were delivered to lower and middle-income New Yorkers this year, helping working families cover their household expenses and weather this unprecedented economic crisis. Senator Schumer also successfully called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reverse its original guidance and streamline these direct payments to Social Security recipients, ensuring that seniors and other vulnerable New Yorkers would not have to take an additional, unnecessary step of filing tax returns in order to receive this assistance.
$1.5 Billion In Testing Funding For New York State: In May, Senator Schumer announced that New York state received $1.5 billion out of a $10.25 billion national pot for coronavirus (COVID-19) testing he proposed and fought to secure as a lead negotiator in the 'Corona 3.5' legislation. Specifically, New York State received $700,248,982 and New York City received $807,512,729 that can be used for COVID-19 testing purposes, including for testing equipment and supplies, contract tracing and surveillance, personal protective equipment and more.
Secured $7 Billion In Loans For New York Hospitals And Providers: In addition to the grant money he secured, Senator Schumer secured roughly $7 billion in loans for New York hospitals and health care providers. This additional cash flow provided a lifeline to those providers as they weathered caring for Covid-19 patients and major revenue losses from shutting down as many of their services as possible. Schumer subsequently re-negotiated the repayment terms for these loans to make them far more favorable to New York providers, ensuring that they had all the resources they needed to combat the pandemic.

LONG ISLAND
Delivered Historic $2.6 Billion Federal Investment To Construct World First Electron Ion Collider At Brookhaven National Lab On Long Island: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine that would allow scientists to look inside the building blocks of an atom. In 2018 Senator Schumer, a long time benefactor of BNL, urged the Department of Energy to construct a U.S.-based EIC after a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine published a report urging immediate action to advance fundamental research into nuclear physics as a national security interest. Sen. Schumer spearheaded Congressional commitment to advancing scientific research by using his role as Democratic Leader to ensure that DOE had enough funding to advance the construction of an EIC to the solicitation phase. DOE issued a request for proposals for construction of the EIC triggering a competition between BNL and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Senator Schumer successfully made the case to DOE that BNL's track record in constructing large user facilities of national significance like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) made them the ideal choice for the EIC.

Steered Course Correction By U.S. Navy To Proactively Clean Up The Toxic Grumman Plume; Secured Navy Commitment To Finally Intercept Ever Expanding Plume After 20 Year Fight: The Navy-Grumman Plume is a 3,000+ acre mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emanating from the former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) and Grumman facilities in Bethpage which specialized in aviation, weapons and space exploration manufacturing from the 1930s to 1998. Schumer long championed the position that the state and the Navy should be working to ""hydraulically contain"" and remove the ever expanding plume from Long Island's sole source aquifer rather than focusing on its practice of ""wellhead treatment"" which addressed the problem on the surface but ignored the swiftly metastasizing chemicals underneath. For twenty years Senator Schumer advanced the ball by pushing the United States Geological Survey and later, the Navy to fully map the plume through federal legislation. With this new data secured by Senator Schumer, state health regulators realized that containment was possible and began working on a plan to contain the plume. At first recalcitrant, after Schumer's urging, the Navy began to work with the state on a plan to try to contain the ever expanding plume. In late 2020, Navy announced that they had developed a plan to intercept migrating plume, Navy would construct extraction wells along the Southern State Parkway to intercept plume before it reaches south shore communities like Massapequa and the Great South Bay.

In early 2020, DOE announced up to $625 million over five years to fund five Quantum Research Centers including the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Labs.
Sounded The Alarm On Vital Equipment Taken Off Fire Island Post-Sandy Project And Moved To Project One-Mile From Mar-A-Lago: Schumer has long-fought for federal funding to shore up costal storm protections for communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy, including the Fire Island and Moriches Inlet project off of Long Island. Part-way through the construction work to replenish beaches this year and protect residents from future storm threats, the vitally needed dredging equipmentone of just a handful off the Atlantic Coastwas pulled off the project to complete another beach dredging project at Midtown Beach in Palm Beach County, Floridaa beach that already has a sea wall and sits just a mile from Mar-A-Lagobefore turtle nesting season. Schumer called for an explanation of the decision and commitment that the dredging ship would return to Long Island on time to complete its New York work. After sounding the alarm and staying on top of the Army Corps in subsequent months, the dredge was returned to Long Island on time to resume its emergency coastal protection work.

Even a year as tumultuous as 2020, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Senate Democratic Leader, today completed his 22nd consecutive tour of all 62 New York State countiesan accomplishment that continues his track record as the first New York State public official to visit every single county in New York each year he has been in office.
Over the course of the year, Schumer made 86 county visits to Upstate New York and Long Island. He visited counties in the Capital Region 15 times; Western New York 6 times; Central New York 8 times; the Rochester-Finger Lakes 12 times; the Southern Tier 10 times; the Hudson Valley 14 times; the North Country 8 times; and Long Island 13 times.
""22 years ago, upon my election to the United States Senate in 1998, I promised that each and every year I served, I would visit all 62 of New York State's diverse counties. Not only has this ritual remained a steadfast passion of mine because of all I learn from my constituents and bring to Washington, D.C. as both a senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate,"" said Senator Schumer . ""Especially this year, when New York battled the global health and economic pandemic especially hard, visiting all 62 counties was vital for me to learn firsthand the struggles and needs of New Yorkers, from one end of the state to the other. Through a year that much has changed I, too, traveled with masks and disinfectant in tow to much smaller and more understated events one thing remained the same: my commitment, dedication, and love for New York. This year, more than ever before, I learned more about the struggles and needs of New York and saw New Yorkers resilience, perseverance, and grit and time and time again the very best New York has to offer even during our darkest of days.""
Schumer added , ""Although I've gained the title of Senate Democratic Leader, my proudest and most principal titles have been, and will always remain, New York's Senator and 'New Yorker.' At the close of twenty-two years, my beliefs are as clear as ever: 'Senators who stay in Washington and never return home are simply not doing their job.' Although this year looked a little different with online or-socially distanced events and celebrations, that's why I safely go to all of the places that I can. Whether I'm celebrating a virtual high school graduation or fighting for our first responders all over the state, I'm always learning more about New York directly from my constituents.""
Some of the key highlights include:
New York State
Delivered $167 Billion For New York In COVID Relief: During negotiations for the CARES Act, Schumer worked for days to deliver a plan that best protected New York's workers, small businesses, and health centers so they could receive the help they needed amidst the COVID crisis. The CARES Act Included:
Over $37 billion In Federal Funding For 'Unemployment Insurance On Steroids' Relief For New Yorkers: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer successfully fought for and secured a historic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance (UI). Importantly, economists have credited the UI expansion with mitigating a larger increase in poverty. The Senator conceived this plan with an understanding of how the modern New York economy functions, expanding unemployment benefits to more than 1.8 million freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors, and other workers in non-traditional employment across New York State since the start of the pandemic. The extended and expanded UI programs in the CARES Act also increased the maximum unemployment benefit amount by $600 per week above one's base unemployment compensation benefit for four months and ensured that workers who were laid-off or out of work through no fault of their own, on average, received their full pay for a full quarter. Additionally, Senator Schumer secured 100% federal financing of benefits paid through existing state Shared Work programs, allowing thousands of New York employers to avoid layoffs during the downturn by connecting their employees who are working reduced hours with partial UI compensation.
$10.7 Billion In Emergency Federal Funding For NYS Hospitals, Health Systems, And Community Health Centers: The chief architect of the 'Marshall Plan for Healthcare' in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured over $10.7 billion for New York state's hospitals, health systems, and community health centers. New York also received the lion's share of the initial $10 billion designated for 'hot spots' nationally, receiving $4.5 billion. The funding allowed hospitals and health systems across New York state to cover unreimbursed health care related expenses or make up for lost revenues attributable to the public health emergency resulting from COVID-19, especially from cancelled elective procedures, increased staffing and overtime costs, expanded bed capacity, and increased spending on supplies and equipment to meet the surge in COVID-19 patients.
More Than $55 billion In Paycheck Protection Program And Economic Injury Disaster Loan And Grant Funding For New York's Small Businesses And Nonprofits: Senator Schumer, a longtime champion of small businesses and nonprofits across New York, negotiated a small business rescue plan that allocated over $38.6 billion in forgivable loans through close to 349,000 awards to New York's small businesses and nonprofits so they could maintain their existing workforce and help pay for other expenses, including rent, mortgage, or utilities. Self-employed, independent contractors, and sole proprietors were also eligible for assistance. Schumer also fought to ensure nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business relief. Because of Schumer's efforts, a PPP set-aside was created in COVID relief legislation that passed following the CARES Act to provide more assistance to underserved businesses. This $60 billion set-aside was for lending through community lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), Minority Depository Institutions, and microloans to expand access to minority-owned and other underserved small businesses and nonprofits. This included a specific $10 billion CDFI set-aside established by the Treasury Department after Schumer's relentless advocacy. Senator Schumer also fought to create in the CARES Act a new Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) cash advance grant program that provided more than $1.3 billion in grant funding to over 450,000 New York small businesses and nonprofits. More than $17.3 billion in EIDL loan assistance was awarded as well. In addition, Schumer successfully added farms and value-added farm businesses as eligible recipients of EIDL loans and grants to provide New York's agricultural economy a lifeline in this crisis.
Over $3.4 Billion For Economic Development And Public Infrastructure through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): With $1 billion allocated to New York state and over $2.4 billion allocated directly to communities across New York, Senator Schumer secured over $3.4 billion in CDBG funding in the CARES Act that supports local economic growth, community revitalization, and affordable housing. The funding allows New York state and communities to create good-paying jobs, continue delivering essential services, and invest in affordable housing at a time when the COVID crisis had endangered all community services.
Over $4 billion For New York Transit Systems: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured $4,158,708,448 for transit systems across New York State. The funding enabled transit systems to continue operating safely during the pandemic to allow essential workers to commute to their jobs and act as a lifeline for transit riders without a car to continue to access every day essential services.
Over $411 Million For New York Airports: As the COVID-19 crisis immediately impacted the travel industry, Senator Schumer secured $411,274,414.22 in the CARES Act for airports all across New York state. The funding increased the federal share in the Airport Improvement program and other grants already planned for the fiscal year 2020, to 100%. The additional funding and elimination of the local share allowed for critical safety and capacity projects to continue as planned despite the financial impact of the COVID crisis on airports.
Over $15.7 Billion In Direct Cash Payments To Individuals And Families Across the State: The CARES Act provided critical financial support in the form of one-time Economic Impact Payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples below a certain income threshold, as well as an additional $500 payment per dependent child. More than 9.8 million of these direct cash payments were delivered to lower and middle-income New Yorkers this year, helping working families cover their household expenses and weather this unprecedented economic crisis. Senator Schumer also successfully called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reverse its original guidance and streamline these direct payments to Social Security recipients, ensuring that seniors and other vulnerable New Yorkers would not have to take an additional, unnecessary step of filing tax returns in order to receive this assistance.
$1.5 Billion In Testing Funding For New York State: In May, Senator Schumer announced that New York state received $1.5 billion out of a $10.25 billion national pot for coronavirus (COVID-19) testing he proposed and fought to secure as a lead negotiator in the 'Corona 3.5' legislation. Specifically, New York State received $700,248,982 and New York City received $807,512,729 that can be used for COVID-19 testing purposes, including for testing equipment and supplies, contract tracing and surveillance, personal protective equipment and more.
Secured $7 Billion In Loans For New York Hospitals And Providers: In addition to the grant money he secured, Senator Schumer secured roughly $7 billion in loans for New York hospitals and health care providers. This additional cash flow provided a lifeline to those providers as they weathered caring for Covid-19 patients and major revenue losses from shutting down as many of their services as possible. Schumer subsequently re-negotiated the repayment terms for these loans to make them far more favorable to New York providers, ensuring that they had all the resources they needed to combat the pandemic.
Expanded SNAP Benefits, Secured An Additional $162 Million In Funding For Child Care, Continued Nutrition For Seniors, And Delivered Nearly $1 Billion To Help Heat Homes When Income Becomes A Problem
Secured $2.15B For K-12 Schools And Institutions Of Higher Education Across New York: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought and secured $1 billion for K-12 schools through the Education Stabilization Fund, $164 million under the Governor's Emergency Education fund, and over $900 million for institutions of Higher Education. This pandemic relief helped support the education sector as it worked to meet the educational needs of students across the state.
Secured Nation's First Major Disaster Declaration for COVID-19, Unlocking Almost $6 billion In Federal FEMA Support for New York State: Following Schumer's tireless advocacy and early calls for broad federal support from FEMA, New York State was granted the first Major Disaster Declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic of any state in the country. Schumer has continued to push the Administrator and the President to provide all support available to New York under FEMA's control, delivering almost $6 billion for the state thus far, with over $1 billion in reimbursement for COVID-19 costs incurred by the state, localities, and eligible non-profits, like purchasing personal protective equipment and paying health care workers overtime.
Secured Over $6 Billion In FMAP Funds For NYS And Its Counties To Provide Vital Budget And Health Care Relief: Senator Schumer successfully pushed for Congress to include a cost-sharing provision in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act so New York's counties, which pay part of Medicaid's costs, could benefit from the increase federal Medicaid support. Schumer had successfully championed this provision in prior disaster response legislation, including after 9-11, Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 financial meltdown. The legislation immediately unlocked over $6 billion in state-wide dollars related to healthcare funds known as 'FMAP' for New York state and its counties to cover healthcare costs, $1 billion in unemployment benefits, free testing, pair emergency leave, meals for homebound seniors, and other critical services.
Fighting Hunger By Securing Pandemic-EBT Program Extension through September 2021 : After tirelessly advocating for expanded nutrition benefits, Senator Schumer secured numerous nutrition benefits in the negotiations for the Continuing Resolution. The Continuing Resolution extended P-EBT benefits through September 30, 2021 and creates a pathway to allow territories to participate in the P-EBT program. Roughly 2.1 million students across New York State are eligible for the P-EBT program, which provides families with additional nutrition assistance for students when schools are closed or in virtual learning.
Boosted NYS Hemp Growers and Producers To Create Jobs : Senator Schumer called on USDA to delay the implementation of the USDA's U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program final rule and urged USDA to respond to the numerous concerns of hemp growers and producers in Upstate NY. The senator worked closely with the House of Representatives to include language in the Continuing Resolution that extends the authorization for the 2014 hemp pilot program regulations through September 30, 2021, which will give New York hemp farmers additional time to come into compliance with USDA's new regulations for hemp.
Secured Over $409 Million for NYS Farmers : Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Senator Schumer has pushed USDA to expand the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to include as many commodities as possible and ensure New York State farmers receive the assistance they need. Senator Schumer lobbied USDA to include more specialty crops, small livestock, goats, microgreens, nursery and greenhouse commodities, nontraditional crops, and more on the list of eligible crops for CFAP. Following his efforts, USDA expanded the eligibility lists for CFAP 1 and rolled out a second CFAP program, CFAP 2, which included a significantly expanded list of eligible crops. To date, New York farmers have received over $222 million in assistance through the CFAP 1 program and $187 million through CFAP 2.
Secured A Major Disaster Declaration And Disaster Funding After Tropical Storm Isaias And Demanded Answers From Electricity CEOs: After Tropical Storm Isaias ripped through the Hudson Valley, New York City, and Long Island, Senator Schumer personally called the CEOs of Con Edison, Central Hudson, and PSEG to demand answers for why New Yorkers were left without power for days following inadequate communication. Schumer also sent a letter to the President urging him to declare this a major disaster and unlock millions in federal funds for the impacted region. After receiving this letter, the President granted the declaration for the 7 worst hit counties.
Called on TSA to Keep Agency Secure by Eliminating Its Use of TikTok : Citing concerns about communicating with the public via TikTok, Schumer called on the Transit Security Administration to reconsider its use of the platform and consult with the Department of Homeland Security, given laws that compel Chinese companies like partially China-owned TikTok to share data with the Chinese Communist Party. After raising the alarm, TSA discontinued its use of the social media platform.
NYC
Awarding Of Construction Contract On The Jamaica Armory Project After Senator Schumer Secured $91 Million In Funding: A construction contract has been awarded to further make progress on the Jamaica Armory project for both a 41,000 square foot addition to the readiness center and the restoration of the 140,000 square foot facility to support the center's training, administrative, and logistical needs. The modernization of the Jamaica armory will create jobs and act as an anchor to the Southeast Queens community, the National Guard, and all of New York City.
Established PPP Set-Asides For Lending To Underserved Small Businesses And Communities Of Color: After the enactment of the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought to provide more focused relief to the most underserved small businesses, which are often located in communities of color. As part of the subsequent COVID 3.5 bill the ""Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act"" Schumer negotiated a $60 billion PPP set-aside for small and mid-sized community lenders, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and microloan funds. After that bill passed, Schumer sent letters and placed calls to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, calling on him to create an even more narrowly focused set-aside for CDFIs and MDIs. In May, Secretary Mnuchin and the Small Business Administration heeded the calls of Sen. Schumer by announcing they would set aside $10 billion exclusively for PPP lending through CDFIs.
Delivered Billions in Aid To Save Our Subways, Busses and MTA; Delivered Two Financial Lifelines To The MTA As Ridership Levels Plummeted: As ridership levels on the Metropolitan Transit Authority's network of subways, buses, and commuter rails dropped to historic lows due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, Senator Schumer prevailed in the face of Republican intransigence to secure nearly $4 billion to stop the fiscal bleeding at the nation's largest public transit network. These funds stabilized the MTA's finances as it undertook an historic subway car cleaning program and other safety measures to keep the system running through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, Sen. Schumer successfully secured access to the Federal Reserve's Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) for the MTA and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after he appealed directly to Fed Chairman Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. To date, the MTA has tapped the MLF for $450 billion in debt relief.
Delivered Urgent Aid To Parishes, Churches, Schools To Enable Then To Survive The COVID Lockdown: As a result of Schumer's efforts, nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business COVID relief. This relief enabled parishes, schools, churches, synagogues and more to remain solvent and survive the COVID lockdown.
Hosted Workshop With Local Faith-Based Community Organizations To Broaden Access To Nonprofit Security Funding Amid Troubling Increase In Hate Crimes, Leading To Largest Number of Grants Ever Awarded to NYC Area In Program History: Following his successful push for an historic 50 percent increase $30 million in Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) funding at the end of last year, Senator Schumer sent a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) calling for a series of workshops and webinars to assist New York-based religious institutions applying to strengthen their security preparedness against religiously motivated attacks like in Monsey. In February, Sen. Schumer's office co-hosted a workshop in Manhattan with Sen. Gillibrand's office, FEMA, DHSES, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and New York Police Department that brought together dozens of local churches, synagogues, mosques, parochial schools, and other faith-based community organizations to discuss the application process for NSGP. In July, DHS announced over $12 million in nonprofit security grants for 138 NYC area organizations, the greatest funding amount nationwide and the largest number of grants ever awarded to the NYC area in program history.

The legislation will require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and 50 clad coins in 2022, commemorating our nation's Purple Heart recipients. All proceeds from the sale of the coins will contribute to the Orange County-based National Purple Heart Honor Mission, located in New Windsor, New York.
Secured Over $3.2M For Economic Development In The Town Of Cortlandt Ahead Of Indian Point's Impending 2021 Closure: Senator Schumer locked in over $3.2 million in federal funds for the Town of Cortlandt to boost economic activity in the Lower Hudson Valley when the Indian Point nuclear power plant shuts down in April 2021. This funding comes from a new program housed by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) that Schumer helped create to assist communities, like those surrounding Indian Point, offset the devastating economic impacts of a closing nuclear power plant.
NORTH COUNTRY
Secured $9 Million In DoD Funding For Watertown YMCA Community Center, Boosting Downtown Watertown, Fort Drum, And Regional Economy: After continued engagement with the DoD and a personal call with former Defense Secretary Esper, Senator Schumer successfully secured a $9 Million DoD grant to support the Watertown YMCA community center. The funding enables a project that will provide year-round community space for Fort Drum's military families in addition to bolstering downtown Watertown. The completed community center will have a six-lane lap pool, a separate full-size recreational pool, three exercise rooms, and arts/multipurpose room, two indoor tennis courts, and a community kitchen.
Ensured Funding To Deepen The Port Of Ogdensburg Remained Locked-In Place After Project Delay: In 2017, Senator Schumer secured funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to deepen the Ogdensburg Harbor and create new economic opportunities for the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority (OBPA). However the federal funds were in jeopardy as the project was delayed while OBPA sought additional funds to complete the project. In 2020, Senator Schumer worked with USACE keep the federal funding in place while OBPA successfully secured additional funding. The long-delayed project will finally begin this year and lead to increased commerce at the Port of Ogdensburg.
Secured Over $4 Million For Economic Development Projects Across The Northern Border: Senator Schumer secured $4,499,626 in federal funding for eight projects aimed at improving the economy in Northern New York. The funding was allocated through the Northern Border Regional Commission's (NBRC) Economic and Infrastructure Development Investment Program to support infrastructure projects and other initiatives that create jobs, support infrastructure, and strengthen the economy in the city of Troy Warren, Washington, Sullivan, St. Lawrence, and Herkimer Counties, Tupper Lake, Town of Essex, and North Country Community College.
LONG ISLAND
Delivered Historic $2.6 Billion Federal Investment To Construct World First Electron Ion Collider At Brookhaven National Lab On Long Island: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine that would allow scientists to look inside the building blocks of an atom. In 2018 Senator Schumer, a long time benefactor of BNL, urged the Department of Energy to construct a U.S.-based EIC after a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine published a report urging immediate action to advance fundamental research into nuclear physics as a national security interest. Sen. Schumer spearheaded Congressional commitment to advancing scientific research by using his role as Democratic Leader to ensure that DOE had enough funding to advance the construction of an EIC to the solicitation phase. DOE issued a request for proposals for construction of the EIC triggering a competition between BNL and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Senator Schumer successfully made the case to DOE that BNL's track record in constructing large user facilities of national significance like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) made them the ideal choice for the EIC. In early 2020, DOE announced that it had chosen BNL's proposal and would begin the process of providing funds to BNL beginning the design phase of this $2.6 billion atom smasher.
Steered Course Correction By U.S. Navy To Proactively Clean Up The Toxic Grumman Plume; Secured Navy Commitment To Finally Intercept Ever Expanding Plume After 20 Year Fight: The Navy-Grumman Plume is a 3,000+ acre mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emanating from the former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) and Grumman facilities in Bethpage which specialized in aviation, weapons and space exploration manufacturing from the 1930s to 1998. Schumer long championed the position that the state and the Navy should be working to ""hydraulically contain"" and remove the ever expanding plume from Long Island's sole source aquifer rather than focusing on its practice of ""wellhead treatment"" which addressed the problem on the surface but ignored the swiftly metastasizing chemicals underneath. For twenty years Senator Schumer advanced the ball by pushing the United States Geological Survey and later, the Navy to fully map the plume through federal legislation. With this new data secured by Senator Schumer, state health regulators realized that containment was possible and began working on a plan to contain the plume. At first recalcitrant, after Schumer's urging, the Navy began to work with the state on a plan to try to contain the ever expanding plume. In late 2020, Navy announced that they had developed a plan to intercept migrating plume, Navy would construct extraction wells along the Southern State Parkway to intercept plume before it reaches south shore communities like Massapequa and the Great South Bay.
Landed Department Of Energy National Center For Quantum Information Science At Brookhaven National Lab, Part Of $625 Million Federal Commitment To Quantum Science: Senator Schumer worked tirelessly in Congress to pass The National Quantum Initiative Act which directed the DOE to establish at least three national centers for the purpose of advancing the United States' knowledge in the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS). In 2019, after passage of the act, Schumer worked directly with the DOE Secretary to ensure Congress adequately funded DOE to swiftly establish the National QIS Centers while simultaneously urging him to consider BNL as one of the three sites based off of their achievements in advancing our knowledge of QIS. In early 2020, DOE announced up to $625 million over five years to fund five Quantum Research Centers including the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Labs.
Sounded The Alarm On Vital Equipment Taken Off Fire Island Post-Sandy Project And Moved To Project One-Mile From Mar-A-Lago: Schumer has long-fought for federal funding to shore up costal storm protections for communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy, including the Fire Island and Moriches Inlet project off of Long Island. Part-way through the construction work to replenish beaches this year and protect residents from future storm threats, the vitally needed dredging equipmentone of just a handful off the Atlantic Coastwas pulled off the project to complete another beach dredging project at Midtown Beach in Palm Beach County, Floridaa beach that already has a sea wall and sits just a mile from Mar-A-Lagobefore turtle nesting season. Schumer called for an explanation of the decision and commitment that the dredging ship would return to Long Island on time to complete its New York work. After sounding the alarm and staying on top of the Army Corps in subsequent months, the dredge was returned to Long Island on time to resume its emergency coastal protection work.

Facing a worrying spike in coronavirus cases in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, New York City health officials began carrying out emergency inspections at private religious schools on Friday and threatened to impose an extraordinary lockdown in those communities that would be the first major retreat by the city on reopening since the pandemic began. 
 Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the Police Department and the Sheriff's Office to enforce public health guidelines in several Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, where residents often do not wear masks or engage in social distancing. But community leaders said residents have been resisting the guidelines because of hostility toward Mr. de Blasio and the growing influence of President Trump, whose views on masks and the pandemic have been widely embraced.
 The crackdown is occurring shortly before Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, which begins on Sunday night, and it was not immediately clear the impact that the measures might have on the ability of people to gather in synagogues. The Health Department said that if significant progress toward following guidelines did not occur by Monday, officials could issue fines, limit gatherings or force closings of businesses or schools.
 ''This may be the most precarious moment we are facing since we emerged from lockdown,'' Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, the city's health commissioner, said at a news conference in South Brooklyn.
 Officials this week released statistics showing that the positivity rate in some Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods had grown to anywhere from 3 percent to 6 percent, significantly more than the city's overall rate of between 1 percent and 2 percent. Officials are especially worried about the positivity rates in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Borough Park, Midwood and Gravesend, which they have referred to as the ''Ocean Parkway Cluster.''
 Mr. de Blasio said on Friday on The Brian Lehrer Show that the city had closed four yeshivas over violations of social distancing rules. 
 ''There's a very rigorous outreach effort in the community in English and Yiddish,'' the mayor said, adding, ''There's a substantial number of Yiddish speakers who have been brought into the effort. Test and Trace has been hiring directly from the community. We are going to keep doing that, though. I think this is an indicator we will be fighting for a little while here.''
 The uptick in these neighborhoods amounts to the first major coronavirus challenge for the city after months of declining or flat infection rates. The concern now is that if the outbreak spreads further in the Orthodox community, it could begin to take hold elsewhere, with even more serious consequences. If the city's overall positivity rate hits 3 percent, that would trigger a new lockdown, including the closing of public schools.
 ''In the absence of our doing the right thing, we will need to be in a lockdown-type situation as occurred in Israel,'' Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of New York City Health and Hospitals, which is overseeing the city's contact tracing program said earlier this week. He was referring to the decision by the Israeli government to reinstitute restrictions because the country is facing the highest rate of new cases per capita in the world.
 The distrust of the authorities was on display during Friday's news conference in South Brooklyn, at Gravesend Park, which was attended by several city health officials, when one man interrupted Dr. Katz by loudly saying the city had been exaggerating the severity of the outbreak. 
 The scene grew tense when a second man, who was not wearing a mask, approached Dr. Katz, who told him to back off or put on a mask. The man shouted that he wouldn't wear a mask and anyone who didn't like it could leave.
 ''You don't live here,'' he shouted. ''Get out of here.''
 The man, who wouldn't give his name, soon shouted a racial slur. He also began yelling, ''Go to East New York,'' a predominately Black neighborhood in Brooklyn.
 Visits to Borough Park showed how the rules are often ignored. The coronavirus outbreak devastated New York's Orthodox Jewish community in March and April, and community leaders say hundreds have died, including influential religious leaders. But this week, there was hardly a face mask in sight, as if the pandemic had never happened.
 At a flower stand in Borough Park on Friday, a vendor, Boris Mushayev, tended to his merchandise as customers around him, all without masks, perused the white, red and orange blooms.
 ''You have some people here who wear masks but it is true that most people do not,'' said Mr. Mushayev. ''I think some people are just not so worried about the virus anymore. If customers want me to wear a mask I wear it, but for now I have to focus on work.''
 Borough Park and Midwood were islands of support for President Trump during the 2016 election, when the president won 89 percent of the vote in one local precinct. Many there view him as an ally on issues like school choice, religious freedom and support for Israel, said Avi Greenstein, chief executive of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council.
 Those political cross currents had made many here susceptible to ''conflicting information from Washington, where we see a constant downplaying of the crisis and indoor rallies where people may or not be wearing masks,'' Mr. Greenstein said.
 He added that the political rift had been deepened by what he said were the de Blasio administration's failures.
 ''For the city to make this deadline on the evening of Yom Kippur is shocking, and what is worse is community leaders found out about this on Thursday night from a press release,'' said Mr. Greenstein. ''That tells you everything you need to know about the story of Borough Park during the pandemic.''
 Mr. Greenstein contrasted the mayor's approach with a visit to his community center's offices in January by Attorney General William P. Barr, who used the appearance at the venue to announce federal hate-crime charges against a Brooklyn woman accused of assaulting three Orthodox women last December.
 ''That sent a message to the community, to the entire neighborhood, very loud and clear: We're here, we're working with you,'' he said. But when it comes to the coronavirus, he added, the neighborhood was facing a crisis of ''tremendous uncertainty, a tremendous amount of misinformation and a lack of information.''
 Yosef Rapaport, 66, a Yiddish podcaster whose brother and brother-in-law both died of Covid-19, said Mr. de Blasio needed to rebuild trust with a religious minority that has largely spurned his administration and aligned with President Trump.
 ''This community is being hit by a double whammy: the incompetence of City Hall and the ugliness that is coming from Washington,'' Mr. Rapaport said. ''There is a deep, deep mistrust among the community for the intentions of the mayor, especially when the president takes a different approach.''
 Dr. Katz defended the city's efforts, saying that it had made over 200,000 public health robocalls to neighborhoods with significant Orthodox Jewish populations and distributed tens of thousands of masks in Borough Park, Williamsburg, Brighton Beach and Flushing.
 The city has also placed ''nearly 60 newspaper ads in community papers to get the word out'' among Hasidic Jews, he said, and talked to 20 synagogue leaders in Borough Park, a neighborhood with about 300 synagogues, according to Mr. Greenstein.
 One lingering issue in the city's relationship with Hasidic New Yorkers has been a late-night Twitter outburst by the mayor after he personally oversaw the dispersal of a rabbi's funeral in Williamsburg in April. For many, it validated their fears about the city's leadership.
 Jacob Kornbluh, a Hasidic Jew who lives in Borough Park and writes for Jewish Insider, a national publication, summed up a perspective he often hears in the neighborhood: ''De Blasio became the guy singling out the Jews so we don't have to listen to him anymore.''
 He added that when Mr. de Blasio failed to respond similarly to Black Lives Matter protests in June, it deepened people's sense that the government was singling them out.
 ''Trump speaks their language: distrust in his own government that he leads, distrust in the media,'' Mr. Kornbluh said.

Far-right extremists have been in the news, with an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan's governor and rallies like the one the Proud Boys held in Portland in September.With a hotly contested election underway in a polarized society, many people are concerned about violence from far-right extremists . But they may not understand the real threat. The law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged the extent of the threat . But it's not clear how long their attention will last.While researching my forthcoming book, ' It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the U.S. ,' I discovered that there are five key mistakes people make when thinking about far-right extremists. These mistakes obscure the extremists' true danger.
In this Jan. 18, 1986, photo, a KKK group marches in Tennessee to protest the first national observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. AP Photo/Mark Humphrey 1. Some have white supremacist views, but others don'tWhen asked to condemn white supremacists and extremists at the first presidential debate , President Donald Trump floundered, then said, 'Give me a name.' His Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered, ' The Proud Boys .'Not all far-right extremists are militant white supremacists.White supremacy, the belief in white racial superiority and dominance, is a major theme of many far-right believers. Some, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, are extremely hardcore hate groups .Others, who at times identify themselves with the term ' alt-right ,' often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the ' alt-lite ,' like the Proud Boys , who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants.There is another major category of far-right extremists who focus more on opposing the government than they do on racial differences. This so-called 'patriot movement' includes tax protesters and militias , many heavily armed and a portion from military and law enforcement backgrounds. Some, like the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Boogaloos , seek civil war to overthrow what they regard as a corrupt political order.

They live in cities and towns across the nation and even the globeFar-right extremists are in communities all across America.The KKK , often thought of as centered in the South , has chapters from coast to coast. The same is true of other far-right extremist groups, as illustrated by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Map .Far-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack , both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist ' white genocide .' The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert about the 'growing and increasing transnational threat' of right-wing extremism.
The 'collective delusion' known as QAnon will be around for many years. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren 3. Many are well-organized, educated and social-media savvyFar-right extremists include people who write books, wear sport coats and have advanced degrees. For instance, in 1978 a physics professor turned neo-Nazi wrote a book that has been called the ' bible of the racist right .' Other leaders of the movement have attended elite universities .Far-right extremists were early users of the internet and now thrive on social media platforms, which they use to agitate, recruit and organize. The 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville revealed how effectively they could reach large groups and mobilize them into action.Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have recently attempted to ban many of them. But the alleged Michigan kidnappers' ability to evade restrictions by simply creating new pages and groups has limited the companies' success .
People carrying a Nazi flag march in New York City in 1937. New York World-Telegram and the Sun Newspaper Photograph Collection/Library of Congress 4. They were here long before Trump and will remain here long afterMany people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes , anti-Semitism and the number of hate groups have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement - called both a ' collective delusion ' and a ' virtual cult ' - has gained widespread attention.But far-right extremists were here long before Trump.The history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK . In the 1920s, the KKK had millions of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed ' Silver Shirts ' and a 20,000 person pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939.While adapting to the times, far-right extremism has continued into the present. It's not dependent on Trump, and will remain a threat regardless of his public prominence.
Members of the Boogaloo movement, seen here at a New Hampshire demonstration, seek a civil war in the U.S. AP Photo/Michael Dwyer 5. They pose a widespread and dire threat, with some seeking civil warFar-right extremists often appear to strike in spectacular 'lone wolf' attacks, like the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995 , the mass murder at a Charleston church in 2015 and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018. But these people are not alone.Most far-right extremists are part of larger extremist communities , communicating by social media and distributing posts and manifestos .Their messages speak of fear that one day, whites may be outnumbered by nonwhites in the U.S., and the idea that there is a Jewish-led plot to destroy the white race . In response, they prepare for a war between whites and nonwhites.[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation's newsletter .]Thinking of these extremists as loners risks missing the complexity of their networks , which brought as many as 13 alleged plotters together in the planning to kidnap Michigan's governor.Together, these misconceptions about far-right extremist individuals and groups can lead Americans to underestimate the dire threat they pose to the public . Understanding them, by contrast, can help people and experts alike address the danger , as the election - and its aftermath - unfolds.

but also in line with what many businesses are doing this month, which is to express our concerns about the failure of Facebook to take down some hateful material from their platforms and to take more responsibility for the lies and propaganda that is sometimes put out there on Facebook. Facebook need to do more to take responsibility and this is just one way that businesses, the Labour Party and others can put pressure on Facebook to do the right thing and to take tougher action on hate crime and hate speech. Some good clear answers. Rachel Reeves, thank you very much for talking to us this morning. 
Scotland's approach to Covid-19 has been a bit tougher than England's. Compulsory face masks in shops first, and a slightly slower unlocking. No deaths at all from the disease in Scotland in the last few days as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's elimination strategy continues. But it hasn't been without controversy about quarantining Scots who have been on holiday in Spain, and with a poor record in care homes. Nicola Sturgeon joins me now from Glasgow. Nicola Sturgeon, welcome. You have said that the rate of infections of coronavirus in England is now five times worse than Scotland where you are pursuing an elimination strategy. And yet you are not yet pressing the button on making people from England coming into Scotland quarantine. Why not? I have said we will keep all of these things under review. I set out in Parliament just on Thursday that one of our biggest risks over the next few weeks is we have driven levels of the virus to very low levels in Scotland, is the risk of importation into the country. That's why we have taken a very cautious decision about international quarantine, and this is not a position I relish being in, it also means that we have to take a very close look at making sure that we are not seeing the virus come in from other parts of the UK. That's not political, it is not constitutional, it is just taking a similar view to countries across the world in terms of protecting populations from the risk of the virus. It is not something we have decided to do at this stage and not something I'm immediately planning to do but I will take decisions the best I can to protect the health of Scotland and to take that absolutely from a public health perspective. What are you looking at in a public health perspective? Are you waiting to see if there is a further increase in infection levels in England? And if that's the case, and you decide to ask people from England coming into Scotland to quarantine, how do you do that practically? Well, look, don't focus all of this discussion on quarantine. One of the things that I think we must do in the immediate term, and I took part in a meeting, telephone meeting with Michael Gove and the other First Minister's earlier last week, and we need to work together on outbreak management. We recently had a cross-border outbreak. We think it started in Carlisle but spreading to Dumfries and Galloway so we worked together to make sure the right restrictions were in place. Fundamentally this is about where there are outbreaks, as there is in Leicester right now, the right outbreak management being put in place and that then mitigates against having to put any border restrictions in place. So we need to look at these things very carefully and we need to be driven entirely by public health considerations. We saw some of your more enthusiastic supporters recently trying to stop cars at the border and turn them back. That's the kind of thing, from your tone, that you absolutely don't want to happen again. Absolutely not. This is not about saying to people in England they are not welcome in Scotland, of course people in England are welcome in Scotland, lots of people in England live in Scotland and vice versa, this is not about politics or a constitutional agenda, it's just about taking decisions that try and protect people in Scotland as much as possible from Covid, just as the UK Government I'm sure wants to do everything it can to protect the population in England. If you look at the situation in Australia, you can't travel from Melbourne to Sydney because of the spike in cases in Melbourne. The Governor of New York has restricted travel from some of the worst affected states in America into New York. Leaders across the world are taking these very objective public health driven decisions, and I'm determined to do likewise. You have just made the case very strongly therefore quarantining people from England coming into Scotland. What would need to change? One of your own advisers Professor Devi Sridhar from Edinburgh University said many people cross the border every day and I think we will never get to full elimination of coronavirus without England's cooperation. I'd like to see the UK Government be more explicit that it was trying to get to levels of coronavirus that was virtually elimination levels but that is a decision for the Prime Minister and the UK Government to take. These are not decisions I will take lightly but they are not"

Announced during AJC's Global Forum in 2019, the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations was created to address the urgent need to bring together the Black and Jewish communities.
The Caucus was established by Reps. Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), Will Hurd (R-TX), Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL), Lee Zeldin (R-NY), and the late John Lewis (D-GA) to raise awareness of each community's sensitivities and needs in Congress and around the country and to provide resources to members of Congress to empower them to bring Black and Jewish communities together, combating stereotypes and hate and showcasing commonalities.
The Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations has 55 members. The Caucus consists of Blacks and Jews, Democrats and Republicans.
Since its founding in June of 2019, the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations has brought both communities together to advocate for priority legislation in a plethora of ways:
Amid rising antisemitism in the U.S. and abroad, the Caucus joined AJC's #JewishandProud Day viral social media campaign in January 2020 to show support for America's Jewish community after a series of brazen antisemitic attacks in New York and New Jersey. Co-Chairs Brenda Lawrence (D-MI), Will Hurd (R-TX), and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL) posted about their unwavering support.
In May 2020, the Caucus announced it would combat antisemitism and all forms of racism by advocating for passage of the NO HATE Act, stating that, ""Hate crimes will continue to spread if left unaddressed. For our country to thrive during this turbulent time, each of our communities must not only feel safe but know that their concerns are counted on a national scale."" According to the FBI, Jews have long been the group most targeted by religiously-motivated hate crimes, while Black Americans are by far the most targeted for racially-motivated crimes.
After the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, the Caucus convened a roundtable of a select group of Black and Jewish organizations, including AJC, to discuss policy recommendations to combat racism in the U.S. A full version of AJC's statement and policies presented to the Caucus can be found here.
On July 18, 2020, the members of the Caucus mourned the passing of civil rights icon and Caucus founding Co-Chair, Rep. John Lewis. In an emotional statement, fellow Co-Chairs expressed their admiration for their colleague, noting that ""his belief in the power of Blacks and Jews to affect change together, to advocate for each other and stomp out all bigotry, was integral to the formation of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations."" You can also watch members honoring the life and legacy of Rep. Lewis during an AJC Advocacy Anywhere program.
Leaders of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations and the Congressional Black Caucus will soon introduce a resolution that celebrates Black-Jewish relations to bolster mutual understanding and recognize the joint need to combat antisemitism and racism.
Want to learn more about the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations? This interview with Rep. Lawrence has everything you need to know about the creation and thinking behind this important initiative. You can also listen to this episode of AJC's People of the Pod podcast, recorded in January 2020 ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with Caucus founders Reps. Lawrence, Wasserman-Schultz, and Zeldin."

That's why we have taken a very cautious decision about international quarantine, and this is not a position I relish being in, it also means that we have to take a very close look at making sure that we are not seeing the virus come in from other parts of the UK. That's not political, it is not constitutional, it is just taking a similar view to countries across the world in terms of protecting populations from the risk of the virus. It is not something we have decided to do at this stage and not something I'm immediately planning to do but I will take decisions the best I can to protect the health of Scotland and to take that absolutely from a public health perspective. What are you looking at in a public health perspective? Are you waiting to see if there is a further increase in infection levels in England? And if that's the case, and you decide to ask people from England coming into Scotland to quarantine, how do you do that practically? Well, look, don't focus all of this discussion on quarantine. One of the things that I think we must do in the immediate term, and I took part in a meeting, telephone meeting with Michael Gove and the other First Minister's earlier last week, and we need to work together on outbreak management. We recently had a cross-border outbreak. We think it started in Carlisle but spreading to Dumfries and Galloway so we worked together to make sure the right restrictions were in place. Fundamentally this is about where there are outbreaks, as there is in Leicester right now, the right outbreak management being put in place and that then mitigates against having to put any border restrictions in place. So we need to look at these things very carefully and we need to be driven entirely by public health considerations. We saw some of your more enthusiastic supporters recently trying to stop cars at the border and turn them back. That's the kind of thing, from your tone, that you absolutely don't want to happen again. Absolutely not. This is not about saying to people in England they are not welcome in Scotland, of course people in England are welcome in Scotland, lots of people in England live in Scotland and vice versa, this is not about politics or a constitutional agenda, it's just about taking decisions that try and protect people in Scotland as much as possible from Covid, just as the UK Government I'm sure wants to do everything it can to protect the population in England. If you look at the situation in Australia, you can't travel from Melbourne to Sydney because of the spike in cases in Melbourne. The Governor of New York has restricted travel from some of the worst affected states in America into New York. Leaders across the world are taking these very objective public health driven decisions, and I'm determined to do likewise. You have just made the case very strongly therefore quarantining people from England coming into Scotland. What would need to change? One of your own advisers Professor Devi Sridhar from Edinburgh University said many people cross the border every day and I think we will never get to full elimination of coronavirus without England's cooperation. I'd like to see the UK Government be more explicit that it was trying to get to levels of coronavirus that was virtually elimination levels but that is a decision for the Prime Minister and the UK Government to take. These are not decisions I will"

The police do need to be defunded, more specifically they need to have some of their operations curtailed, and the best way to do this is to cut their budgets. Also, they need to be held to account every time they abuse their power. 
There are signs this is happening with the recent Executive Order by Donald Trump. It may be this will be the real legacy of George Floyd[1], a man who would otherwise have been remembered for crimes of violence and a life wasted by drug abuse, if he had been remembered at all. So what aspects of policing can be defunded? How about no-knock warrants? This is more a matter of reform than defunding. SWAT teams will still be needed for genuine emergencies, but there have been far too many raids in which innocent people have been killed. A no-knock raid is really suitable only in a life or death situation, and how many of those are there that are not terrorist-related? In New York City, plainclothes squads interacting with the public have already been reassigned. New York is the old stomping ground of Dan Bongino[2], and he has made it clear he isn't happy with this. Sad thing, isn't it Dan, no more agents provocateurs, no more 'controlled' drug buys? How about disbanding the vice squad too, like throughout the nation? In recent years we have heard a lot about sex trafficking. This is the new narrative of the anti-prostitution lobby[3]; don't be fooled by the claim that countless numbers of young women and underage girls are being 'trafficked' across the Western world. Far better to legalise this sordid trade so women can be protected from not only violent clients but corrupt police officers, like Daniel Holtzclaw[4]. In England, while prostitution isn't illegal, keeping a brothel is. So all it would take is a slight tweak in the law to enable two or more prostitutes to work together from an apartment, taking them off the street and increasing their safety. Again, in the UK and increasingly other countries, especially France and Canada, pressure by feminist and powerful political lobbies has led to the creation of all manner of offences which are not really crimes. In the UK, the police seem to spend more time monitoring Twitter and other social media in case somebody says something offensive than pounding the beat. At least one police force has announced it will treat misogyny as a 'hate crime'. Whistling at an attractive woman in the street is a crime? Police everywhere like easy targets, which is why they are often so eager to engage with motorists over the most trivial of incidents or non-incidents as pointed out here[5]. But it isn't only the police who need to be reined in, it is over-zealous, corrupt and at times simply dumb prosecutors. The witch-hunt of Donald Trump supporters saw the FBI attempting to entrap people for imaginary crimes[6], and charging them with lying to federal officers if they misremembered the date of an inconsequential meeting. Innocent defendants are bludgeoned into pleading guilty by being threatened with Draconian sentences should they proceed to trial and be convicted. The whole system needs serious reform, and state agents who abuse the process for whatever reason need to be held to account. Slashing their budgets to make them concentrate on real crimes is a long overdue first step in that direction. Article Rating Liked it?

Scotland's approach to Covid-19 has been a bit tougher than England's. Compulsory face masks in shops first, and a slightly slower unlocking.

Link to Story
Far-right extremists have been in the news, with an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan's governor and rallies like the one the Proud Boys held in Portland in September.
With a hotly contested election underway in a polarized society, many people are concerned about violence from far-right extremists . But they may not understand the real threat.
The law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged the extent of the threat . But it's not clear how long their attention will last.
While researching my forthcoming book, ' It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the U.S. ,' I discovered that there are five key mistakes people make when thinking about far-right extremists. These mistakes obscure the extremists' true danger.
In this Jan. 18, 1986, photo, a KKK group marches in Tennessee to protest the first national observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. AP Photo/Mark Humphrey 1. Some have white supremacist views, but others don'tWhen asked to condemn white supremacists and extremists at the first presidential debate , President Donald Trump floundered, then said, 'Give me a name.' His Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered, ' The Proud Boys .'
Not all far-right extremists are militant white supremacists.
White supremacy, the belief in white racial superiority and dominance, is a major theme of many far-right believers. Some, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, are extremely hardcore hate groups .
Others, who at times identify themselves with the term ' alt-right ,' often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the ' alt-lite ,' like the Proud Boys , who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants.
There is another major category of far-right extremists who focus more on opposing the government than they do on racial differences. This so-called 'patriot movement' includes tax protesters and militias , many heavily armed and a portion from military and law enforcement backgrounds. Some, like the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Boogaloos , seek civil war to overthrow what they regard as a corrupt political order.

The KKK , often thought of as centered in the South , has chapters from coast to coast. The same is true of other far-right extremist groups, as illustrated by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Map .
Far-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack , both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist ' white genocide .' The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert about the 'growing and increasing transnational threat' of right-wing extremism.
The 'collective delusion' known as QAnon will be around for many years. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren 3. Many are well-organized, educated and social-media savvyFar-right extremists include people who write books, wear sport coats and have advanced degrees. For instance, in 1978 a physics professor turned neo-Nazi wrote a book that has been called the ' bible of the racist right .' Other leaders of the movement have attended elite universities .
Far-right extremists were early users of the internet and now thrive on social media platforms, which they use to agitate, recruit and organize. The 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville revealed how effectively they could reach large groups and mobilize them into action.
Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have recently attempted to ban many of them. But the alleged Michigan kidnappers' ability to evade restrictions by simply creating new pages and groups has limited the companies' success .
People carrying a Nazi flag march in New York City in 1937. New York World-Telegram and the Sun Newspaper Photograph Collection/Library of Congress 4. They were here long before Trump and will remain here long afterMany people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes , anti-Semitism and the number of hate groups have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement - called both a ' collective delusion ' and a ' virtual cult ' - has gained widespread attention.
But far-right extremists were here long before Trump.
The history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK . In the 1920s, the KKK had millions of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed ' Silver Shirts ' and a 20,000 person pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939.
While adapting to the times, far-right extremism has continued into the present. It's not dependent on Trump, and will remain a threat regardless of his public prominence.
Members of the Boogaloo movement, seen here at a New Hampshire demonstration, seek a civil war in the U.S. AP Photo/Michael Dwyer 5. They pose a widespread and dire threat, with some seeking civil warFar-right extremists often appear to strike in spectacular 'lone wolf' attacks, like the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995 , the mass murder at a Charleston church in 2015 and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018. But these people are not alone.
Most far-right extremists are part of larger extremist communities , communicating by social media and distributing posts and manifestos .
Their messages speak of fear that one day, whites may be outnumbered by nonwhites in the U.S., and the idea that there is a Jewish-led plot to destroy the white race . In response, they prepare for a war between whites and nonwhites.

Thinking of these extremists as loners risks missing the complexity of their networks , which brought as many as 13 alleged plotters together in the planning to kidnap Michigan's governor.
Together, these misconceptions about far-right extremist individuals and groups can lead Americans to underestimate the dire threat they pose to the public . Understanding them, by contrast, can help people and experts alike address the danger , as the election - and its aftermath - unfolds.

Scotland's approach to Covid-19 has been a bit tougher than England's. Compulsory face masks in shops first, and a slightly slower unlocking. No deaths at all from the disease in Scotland in the last few days as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's elimination strategy continues. But it hasn't been without controversy about quarantining Scots who have been on holiday in Spain, and with a poor record in care homes. Nicola Sturgeon joins me now from Glasgow. Nicola Sturgeon, welcome. You have said that the rate of infections of coronavirus in England is now five times worse than Scotland where you are pursuing an elimination strategy. And yet you are not yet pressing the button on making people from England coming into Scotland quarantine. Why not? I have said we will keep all of these things under review. I set out in Parliament just on Thursday that one of our biggest risks over the next few weeks is we have driven levels of the virus to very low levels in Scotland, is the risk of importation into the country. That's why we have taken a very cautious decision about international quarantine, and this is not a position I relish being in, it also means that we have to take a very close look at making sure that we are not seeing the virus come in from other parts of the UK. That's not political, it is not constitutional, it is just taking a similar view to countries across the world in terms of protecting populations from the risk of the virus. It is not something we have decided to do at this stage and not something I'm immediately planning to do but I will take decisions the best I can to protect the health of Scotland and to take that absolutely from a public health perspective. What are you looking at in a public health perspective? Are you waiting to see if there is a further increase in infection levels in England? And if that's the case, and you decide to ask people from England coming into Scotland to quarantine, how do you do that practically? Well, look, don't focus all of this discussion on quarantine. One of the things that I think we must do in the immediate term, and I took part in a meeting, telephone meeting with Michael Gove and the other First Minister's earlier last week, and we need to work together on outbreak management. We recently had a cross-border outbreak. We think it started in Carlisle but spreading to Dumfries and Galloway so we worked together to make sure the right restrictions were in place. Fundamentally this is about where there are outbreaks, as there is in Leicester right now, the right outbreak management being put in place and that then mitigates against having to put any border restrictions in place. So we need to look at these things very carefully and we need to be driven entirely by public health considerations. We saw some of your more enthusiastic supporters recently trying to stop cars at the border and turn them back. That's the kind of thing, from your tone, that you absolutely don't want to happen again. Absolutely not. This is not about saying to people in England they are not welcome in Scotland, of course people in England are welcome in Scotland, lots of people in England live in Scotland and vice versa, this is not about politics or a constitutional agenda, it's just about taking decisions that try and protect people in Scotland as much as possible from Covid, just as the UK Government I'm sure wants to do everything it can to protect the population in England. If you look at the situation in Australia, you can't travel from Melbourne to Sydney because of the spike in cases in Melbourne. The Governor of New York has restricted travel from some of the worst affected states in America into New York. Leaders across the world are taking these very objective public health driven decisions, and I'm determined to do likewise. You have just made the case very strongly therefore quarantining people from England coming into Scotland. What would need to change? One of your own advisers Professor Devi Sridhar from Edinburgh University said many people cross the border every day and I think we will never get to full elimination of coronavirus without England's cooperation. I'd like to see the UK Government be more explicit that it was trying to get to levels of coronavirus that was virtually elimination levels but that is a decision for the Prime Minister and the UK Government to take. These are not decisions I will"

Adriano Espaillat:
NEW YORK, NY Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) announced support of the Justice in Policing Act, led by members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), which would take key steps to achieve transformational, structural change to combat the pattern of police violence:
The Justice in Policing Act aims to remove barriers to prosecuting police misconduct and recovering damages from officers who have violated civilians' rights, including by ending qualified immunity by law enforcement; demilitarize the police by limiting the transfer of military weaponry to state and local police departments; combat police brutality, including by requiring body and dashboard cameras, banning chokeholds, ending the use of no-knock warrants in drug cases and enacting steps to end racial profiling; step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement; and, officially make lynching a federal hate crime, as the House did in passing H.R. 35 earlier this year.
""I am proud to stand in unity and solidarity with my Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) colleagues to demand justice and call for an end to the police brutality and targeting of African Americans around the nation,"" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). ""I have long fought for communities of color in my district and will continue my fight for African American and Latino families to ensure all persons are treated equally under the law. Now is the time for systemic and transformational reform of America's policing system, to transition away from a policing-first model. The best anti-crime policies are anti-poverty policies, and we must invest in our communities to foster opportunity. If we fail to act and implement real change, history will judge us by our inaction and failure to ensure life, liberty and justice for all persons in our nation.""
Last week, Rep. Espaillat announced the Harlem Manifesto, a series of legislative policies to urge for the end of police brutality and targeting of African Americans throughout the nation. Additionally, Espaillat introduced the Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act that would hold officers accountable in court for abuses committed under the color of the law, and create a new statute that would lower the mens rea bar from willful deprivation of rights to reckless deprivation of rights, thereby permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement officers liable for the deprivation of civil rights and liberties.
Espaillat legislative priorities he fought for and prioritized in his Harlem Manifesto that are included in CBC, House Democrats' Justice in Policing Act:
- Denial of Rights Prevention and Accountability Act - Congressman Espaillat introduced this bill, which changes the 18 U.S.C. Sec. 242 mens rea requirement from willfulness to recklessness, permitting prosecutors to successfully hold law enforcement accountable for the deprivation of civil rights and civil liberties.
- Eric Garner Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act - This bill prohibits and makes punishable the use of a chokehold or any maneuvers that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain.
- Ending Qualified Immunity Act - This bill explicitly states that the judicial theory of qualified immunity is not a defense to liability, ensuring that the courts can't let police officers off the hook for civil charges in cases constitutional violations.
- Police Exercising Absolute Care with Everyone (PEACE) Act - This bill changes the use of force standard for officers to require that force must be necessary, as a last resort, to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury, and no reasonable alternatives were available.
- Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act - This bill prohibits the Defense Department from transferring military weapons to state and local law enforcement agencies.
- Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act - This bill creates accreditation standards to ensure compliance with approved practices and transparency within the community.
- Police CAMERA Act - This bill requires all law enforcement officers to wear body cameras and prohibit the seizure of cell phones or other recording devices used to document police interactions without a person's consent or a warrant.

Far-right extremists have been in the news, with an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan's governor and rallies like the one the Proud Boys held in Portland in September.With a hotly contested election underway in a polarized society, many people are concerned about violence from far-right extremists . But they may not understand the real threat. The law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged the extent of the threat . But it's not clear how long their attention will last.While researching my forthcoming book, ' It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the U.S. ,' I discovered that there are five key mistakes people make when thinking about far-right extremists. These mistakes obscure the extremists' true danger.
In this Jan. 18, 1986, photo, a KKK group marches in Tennessee to protest the first national observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. AP Photo/Mark Humphrey 1. Some have white supremacist views, but others don'tWhen asked to condemn white supremacists and extremists at the first presidential debate , President Donald Trump floundered, then said, 'Give me a name.' His Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered, ' The Proud Boys .'Not all far-right extremists are militant white supremacists.White supremacy, the belief in white racial superiority and dominance, is a major theme of many far-right believers. Some, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, are extremely hardcore hate groups .Others, who at times identify themselves with the term ' alt-right ,' often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the ' alt-lite ,' like the Proud Boys , who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants.There is another major category of far-right extremists who focus more on opposing the government than they do on racial differences. This so-called 'patriot movement' includes tax protesters and militias , many heavily armed and a portion from military and law enforcement backgrounds. Some, like the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Boogaloos , seek civil war to overthrow what they regard as a corrupt political order.
During an April protest in Seattle, a boat flies the Gadsden AP Photo/Ted S. Warren 2. They live in cities and towns across the nation and even the globeFar-right extremists are in communities all across America.The KKK , often thought of as centered in the South , has chapters from coast to coast. The same is true of other far-right extremist groups, as illustrated by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Map .Far-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack , both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist ' white genocide .' The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert about the 'growing and increasing transnational threat' of right-wing extremism.
The 'collective delusion' known as QAnon will be around for many years. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren 3. Many are well-organized, educated and social-media savvyFar-right extremists include people who write books, wear sport coats and have advanced degrees. For instance, in 1978 a physics professor turned neo-Nazi wrote a book that has been called the ' bible of the racist right .' Other leaders of the movement have attended elite universities .Far-right extremists were early users of the internet and now thrive on social media platforms, which they use to agitate, recruit and organize. The 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville revealed how effectively they could reach large groups and mobilize them into action.Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have recently attempted to ban many of them. But the alleged Michigan kidnappers' ability to evade restrictions by simply creating new pages and groups has limited the companies' success .
People carrying a Nazi flag march in New York City in 1937. New York World-Telegram and the Sun Newspaper Photograph Collection/Library of Congress 4. They were here long before Trump and will remain here long afterMany people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes , anti-Semitism and the number of hate groups have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement - called both a ' collective delusion ' and a ' virtual cult ' - has gained widespread attention.But far-right extremists were here long before Trump.The history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK . In the 1920s, the KKK had millions of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed ' Silver Shirts ' and a 20,000 person pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939.While adapting to the times, far-right extremism has continued into the present.

I set out in Parliament just on Thursday that one of our biggest risks over the next few weeks is we have driven levels of the virus to very low levels in Scotland, is the risk of importation into the country. That's why we have taken a very cautious decision about international quarantine, and this is not a position I relish being in, it also means that we have to take a very close look at making sure that we are not seeing the virus come in from other parts of the UK. That's not political, it is not constitutional, it is just taking a similar view to countries across the world in terms of protecting populations from the risk of the virus. It is not something we have decided to do at this stage and not something I'm immediately planning to do but I will take decisions the best I can to protect the health of Scotland and to take that absolutely from a public health perspective. What are you looking at in a public health perspective? Are you waiting to see if there is a further increase in infection levels in England? And if that's the case, and you decide to ask people from England coming into Scotland to quarantine, how do you do that practically? Well, look, don't focus all of this discussion on quarantine. One of the things that I think we must do in the immediate term, and I took part in a meeting, telephone meeting with Michael Gove and the other First Minister's earlier last week, and we need to work together on outbreak management. We recently had a cross-border outbreak. We think it started in Carlisle but spreading to Dumfries and Galloway so we worked together to make sure the right restrictions were in place. Fundamentally this is about where there are outbreaks, as there is in Leicester right now, the right outbreak management being put in place and that then mitigates against having to put any border restrictions in place. So we need to look at these things very carefully and we need to be driven entirely by public health considerations. We saw some of your more enthusiastic supporters recently trying to stop cars at the border and turn them back. That's the kind of thing, from your tone, that you absolutely don't want to happen again. Absolutely not. This is not about saying to people in England they are not welcome in Scotland, of course people in England are welcome in Scotland, lots of people in England live in Scotland and vice versa, this is not about politics or a constitutional agenda, it's just about taking decisions that try and protect people in Scotland as much as possible from Covid, just as the UK Government I'm sure wants to do everything it can to protect the population in England. If you look at the situation in Australia, you can't travel from Melbourne to Sydney because of the spike in cases in Melbourne. The Governor of New York has restricted travel from some of the worst affected states in America into New York. Leaders across the world are taking these very objective public health driven decisions, and I'm determined to do likewise. You have just made the case very strongly therefore quarantining people from England coming into Scotland. What would need to change? One of your own advisers Professor Devi Sridhar from Edinburgh University said many people cross the border every day and I think we will never get to full elimination of coronavirus without England's cooperation. I'd like to see the UK Government be more explicit that it was trying to get to levels of coronavirus that was virtually elimination levels but that is a decision for the Prime Minister and the UK Government to take. These are not decisions I will take lightly but they are not"

FRANTZMAN",NA,"Has Farrakhanism become mainstream in the US?",FALSE,"In recent weeks, a deluge of racist anti-Jewish comments have been made in the US. It started with NFL player DeSean Jackson quoting a fake Hitler quote that claimed ""the white Jews know that the Negroes are the real Children of Israel and to keep America's secret, the Jews will blackmail America. They will extort America, their plan for world domination."" The quote was condemned by the Philadelphia Eagles but received some surprising support and excuses from players and social-media commentators.
An ESPN article attempted to explain the origins of this antisemitism. It ascribed it to being uninformed and demonstrating a lack of understanding of antisemitism. This was ""naivete"" that comes from the ""dark areas of the Internet."" Of interest, the ESPN article claimed that the hate behind this ""uninformed"" rant was linked to the hate that caused a hate-crime shooting attack on Jews in New Jersey that was linked to Black Hebrew Israelite ideology. That shooting was in December 2019. Then there was the Monsey Hanukkah stabbing on December 28, weeks later.
The assertion that the hatred of Jews in the US is primarily due to people being uninformed and not understanding antisemitism is interesting in a country that for recent decades has raised two generations very attuned to the importance of anti-racism and multiculturalism. People have known what antisemitism and hatred of Jews is for hundreds of years. The idea that someone posting a quote of Hitler bashing Jews simply doesn't understand it appears to be a way to excuse the rising racism in America that targets Jews.
The US approach to different types of racism is interesting, especially in light of the intersectionality agenda that asserts that all racism and oppression is similar. When it comes to anti-Jewish views, this type of hatred doesn't seem to be taken as seriously. When it comes to anti-black racism, which has been spotlighted by the Black Lives Matter protests, the reaction is unequivocal: Racism is wrong, and racists must be confronted and canceled.
This is why movies like Gone with the Wind are banned. Anything that could be construed as excusing racism is removed. Not so when it comes to Jews. When rapper Ice Cube tweeted an image of a mural widely considered antisemitic last month, there were articles highlighting the tweet, but little else in terms of repercussions. Jews are one group that can be openly derided in the US, increasingly without much pushback. The NFL player was invited for a polite talk with a Holocaust survivor, for instance.
Why the relative silence after the NFL antisemitism? Groups that track antisemitism have accused Larry Johnson, another NFL player, of posting anti-Jewish views, and they noted that Nick Cannon, a video TV host, has spread anti-Jewish conspiracies. The views here dovetailed with the ones above. ""The Semitic people are black people,"" Jewish Insider reported Cannon as saying.
These views apparently go back decades. Hip-hop artist Professor Griff, who was on the recent TV show with Cannon, had once claimed Jews are ""wicked"" and responsible for ""wickedness that goes on across the globe."" That leads to claims that the ""Rothschilds"" control banks and the Zionists control things, etc. The reaction: This is ranting; surprising to see it in the mainstream.
THIS FORM of American antisemitism is more mainstream today. The increasing support for Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, despite attempts consistently to portray his views as fringe, is one part of this. Articles portray Farrakhan as merely a ""lightning rod in Black-Jewish relations for his long history of antisemitic comments that many Jews find offensive,"" notes Forbes.
The Forbes article makes it seem like Jews are the problem for being offended, which leads to the question: Why didn't a broader swath of the anti-racism movement mobilize against this Jew hatred? A simple search on Twitter reveals the wider problem. In response to a critique of Farrakhan, these comments don't blame Armenians or Baha'i for slavery; they blame Jews for slavery.
This new agenda seeks to single out Jews as ""white Jews"" and then blame Jews for slavery while also claiming that Africans are the real Jews and real Semites. It is a very complex worldview unique to an American form of antisemitism that has no direct global parallel.
Historic antisemitism blamed Jews for being rootless and undermining European Christian society, whereas this American antisemitism attacks Jews for being white - Rothschilds - who allegedly are responsible for US slavery and white supremacism. Whereas Nazism hated Jews for being nonwhite (and not of the Aryan Master Race in Nazi ideology), in the US, Jews are increasingly singled out for being white.
How and why did this happen? In 1984, The New York Times reported on a Farrakhan speech in which he said: ""The Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man. He wasn't great for me as a black person, but he was a great German."" He praised Hitler for raising up Germany. ""Well, in a sense you could say there's similarity in that we are rising our people up from nothing.""
The rise in this rhetoric from the 1980s to today has been possible because it has never really been confronted. It has instead been excused or portrayed as fringe. The Forward ran an op-ed article in October 2018 explaining ""black antisemitism."" The article excoriated ""white Jewish people"" as part of the ""racist system that keeps black people under the foot of this society."" The article asserted that ""black antisemites are motivated by anger over gentrification, police brutality and slavery."" The article accused Jews of being part of white supremacy and the ""racist system"" and insinuated that hatred of Jews was due to Jews being behind police brutality and slavery.
This was in a Jewish newspaper, explaining and excusing hatred of Jews. That is how mainstream it had become.
Similar comments, claiming that ""white Jews uphold white supremacy"" became a key part of the controversy within the Women's March in 2018. It turned out that Jews were singled out, labeled ""white"" and then made to appear to be part of the problem, as opposed to one of many US minorities.
At the same time as Jews are increasingly singled out as ""white"" and accused of being responsible for white-supremacist ideology and slavery in the US - while at the same time being told that they are ""fake Jews"" - there is a massive rise in violent attacks on Orthodox Jews in places like New York City. Many of these attacks have attributes similar to the discussion above, with attackers claiming the victims are ""fake"" or blaming them for things Jews didn't do.
MORE THAN half of hate crimes in New York City are against Jews, at the very time that Jews are said to be ""white"" and thus part of the white majority. This divide - between rhetoric and reality - underpins the antisemitism that appears underpinned by rhetoric that is common in circles that support Farrakhan or groups self-described as ""Black Hebrew Israelites.""
The commonality between these apparently disparate strains of antisemitism - blaming ""Rothschilds"" for controlling media, assertions that Jews controlled slavery, that Jews are white supremacists and that the real Semites are African - is part of a multilayered anti-Jewish rhetoric that has not only become more mainstream and violent, but is not really being confronted. It is now largely forgotten that a member of the Washington City Council in March 2018 claimed the Rothschilds control the weather.
This is a complex anti-Jewish worldview that is built on comments that have been percolating for decades and focuses exclusively on Jews. It's as arbitrary to blame Jews for US slavery as to blame Scottish people. No one claims American Armenians are ""fake"" Armenians who are part of ""white supremacy."" When one views this systemic anti-Jewish rhetoric through a prism and asks why other groups aren't similarly singled out, it becomes abundantly clear that this rhetoric is not just uninformed ideas or naive conspiracies, but is part of a worldview.
Where does the accusation that Jews played a large part in slavery come from? Who benefits from twisting around the actual reality of slavery and making it a ""Jewish"" crime? The conspiracy theories that underpin this US antisemitism have sought to pin American racism on Jews and blame Jews for slavery.
The impunity these antisemites enjoy is largely because the US can't seem to weigh various racist prejudices at the same time. This is especially so when some of the most racist anti-Jewish voices ostensibly come from the same groups fighting against racism. From the Women's March to Black Lives Matter, there was an attempt by some to exclude Jews and then single out Jews for criticism.
It is difficult to confront this ant-Jewish hatred because it evolved from within a sector of a minority community and is not widely confronted within that community. So long as Farrakhan or other groups that push conspiracy theories are excused or given impunity to push their views, this growing antisemitism likely won't be reduced. That it exists in entertainment, sports and often on the sidelines of major activists' movements shows it is mainstream.

Two pro-police groups have filed a lawsuit against New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio after he denied their request to paint a 'Blue Lives Matter' mural in Manhattan, similar to the one Black Lives Matter painted outside of Trump Tower.
The lawsuit, filed late Monday by Blue Lives Matter NYC and Standing up for NYC in the Southern District of New York, accuses de Blasio and Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg of violating the groups' First Amendment rights.
According to the organizations, the alleged constitutional breach stems from de Blasio and Trottenberg allowing 'city property to be used by private speakers' - yet forbidding a similar mural in support of law enforcement.
'The ""Black Lives Matter"" message is highly political and is generally understood by the public to be and support a general anti-police message, include some extreme measures as defunding the police and ending police activity,' the suit reads.
The groups wanted to emblazon the words 'Blue Lives Matter' on the street outside One Police Plaza to call attention to the dangers of policing that officer face every day on the job, they said.
They also suggested using Broadway and West 45th Street in midtown as an alternative location, but both suggestions were denied by City Hall.
Founder of Blue Lives Matter NYC, Sgt. Joe Imperatrice, said in a statement that he just wanted 'to be granted the same privilege to bring to light a cause that we so believe in would change the trajectory of equality for all those with the same interest.
'Certain politicians have gotten away from equality and fairness for all, and have given privilege to certain groups,' Imperatrice continued. 'That's not what being American is all about - and that's sure not what being a New Yorker is all about.'
In their original plea to de Blasio last month, the group saluted the mayor for his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his attempts to bring awareness to systemic racism, but wanted to shed light on a cause of their own.
'As you may know, as of today, over 30 Police Officers have been killed in line of duty by firearms this year alone,' a joint statement from the two groups read. 
'We would like to raise awareness regarding preventable murders of those who swore an oath to serve and protect their communities, and honor the lives and memory of public servants whose heroic lives ended too soon.'
The group said they would pay for the mural themselves, and said they were counting on de Blasio's 'unbiased support' for the proposed project.
De Blasio later refused the request, declaring in late July that Black Lives Matter 'transcends any notion of politics ... This is about something much bigger than any one group.'
Standing up for NYC co-founder Jason Cohen voiced his disappointment over de Blasio's decision Tuesday, writing in a statement announcing the suit that the mural would have been 'significant in many aspects, mainly to honor the memories of those NYPD officer who gave their lives as the ultimate sacrifice'
'It's also relevant toward boosting the moral for our men and women who wear the blue uniform which becomes their lives, in response to a City that now scorns and defunds them,' he added.
Fellow group co-founder Tatiana Davidoff, said she believe painting the Blue Lives Matter mural was the 'smallest thing' the city could do to show its 'respect for [police] during these controversial times.'
The Blue Lives Matter organization, a loosely affiliated group of police officers, emerged as a counter-movement to the Black Lives Matter movement after the 2014 killings of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.
The group has inspired some state-level legislation seeking to make law enforcement a protected class under hate crime laws.
A coalition of civil rights groups - including the NAAACP - slammed that legislation as a 'political response' to nationwide calls for police reform.
De Blasio, meanwhile, approved a series of Black Lives Matter murals throughout the Big Apple last month, even participating in painting a small portion of the one outside of Trump tower, which the president said would be 'denigrating' Fifth Avenue.
'President Trump said we would be denigrating the luxury of Fifth Avenue,' De Blasio said in response to Trump's tweet. 'Let me tell you: we're not denigrating anything, we are liberating Fifth Avenue, we are uplifting Fifth Avenue.'
City Hall has not yet responded to a DailyMail.com request for comment on the lawsuit."
136,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Targeted News Service",2020-11-24,"7684 words",NA,"Targeted News Service",NA,"Sen. Schumer Safely Completes Tour of All 62 New York Counties",FALSE,"Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-New York, issued the following news release on Nov. 23:
Even a year as tumultuous as 2020, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Senate Democratic Leader, today completed his 22nd consecutive tour of all 62 New York State counties--an accomplishment that continues his track record as the first New York State public official to visit every single county in New York each year he has been in office.
Over the course of the year, Schumer made 86 county visits to Upstate New York and Long Island. He visited counties in the Capital Region 15 times; Western New York 6 times; Central New York 8 times; the Rochester-Finger Lakes 12 times; the Southern Tier 10 times; the Hudson Valley 14 times; the North Country 8 times; and Long Island 13 times.
""22 years ago, upon my election to the United States Senate in 1998, I promised that each and every year I served, I would visit all 62 of New York State's diverse counties. Not only has this ritual remained a steadfast passion of mine because of all I learn from my constituents and bring to Washington, D.C. as both a senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate,"" said Senator Schumer. ""Especially this year, when New York battled the global health and economic pandemic especially hard, visiting all 62 counties was vital for me to learn firsthand the struggles and needs of New Yorkers, from one end of the state to the other. Through a year that much has changed - I, too, traveled with masks and disinfectant in tow to much smaller and more understated events - one thing remained the same: my commitment, dedication, and love for New York. This year, more than ever before, I learned more about the struggles and needs of New York and saw New Yorkers resilience, perseverance, and grit and time and time again the very best New York has to offer even during our darkest of days.""
Schumer added, ""Although I've gained the title of Senate Democratic Leader, my proudest and most principal titles have been, and will always remain, New York's Senator and 'New Yorker.' At the close of twenty-two years, my beliefs are as clear as ever: 'Senators who stay in Washington and never return home are simply not doing their job.' Although this year looked a little different with online or-socially distanced events and celebrations, that's why I safely go to all of the places that I can. Whether I'm celebrating a virtual high school graduation or fighting for our first responders all over the state, I'm always learning more about New York directly from my constituents.""
Some of the key highlights include:
New York State
Delivered $167 Billion For New York In COVID Relief: During negotiations for the CARES Act, Schumer worked for days to deliver a plan that best protected New York's workers, small businesses, and health centers so they could receive the help they needed amidst the COVID crisis. The CARES Act Included:
Over $37 billion In Federal Funding For 'Unemployment Insurance On Steroids' Relief For New Yorkers: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer successfully fought for and secured a historic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance (UI). Importantly, economists have credited the UI expansion with mitigating a larger increase in poverty. The Senator conceived this plan with an understanding of how the modern New York economy functions, expanding unemployment benefits to more than 1.8 million freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors, and other workers in non-traditional employment across New York State since the start of the pandemic. The extended and expanded UI programs in the CARES Act also increased the maximum unemployment benefit amount by $600 per week above one's base unemployment compensation benefit for four months and ensured that workers who were laid-off or out of work through no fault of their own, on average, received their full pay for a full quarter. Additionally, Senator Schumer secured 100% federal financing of benefits paid through existing state Shared Work programs, allowing thousands of New York employers to avoid layoffs during the downturn by connecting their employees who are working reduced hours with partial UI compensation.
$10.7 Billion In Emergency Federal Funding For NYS Hospitals, Health Systems, And Community Health Centers: The chief architect of the 'Marshall Plan for Healthcare' in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured over $10.7 billion for New York state's hospitals, health systems, and community health centers. New York also received the lion's share of the initial $10 billion designated for 'hot spots' nationally, receiving $4.5 billion. The funding allowed hospitals and health systems across New York state to cover unreimbursed health care related expenses or make up for lost revenues attributable to the public health emergency resulting from COVID-19, especially from cancelled elective procedures, increased staffing and overtime costs, expanded bed capacity, and increased spending on supplies and equipment to meet the surge in COVID-19 patients.
More Than $55 billion In Paycheck Protection Program And Economic Injury Disaster Loan And Grant Funding For New York's Small Businesses And Nonprofits: Senator Schumer, a longtime champion of small businesses and nonprofits across New York, negotiated a small business rescue plan that allocated over $38.6 billion in forgivable loans through close to 349,000 awards to New York's small businesses and nonprofits so they could maintain their existing workforce and help pay for other expenses, including rent, mortgage, or utilities. Self-employed, independent contractors, and sole proprietors were also eligible for assistance. Schumer also fought to ensure nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business relief. Because of Schumer's efforts, a PPP set-aside was created in COVID relief legislation that passed following the CARES Act to provide more assistance to underserved businesses. This $60 billion set-aside was for lending through community lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI), Minority Depository Institutions, and microloans to expand access to minority-owned and other underserved small businesses and nonprofits. This included a specific $10 billion CDFI set-aside established by the Treasury Department after Schumer's relentless advocacy. Senator Schumer also fought to create in the CARES Act a new Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) cash advance grant program that provided more than $1.3 billion in grant funding to over 450,000 New York small businesses and nonprofits. More than $17.3 billion in EIDL loan assistance was awarded as well. In addition, Schumer successfully added farms and value-added farm businesses as eligible recipients of EIDL loans and grants to provide New York's agricultural economy a lifeline in this crisis.
* Over $3.4 Billion For Economic Development And Public Infrastructure through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): With $1 billion allocated to New York state and over $2.4 billion allocated directly to communities across New York, Senator Schumer secured over $3.4 billion in CDBG funding in the CARES Act that supports local economic growth, community revitalization, and affordable housing. The funding allows New York state and communities to create good-paying jobs, continue delivering essential services, and invest in affordable housing at a time when the COVID crisis had endangered all community services.
* Over $4 billion For New York Transit Systems: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer secured $4,158,708,448 for transit systems across New York State. The funding enabled transit systems to continue operating safely during the pandemic to allow essential workers to commute to their jobs and act as a lifeline for transit riders without a car to continue to access every day essential services.
* Over $411 Million For New York Airports: As the COVID-19 crisis immediately impacted the travel industry, Senator Schumer secured $411,274,414.22 in the CARES Act for airports all across New York state. The funding increased the federal share in the Airport Improvement program and other grants already planned for the fiscal year 2020, to 100%. The additional funding and elimination of the local share allowed for critical safety and capacity projects to continue as planned despite the financial impact of the COVID crisis on airports.
* Over $15.7 Billion In Direct Cash Payments To Individuals And Families Across the State: The CARES Act provided critical financial support in the form of one-time Economic Impact Payments of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples below a certain income threshold, as well as an additional $500 payment per dependent child. More than 9.8 million of these direct cash payments were delivered to lower and middle-income New Yorkers this year, helping working families cover their household expenses and weather this unprecedented economic crisis. Senator Schumer also successfully called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reverse its original guidance and streamline these direct payments to Social Security recipients, ensuring that seniors and other vulnerable New Yorkers would not have to take an additional, unnecessary step of filing tax returns in order to receive this assistance.
* $1.5 Billion In Testing Funding For New York State: In May, Senator Schumer announced that New York state received $1.5 billion out of a $10.25 billion national pot for coronavirus (COVID-19) testing he proposed and fought to secure as a lead negotiator in the 'Corona 3.5' legislation. Specifically, New York State received $700,248,982 and New York City received $807,512,729 that can be used for COVID-19 testing purposes, including for testing equipment and supplies, contract tracing and surveillance, personal protective equipment and more.
* Secured $7 Billion In Loans For New York Hospitals And Providers: In addition to the grant money he secured, Senator Schumer secured roughly $7 billion in loans for New York hospitals and health care providers. This additional cash flow provided a lifeline to those providers as they weathered caring for Covid-19 patients and major revenue losses from shutting down as many of their services as possible. Schumer subsequently re-negotiated the repayment terms for these loans to make them far more favorable to New York providers, ensuring that they had all the resources they needed to combat the pandemic.
* Expanded SNAP Benefits, Secured An Additional $162 Million In Funding For Child Care, Continued Nutrition For Seniors, And Delivered Nearly $1 Billion To Help Heat Homes When Income Becomes A Problem
* Secured $2.15B For K-12 Schools And Institutions Of Higher Education Across New York: In the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought and secured $1 billion for K-12 schools through the Education Stabilization Fund, $164 million under the Governor's Emergency Education fund, and over $900 million for institutions of Higher Education. This pandemic relief helped support the education sector as it worked to meet the educational needs of students across the state.
Secured Nation's First Major Disaster Declaration for COVID-19, Unlocking Almost $6 billion In Federal FEMA Support for New York State: Following Schumer's tireless advocacy and early calls for broad federal support from FEMA, New York State was granted the first Major Disaster Declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic of any state in the country. Schumer has continued to push the Administrator and the President to provide all support available to New York under FEMA's control, delivering almost $6 billion for the state thus far, with over $1 billion in reimbursement for COVID-19 costs incurred by the state, localities, and eligible non-profits, like purchasing personal protective equipment and paying health care workers overtime.
Secured Over $6 Billion In FMAP Funds For NYS And Its Counties To Provide Vital Budget And Health Care Relief: Senator Schumer successfully pushed for Congress to include a cost-sharing provision in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act so New York's counties, which pay part of Medicaid's costs, could benefit from the increase federal Medicaid support. Schumer had successfully championed this provision in prior disaster response legislation, including after 9-11, Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 financial meltdown. The legislation immediately unlocked over $6 billion in state-wide dollars related to healthcare funds known as 'FMAP' for New York state and its counties to cover healthcare costs, $1 billion in unemployment benefits, free testing, pair emergency leave, meals for homebound seniors, and other critical services.
Fighting Hunger By Securing Pandemic-EBT Program Extension through September 2021: After tirelessly advocating for expanded nutrition benefits, Senator Schumer secured numerous nutrition benefits in the negotiations for the Continuing Resolution. The Continuing Resolution extended P-EBT benefits through September 30, 2021 and creates a pathway to allow territories to participate in the P-EBT program. Roughly 2.1 million students across New York State are eligible for the P-EBT program, which provides families with additional nutrition assistance for students when schools are closed or in virtual learning.
Boosted NYS Hemp Growers and Producers To Create Jobs: Senator Schumer called on USDA to delay the implementation of the USDA's U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program final rule and urged USDA to respond to the numerous concerns of hemp growers and producers in Upstate NY. The senator worked closely with the House of Representatives to include language in the Continuing Resolution that extends the authorization for the 2014 hemp pilot program regulations through September 30, 2021, which will give New York hemp farmers additional time to come into compliance with USDA's new regulations for hemp.
Secured Over $409 Million for NYS Farmers: Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Senator Schumer has pushed USDA to expand the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to include as many commodities as possible and ensure New York State farmers receive the assistance they need. Senator Schumer lobbied USDA to include more specialty crops, small livestock, goats, microgreens, nursery and greenhouse commodities, nontraditional crops, and more on the list of eligible crops for CFAP. Following his efforts, USDA expanded the eligibility lists for CFAP 1 and rolled out a second CFAP program, CFAP 2, which included a significantly expanded list of eligible crops. To date, New York farmers have received over $222 million in assistance through the CFAP 1 program and $187 million through CFAP 2.
Secured A Major Disaster Declaration And Disaster Funding After Tropical Storm Isaias And Demanded Answers From Electricity CEOs: After Tropical Storm Isaias ripped through the Hudson Valley, New York City, and Long Island, Senator Schumer personally called the CEOs of Con Edison, Central Hudson, and PSEG to demand answers for why New Yorkers were left without power for days following inadequate communication. Schumer also sent a letter to the President urging him to declare this a major disaster and unlock millions in federal funds for the impacted region. After receiving this letter, the President granted the declaration for the 7 worst hit counties.
Called on TSA to Keep Agency Secure by Eliminating Its Use of TikTok: Citing concerns about communicating with the public via TikTok, Schumer called on the Transit Security Administration to reconsider its use of the platform and consult with the Department of Homeland Security, given laws that compel Chinese companies like partially China-owned TikTok to share data with the Chinese Communist Party. After raising the alarm, TSA discontinued its use of the social media platform.
NYC
Awarding Of Construction Contract On The Jamaica Armory Project After Senator Schumer Secured $91 Million In Funding: A construction contract has been awarded to further make progress on the Jamaica Armory project for both a 41,000 square foot addition to the readiness center and the restoration of the 140,000 square foot facility to support the center's training, administrative, and logistical needs. The modernization of the Jamaica armory will create jobs and act as an anchor to the Southeast Queens community, the National Guard, and all of New York City.
Established PPP Set-Asides For Lending To Underserved Small Businesses And Communities Of Color: After the enactment of the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) in the CARES Act, Senator Schumer fought to provide more focused relief to the most underserved small businesses, which are often located in communities of color. As part of the subsequent COVID 3.5 bill - the ""Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act"" - Schumer negotiated a $60 billion PPP set-aside for small and mid-sized community lenders, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and microloan funds. After that bill passed, Schumer sent letters and placed calls to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, calling on him to create an even more narrowly focused set-aside for CDFIs and MDIs. In May, Secretary Mnuchin and the Small Business Administration heeded the calls of Sen. Schumer by announcing they would set aside $10 billion exclusively for PPP lending through CDFIs.
Delivered Billions in Aid To Save Our Subways, Busses and MTA; Delivered Two Financial Lifelines To The MTA As Ridership Levels Plummeted: As ridership levels on the Metropolitan Transit Authority's network of subways, buses, and commuter rails dropped to historic lows due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, Senator Schumer prevailed in the face of Republican intransigence to secure nearly $4 billion to stop the fiscal bleeding at the nation's largest public transit network. These funds stabilized the MTA's finances as it undertook an historic subway car cleaning program and other safety measures to keep the system running through the worst of the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, Sen. Schumer successfully secured access to the Federal Reserve's Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) for the MTA and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey after he appealed directly to Fed Chairman Jay Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. To date, the MTA has tapped the MLF for $450 billion in debt relief.
Delivered Urgent Aid To Parishes, Churches, Schools To Enable Then To Survive The COVID Lockdown: As a result of Schumer's efforts, nonprofits as well as churches, other houses of worship, and faith-based service organizations were made eligible for small business COVID relief.

Hosted Workshop With Local Faith-Based Community Organizations To Broaden Access To Nonprofit Security Funding Amid Troubling Increase In Hate Crimes, Leading To Largest Number of Grants Ever Awarded to NYC Area In Program History: Following his successful push for an historic 50 percent increase - $30 million - in Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) funding at the end of last year, Senator Schumer sent a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the NYS Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) calling for a series of workshops and webinars to assist New York-based religious institutions applying to strengthen their security preparedness against religiously motivated attacks like in Monsey. In February, Sen. Schumer's office co-hosted a workshop in Manhattan with Sen. Gillibrand's office, FEMA, DHSES, the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and New York Police Department that brought together dozens of local churches, synagogues, mosques, parochial schools, and other faith-based community organizations to discuss the application process for NSGP. In July, DHS announced over $12 million in nonprofit security grants for 138 NYC area organizations, the greatest funding amount nationwide and the largest number of grants ever awarded to the NYC area in program history.
CAPITAL REGION
Secured $15.3M In The CARES Act For Albany International Airport Which Was Severely Disrupted By The Pandemic: With travel business dropping almost 80%, airports have struggled. Not only is the direct revenue down but all of the tenant businesses located at the airport have been affected as well.
Troy Seawall Stabilization And Riverfront Park North Projects Completed: In September, Sen. Schumer joined Troy Mayor Patrick Madden in cutting the ribbon on this important project. The Seawall was compromised by the flooding during Tropical Storm Irene, leaving the fledgling downtown and key infrastructure vulnerable to a catastrophic flood.

Successfully Fought For USACE Funding To Research Harmful Algal Blooms At Chautauqua Lake And Keep Western NY Economy Afloat: Following his push for more Harmful Algal Bloom funding in the FY 20 Appropriations Package, Schumer called on the research division of the Army Corps to spend a portion of that funding on ways to prevent and eliminate harmful algal blooms in New York, specifically Lake Chautauqua. Harmful Algal Blooms can be toxic to pets and humans and limit the number of recreation days for residents and visitors to enjoy--thereby also limiting tourism spending, a key component in the local economy. The Corps heeded his call and in late August 2020, they successfully launched a pilot program to begin testing and research at Lake Chautauqua. Schumer continues to push for renewed HABs funding in the FY21 appropriations omnibus so that the Lake Chautauqua pilot can be taken to full-scale in the coming years.
Secured $16 Million For CUBRC To Construct A State-Of-The-Art Long-Duration Testing Facility: The funding will continue to boost the Western New York economy and will support the state-of-the-art complex to continue to compete with international competitors like Russia and China in performing hypervelocity weapons systems tests.

Secured Over $100M In Funding For Now-Completed Job-Boosting WNY Construction Projects: Senator Schumer's tireless efforts to securing federal funding for important projects across Western New York culminated in the completion of two major projects in 2020. First, the Athol Springs Break Wall along Route 5 in the Town of Hamburg was recently completed, allowing a safer winter commute for drivers along the traditionally icy and wind-blown thoroughfare. Senator Schumer was also instrumental in facilitating the modernization project at the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge Plaza. The second phase of the project, featuring a state-of-the-art processing facility, was opened in mid-October.
Successfully Advocated For Buffalo To Host The Toronto Blue Jays: The continued closure of the border between the United States and Canada to all non-essential personnel left the Toronto Blue Jays unable to host home games at Rogers Center in Toronto during the abbreviated 2020 Major League season. Senator Schumer was relentless in his advocacy for Rich Baseball Operations and the City of Buffalo to host the Toronto Blue Jays at Sahlen Field, home of the AAA Blue Jays affiliated Bisons. After his push, the Blue Jays and Major League Baseball made Buffalo their home and brought Major League Baseball games back to the city for the first time since 1915.

Senator Schumer Fought To Secure A Level Playing Field For L3Harris To Compete And Ultimately Secure A $95 Million Order To Produce Innovative MANPACK Radios For The U.S. Army In Rochester: This is the third order of radios that L3Harris will produce under the Army's $12.7 billion Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) HMS Manpack radio contract. Senator had long pushed to ensure a full and fair Army procurement process for the Manpack radio to ensure that companies like L3Harris would have an even playing field to compete.
SOUTHERN TIER
Saved Minor League Baseball And Secured Class AA Affiliation For Rumble Ponies In Binghamton: Senator Schumer fought tooth and nail to preserve the Binghamton Rumble Ponies. After working for over a year to save the team, the senator announced earlier this month that the Mets had chosen to continue their affiliation with the Rumble Ponies and that the team would remain a Class AA affiliate. Last November, after hearing that MLB proposed plans to form a new league that would mean the reassignment of four teams across New York state, including the Rumble Ponies, Schumer sprang into action to keep baseball in Binghamton, writing to MLB to express his concerns about the proposal and urging the league sit down with local stakeholders to work out a plan that would maintain minor league baseball's strong presence in Upstate New York. Last December, the senator personally met with MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred in New York City to once again urge him to keep the Rumble Ponies in Binghamton. Additionally, in February of this year, Schumer invited MLB and Mets top brass to tour NYSEG Stadium with him and hear directly from stakeholders themselves. Even after touring the stadium, Senator Schumer continued to push for the Rumble Ponies in numerous calls with Commissioner Manfred and Mets' ownership, ultimately securing their commitments to preserve the Rumble Ponies and their Mets affiliation.
Delivered $204 Million To Corning Inc. To Substantially Expand Manufacturing For Accelerated Production Of Valor(R) Glass Vials For Secure Delivery Of Future COVID-19 Vaccine And Doubling Employment Of Horseheads Facility: In the CARES Act negotiations, Senator Schumer successfully fought to increase the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) budget to $7.1B enabling the award of millions of critical funding to entities prepared to support the urgent needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, $204M of this vital federal funding was awarded to Corning Inc. to jumpstart production of their Valor(R) Glass vials that will be used for the rapid production and secure delivery of an upcoming coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and other critical drugs. Corning's Valor(R) Glass is engineered to resist damage, prevent cracks, and includes a revolutionary coating that enables vials to speed through pharmaceutical filling lines. In addition, this federal investment will lead to doubling the employment at Corning Inc.'s Horsehead facility in Chemung County.
Secured Close To $750,000 For Prattsburgh Wastewater Business District Project: After calling for federal Economic Development Administration (EDA) funding to support Prattsburgh's Business District Wastewater Project late last year, in May of this year, the EDA awarded the Town of Prattsburgh with $748,500 to build a wastewater collection, over 1,000 feet of wastewater collection sewer lines, manholes, a pump station, and allow for further improvements to the facility's treatment capacity collection system. This EDA funding was combined with an additional $200,000 federal Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) grant award. The project will secure sustainability for 11 existing businesses, support the creation of 15 new jobs, help retain 63 existing jobs, leverage $700,000 in private investment, and encourage the re-occupancy of empty commercial space in Prattsburgh's Business District.
Secured Over $1.5M In Federal Funds To Start Critical Broadband Project To Bring High-Speed Internet To Counties Across The Southern Tier: After calling for the Economic Development Administration to provide additional funds to match an award from the Appalachian Regional Commission, Schumer secured the full $1,552,593 to revitalize the Southern Tier Network, Inc. (STN) in Corning's High Speed Network. The EDA contribution provided the final piece of funding needed to begin the project which will support business development, economic growth, and new jobs throughout the region.
Kept Amtrak Growth On Track In Hornell With Permit Approval For Next Gen High-Speed Trainset: After Alstom's Hornell facility completed construction of the latest Next Gen High-Speed Amtrak Trainsets, Schumer successfully called on the FRA to approve the permit need to move the trainset to FRA's test track in Pueblo, Colorado. The FRA heeded his call and is now underway with testing the new trainsets. Once testing is complete, the trainsets can be fully-produced and placed into Amtrak service.
HUDSON VALLEY
Successfully Secured Over $168M In COVID Relief For Westchester County: In his CARES Act negotiations, Senator Schumer prioritized securing federal funding for Westchester County, one of the nations' first hotspots for COVID-19, and the County has used funds thus far to cover additional PPE and personnel costs, implement grant programs for struggling small businesses and nonprofits, create programs to bridge the technology gap for K-12 students, and more.
Successfully Pushed For Final Expanded Site Investigation At Stewart Air National Guard Base: Through his nonstop advocacy, Senator Schumer successfully pushed the Department of Defense (DoD) to finalize its Expanded Site Investigation (ESI) at Stewart Air National Guard Base (SANGB) this fall. The ESI is required in moving SANGB forward to the next phase of the DoD environmental remediation process, which is needed to clean up the Air National Guard's (ANG) PFAS contamination on base and its surrounding communities in Newburgh and New Windsor. Schumer also worked tirelessly to bring the Schumer-secured interim filtration device on Recreation Pond online to stop the flow of PFAS off base.
Delivered The $11.5M Needed To Hire 30 Additional Firefighters In The City Of Yonkers: After supporting the City of Yonkers Fire Department in their efforts to cut overtime costs by hiring 30 new firefighters, in September, Senator Schumer announced that he successfully secured over $11,580,930 in federal funding for the City of Yonkers Fire Department to hire 30 additional firefighters. The funding was allocated through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Program.
Secured Over $5.8 M To Protect Residents From Exposure To Arsenic-Contaminated Soil At The Kent Arsenic Mine Superfund Site In Putnam County: After learning from residents that bureaucratic hurdles could further delay the prompt cleanup of the Kent Arsenic Mine in Putnam County, Senator Schumer stepped in and cut through the red tape by contacting various state and federal agencies to secure the funding needed to protect residents from exposure to arsenic-contaminated soil at the Schumer-secured EPA Superfund site. In late September, Schumer secured over $5.8M from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in partnership with New York State, to begin the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) efforts to offer to acquire certain properties and permanently relocate impacted residents at their request.
Locked-In Over $30.4M To Improve Historic Hyde Park National Sites: Hyde Park is the home of Eleanor Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Sites, which comprises over 1,000 acres of historic land that had accumulated over $30.4 million of deferred maintenance over the years. This past August, Schumer stepped in and secured the $30.4 million federal investment needed to properly upkeep Dutchess County's iconic national historic sites which are key to tourism, acting as an economic engine for Hyde Park and its surrounding area.
Successfully Passed The National Purple Heart Honor Mission Commemorative Coin Act In U.S. Senate To Benefit Orange County's National Purple Heart Honor Mission: Senator Schumer introduced the bipartisan National Purple Heart Honor Mission Commemorative Coin Act last Veteran's Day, and this November announced its Senate passage. The legislation will require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and 50cents clad coins in 2022, commemorating our nation's Purple Heart recipients. All proceeds from the sale of the coins will contribute to the Orange County-based National Purple Heart Honor Mission, located in New Windsor, New York.
Secured Over $3.2M For Economic Development In The Town Of Cortlandt Ahead Of Indian Point's Impending 2021 Closure: Senator Schumer locked in over $3.2 million in federal funds for the Town of Cortlandt to boost economic activity in the Lower Hudson Valley when the Indian Point nuclear power plant shuts down in April 2021. This funding comes from a new program housed by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) that Schumer helped create to assist communities, like those surrounding Indian Point, offset the devastating economic impacts of a closing nuclear power plant.
NORTH COUNTRY
Secured $9 Million In DoD Funding For Watertown YMCA Community Center, Boosting Downtown Watertown, Fort Drum, And Regional Economy: After continued engagement with the DoD and a personal call with former Defense Secretary Esper, Senator Schumer successfully secured a $9 Million DoD grant to support the Watertown YMCA community center. The funding enables a project that will provide year-round community space for Fort Drum's military families in addition to bolstering downtown Watertown. The completed community center will have a six-lane lap pool, a separate full-size recreational pool, three exercise rooms, and arts/multipurpose room, two indoor tennis courts, and a community kitchen.
Ensured Funding To Deepen The Port Of Ogdensburg Remained Locked-In Place After Project Delay: In 2017, Senator Schumer secured funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to deepen the Ogdensburg Harbor and create new economic opportunities for the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority (OBPA). However the federal funds were in jeopardy as the project was delayed while OBPA sought additional funds to complete the project. In 2020, Senator Schumer worked with USACE keep the federal funding in place while OBPA successfully secured additional funding. The long-delayed project will finally begin this year and lead to increased commerce at the Port of Ogdensburg.
Secured Over $4 Million For Economic Development Projects Across The Northern Border: Senator Schumer secured $4,499,626 in federal funding for eight projects aimed at improving the economy in Northern New York.

LONG ISLAND
Delivered Historic $2.6 Billion Federal Investment To Construct World First Electron Ion Collider At Brookhaven National Lab On Long Island: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine that would allow scientists to look inside the building blocks of an atom. In 2018 Senator Schumer, a long time benefactor of BNL, urged the Department of Energy to construct a U.S.-based EIC after a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine published a report urging immediate action to advance fundamental research into nuclear physics as a national security interest. Sen. Schumer spearheaded Congressional commitment to advancing scientific research by using his role as Democratic Leader to ensure that DOE had enough funding to advance the construction of an EIC to the solicitation phase. DOE issued a request for proposals for construction of the EIC triggering a competition between BNL and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Senator Schumer successfully made the case to DOE that BNL's track record in constructing large user facilities of national significance like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) made them the ideal choice for the EIC. In early 2020, DOE announced that it had chosen BNL's proposal and would begin the process of providing funds to BNL beginning the design phase of this $2.6 billion atom smasher.
Steered Course Correction By U.S. Navy To Proactively Clean Up The Toxic Grumman Plume; Secured Navy Commitment To Finally Intercept Ever Expanding Plume After 20 Year Fight: The Navy-Grumman Plume is a 3,000+ acre mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emanating from the former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) and Grumman facilities in Bethpage which specialized in aviation, weapons and space exploration manufacturing from the 1930s to 1998. Schumer long championed the position that the state and the Navy should be working to ""hydraulically contain"" and remove the ever expanding plume from Long Island's sole source aquifer rather than focusing on its practice of ""wellhead treatment"" which addressed the problem on the surface but ignored the swiftly metastasizing chemicals underneath. For twenty years Senator Schumer advanced the ball by pushing the United States Geological Survey and later, the Navy to fully map the plume through federal legislation. With this new data secured by Senator Schumer, state health regulators realized that containment was possible and began working on a plan to contain the plume. At first recalcitrant, after Schumer's urging, the Navy began to work with the state on a plan to try to contain the ever expanding plume. In late 2020, Navy announced that they had developed a plan to intercept migrating plume, Navy would construct extraction wells along the Southern State Parkway to intercept plume before it reaches south shore communities like Massapequa and the Great South Bay.
Landed Department Of Energy National Center For Quantum Information Science At Brookhaven National Lab, Part Of $625 Million Federal Commitment To Quantum Science: Senator Schumer worked tirelessly in Congress to pass The National Quantum Initiative Act which directed the DOE to establish at least three national centers for the purpose of advancing the United States' knowledge in the field of Quantum Information Science (QIS). In 2019, after passage of the act, Schumer worked directly with the DOE Secretary to ensure Congress adequately funded DOE to swiftly establish the National QIS Centers while simultaneously urging him to consider BNL as one of the three sites based off of their achievements in advancing our knowledge of QIS. In early 2020, DOE announced up to $625 million over five years to fund five Quantum Research Centers including the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Labs.
Sounded The Alarm On Vital Equipment Taken Off Fire Island Post-Sandy Project And Moved To Project One-Mile From Mar-A-Lago: Schumer has long-fought for federal funding to shore up costal storm protections for communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy, including the Fire Island and Moriches Inlet project off of Long Island. Part-way through the construction work to replenish beaches this year and protect residents from future storm threats, the vitally needed dredging equipment--one of just a handful off the Atlantic Coast--was pulled off the project to complete another beach dredging project at Midtown Beach in Palm Beach County, Florida--a beach that already has a sea wall and sits just a mile from Mar-A-Lago--before turtle nesting season. Schumer called for an explanation of the decision and commitment that the dredging ship would return to Long Island on time to complete its New York work. After sounding the alarm and staying on top of the Army Corps in subsequent months, the dredge was returned to Long Island on time to resume its emergency coastal protection work.

137,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Jpost.com (The Jerusalem Post online edition)",2020-07-13,"1570 words",NA,"SETH J. FRANTZMAN",NA,"Has Farrakhanism become mainstream in the US?",FALSE,"In recent weeks a deluge of racist anti-Jewish comments have been made in the US. It started with NFL player DeSean Jackson quoting a fake Hitler quote that claimed ""the white Jews know that the Negroes are the real Children of Israel and to keep America's secret the Jews will blackmail America. They will extort America, their plan for world domination."" The quote was condemned by the Philadelphia Eagles but received some surprising support and excuses in other places, from players and social media commentators.
An article at ESPN attempted to explain the origins of this antisemitism. It ascribed it to being uninformed and demonstrating a lack of understanding of antisemitism. This was ""naivete"" that comes from the ""dark areas of the internet."" Of interest, the ESPN article claimed that the hate behind this ""uninformed"" rant was linked to the hate that caused a hate crime shooting attack on Jews in New Jersey that was linked to Black Hebrew Israelite ideology. That shooting was in December 2019. Then there was the Monsey Hannukah stabbing on December 28, weeks later.
The assertion that the hatred of Jews in the US is primarily due to people being uninformed and not understanding antisemitism is interesting in a country that for the last decades has raised two generations very attuned to the importance of anti-racism and multiculturalism. People have known what antisemitism and hatred of Jews is for hundreds of years. The idea that someone posting a quote of Hitler bashing Jews simply doesn't understand it appears to be a way to excuse the rising racism in America that targets Jews.
The US approach to different types of racism is interesting, especially in light of the intersectional agenda that asserts that all racism and oppression is similar. When it comes to anti-Jewish views, this type of hatred doesn't seem to be taken as seriously. When it comes to anti-black racism, which has been spotlighted by the Black Lives Matter protests, the reaction is unequivocal: Racism is wrong and racists must be confronted and cancelled. This is why movies like Gone with the Wind are banned. Anything that could be construed as excusing racism is removed. 
Not so when it comes to Jews. When Ice Cube tweeted an image of a mural widely considered antisemitic last month, there were articles highlighting the tweet, but little else in terms of repercussions. Jews are one group that can be openly derided in the US, increasingly without much pushback. The NFL player was invited for a polite talk with a Holocaust survivor, for instance.
Why the relative silence after the NFL antisemitism? Groups that track antisemitism have accused Larry Johnson, another NFL player, of posting anti-Jewish views, and noted that Nick Cannon, a video TV host, has spread anti-Jewish conspiracies. The views here dovetailed with the ones above. ""The semitic people are black people,"" The Jewish Insider reported Cannon saying. These views apparently go back decades. Hip hop artist Professor Griff, who was on the recent TV show with Cannon, had once claimed Jews are ""wicked"" and responsible for ""wickedness that goes on across the globe."" That leads to claims that the ""Rothschilds"" control banks and the Zionists control things, etc. The reaction: This is ranting, surprising to see it in the mainstream.
This form of American antisemitism is more mainstream today. The increasing support for Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, despite attempts consistently to portray his views as fringe, is one part of this. Articles portray Farrakhan as merely a ""lightning rod in Black-Jewish relations for his long history of anti-Semitic comments that many Jews find offensive,"" notes Forbes. The Forbes article makes it seem like Jews are the problem for being offended, which leads to the question of why a broader swath of the anti-racism movement didn't mobilize against this Jew hatred. A simple search on Twitter reveals the wider problem. These comments don't blame Armenians or Bahai for slavery, they blame Jews for slavery, in response to critique of Farrakhan. 
This new agenda seeks to single out Jews as ""white Jews"" and then blame Jews for slavery while also claiming that Africans are the real Jews and real Semites. It is a very complex worldview unique to an American form of antisemitism that has direct no global parallel. Historic antisemitism blamed Jews for being rootless and undermining European Christian society, whereas this American antisemitism attacks Jews for being, white, Rothschilds, who allegedly are responsible for US slavery and white supremacism. Whereas Nazism hated Jews for being non-White, in the US Jews are increasingly singled out for being white. 
How and why did this happen? In 1984 The New York Times reported on a Farrakhan speech in which he said ""the Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man. He wasn't great for me as a black person, but he was a great German."" He praised Hitler for raising up Germany. ""Well, in a sense you could say there's similarity in that we are rising our people up from nothing.""
The rise in this rhetoric from the 1980s to today has been possible because it has never really been confronted. It has instead been excused or portrayed as fringe. The Forward ran an oped article in October 2018 explaining ""black antisemitism."" The article excoriated ""white Jewish people"" as part of the ""racist system that keeps black people under the foot of this society."" 
The article asserted that ""black anti-Semites are motivated by anger over gentrification, police brutality, and slavery."" The article accused Jews of being part of white supremacy and the ""racist system"" and insinuated that hatred of Jews was due to Jews being behind police brutality and slavery. This was in a Jewish newspaper, explaining and excusing hatred of Jews. That is how mainstream it had become. Similar comments, claiming ""white Jews uphold white supremacy"" became a key part of the controversy within the Women's March in 2018. It turned out that Jews were singled out, labelled ""white"" and then made to appear to be part of the problem, as opposed to one in many US minorities.
At the same time as Jews are increasingly singled out as ""white"" and accused of being responsible for white supremacism and slavery in the US, while at the same time being told that they are ""fake Jews,"" there is a massive rise in violent attacks on Orthodox Jews in places like New York City. Many of these attacks have similar attributes to the discussion above, with attackers claiming the victims are ""fake"" or blaming them for things Jews didn't do.
More than half of hate crimes in New York City are against Jews, at the very time that Jews are said to be ""white"" and thus part of the white majority. This divide, between rhetoric and reality, underpins the antisemitism that appears underpinned by rhetoric that is common in circles that support Farrakhan or groups self-described as ""Black Hebrew Israelites.""
The commonality between these apparently disparate strains of antisemitism; blaming ""Rothschilds"" for controlling media, to assertions that Jews controlled slavery, and that Jews are white supremacists and the real Semites are African is part of a multi-layered anti-Jewish rhetoric that has not only become more mainstream and violent, but is not really being confronted. It is now largely forgotten that a member of the Washington, D.C city council in March 2018 claimed the Rothschilds control the weather.
This is a complex anti-Jewish worldview that is built on comments that have been percolating for decades and focuses exclusively on Jews.It's as arbitrary to blame Jews for US slavery as to blame Scottish people. No one claims American Armenians are ""fake"" Armenians who are part of ""white supremacy."" 
When one thinks of this systemic anti-Jewish rhetoric through the lens of why other groups aren't singled out, it becomes abundantly clear that this rhetoric is not just uninformed ideas or naïve conspiracies, but part of a worldview. Where does the accusation that Jews played a large part in slavery come from? Who benefits from twisting around the actual reality of slavery and making it a ""Jewish"" crime? The conspiracy theories that underpin this US antisemitism has sought to pin American racism on Jews, and blame Jews for slavery.
The impunity these anti-Semites enjoy is largely because the US can't seem to weigh various racism at the same time, especially when some of the most racist anti-Jewish voices ostensibly come from the same groups fighting against racism. From the Women's March to Black Lives Matter, there was an attempt by some to exclude Jews and then single out Jews for criticism. It is difficult to confront this ant-Jewish hatred because it evolved from within a sector of a minority community and is not widely confronted within that community. 
So long as Farrakhan or other groups that push conspiracy theories are excused of given impunity to push their views, this growing antisemitism likely won't be reduced. That it exists in entertainment, sports and often on the sidelines of major activists movements, shows it is mainstream.

Critics claimed that the incident was a hoax though there are no facts to support the allegations.What is known, thus far, is a noose was discovered in Wallace's garage stall Sunday, which is two weeks after he led calls for the removal of confederate flags from the racetrack. 
The discovery of the noose led to outrage, and an outpouring of support for Wallace as NASCARsaid that it was a heinous act.According to the New York Post[1], no fewer than 15 federal agents were summoned to investigate the incident. The noose they discovered was a small loop tied to the bottom of a rope on a garage door at the Talladega Superspeedway. It was presumably to make it much easier to raise and lower the doorand it had been there since last October.After two days of incendiary hysteria, NASCARboss, Steve Phelps admitted there was no hate crime.The FBI said that although the noose is now known to have been in garage No.4 in 2019, no one could know that Wallace would be assigned to that number during the previous week.NASCARalso admitted that the 'noose' in question was just a garage door pull, fashioned in the manner of a noose.The team which represented Menard released a statement one of the workers recalled seeing the same pull-down rope in the same garage during the fall. Tensions have been high in NASCAR since the sport banned the confederate flag at some of the events on June 10 in the wake of George Floyd protests.Wallace indicated that he had been the target of backlash from critics who said the noose was a setup. He added that he was mad because people had been testing his character and the person that he was.The race at the Talladega Superspeedway was postponed until Sunday because of thunderstorms. Dozens of drivers pushed Wallace's car to the front of the field before the Monday race in act of solidarity.

Virus-related laws include those offering help to essential workers, boosting unemployment benefits and requiring time off for sick employees. A resolution in Alabama formally encouraged fist-bumping over handshakes.
Legislatures also addressed police use of force against Black people and others of color after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to widespread protests against police brutality. Among other things, new laws will mandate oversight and reporting, create civilian review panels and require more disclosures about problem officers.
States including California, Delaware, Iowa, New York, Oregon and Utah passed bans on police chokeholds. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes while being recorded on video, even as Floyd pleaded for air.
New York state Assemblyman Walter T. Mosley noted the hundreds of Black men and women killed at the hands of police between the cries of ""I can't breathe"" by Eric Garner, who died after being put in a chokehold by New York City police in 2014, and those of Floyd in May.
Mosley, a Brooklyn Democrat who is Black, said the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act was ""an important step forward, but it will not be the last."" 
Despite reforms in some states, the response to Floyd's death was not uniform. Similar use-of-force or disciplinary proposals in several other states failed, and some even moved in the opposite direction.
Georgia created a new crime beginning Jan. 1 defined as bias-motivated intimidation, which would apply to the death or serious bodily injury of police, firefighters and emergency personnel. It also extends to cases involving more than $500 worth of damage to their property because of ""actual or perceived employment as a first responder."" Violations are punishable by one to five years in prison and a fine of as much as $5,000. 
The law was passed by Republicans over the objections of Democrats and civil liberties groups, who said police already have enough protections. Republicans insisted on the law as part of a deal to pass a new hate crimes law in Georgia that drew bipartisan support.
While legislatures tackled some elements of the coronavirus outbreak this year, most sessions had ended before the current wave of cases, deaths and renewed stay-at-home orders. Lawmakers of both major parties have vowed to make the pandemic response a centerpiece of their 2021 sessions, addressing issues ranging from school reopenings to governors' emergency powers.
The virus also refocused attention on the nation's uneven and expensive heath care system. Tackling issues of coverage and costs were common themes in 2020.
A Washington measure caps the monthly out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $100 until Jan. 1, 2023, and requires the state Health Care Authority to monitor the price of insulin. A new Connecticut law requires pharmacists to dispense a 30-day emergency supply of diabetes-related drugs and devices, with a price cap, for diabetics who have less than a week's supply. Both laws take effect Jan. 1.
""It's unconscionable that anyone should have to limit or go without a common and widely-available life-saving drug on an emergency basis in America in 2021,"" Connecticut state Sen. Derek Slap, a West Hartford Democrat, said in a statement.
A much-anticipated Medicaid expansion is coming to Oklahoma in the new year after years of resistance from Republicans in the Legislature and governor's office. Voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment expanding the federal-state insurance program to an additional estimated 215,000 low-income residents. It takes effect in July.
Lawmakers must determine how to cover the projected $164 million state share during their 2021 session. The cost could be considerably higher, given the number of Oklahomans who have lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the pandemic.
Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt had urged voters to reject the plan. He said the state would have to ""either raise taxes or cut services somewhere else like education, first responders, or roads and bridges"" to pay for the expansion.
A new law in Georgia aims to limit consumers from getting stuck with surprise medical bills by requiring insurers in many cases to pay for care by a doctor or at a hospital not within their network of providers. The law protects patients from financial responsibility beyond what they would normally have to pay. Instead, insurers and providers can take disputes to the state insurance commissioner. Minnesota also has what's being called a continuity of care law, going into effect Jan. 1.
Other notable laws taking effect in the new year:
- Voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota approved measures legalizing recreational marijuana. New Jersey's Democratic-led Legislature and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy are working to set up a legal marketplace and to update laws already on the books to decriminalize marijuana possession.
- Colorado will prohibit landlords from refusing to show, rent or lease housing based on a person's source of income or involvement in the type of contract required to receive public housing assistance. Landlords can still do credit checks, but the act makes it an unfair housing practice unless they're conducted checks for every prospective tenant.
- New Hampshire will make multiple changes to state laws regarding sexual assault. Starting Jan. 1, the definition of sexual assault will be expanded to include any sexual contact between school employees and students between the ages of 13 and 18. Previously, such contact could be considered consensual and not a crime if the student was 16 or 17. Other legislation taking effect in mid-January increases protections for sexual assault victims and requires colleges and universities to adopt sexual misconduct policies. The bill requires colleges to provide free access to medical and legal support services, anti-retaliation protections, confidential advising services, data on sexual violence, and prevention and response training.
- Georgia will require an audit starting in 2021 before movies and television productions are awarded the state's generous tax credit, which has allowed the highest subsidies of any state. The credit, which rebates up to 30 percent of a production's value, cost nearly $900 million in foregone tax revenue in 2019 as movie and TV production boomed in Georgia. Examinations were highly critical of the tax credit, finding some companies that received tax credits didn't earn them.
- California will require companies based there to have at least one board director by the end of 2021 who is a racial or sexual minority, with larger numbers required by 2022. Companies with 100 or more employees also must start sending information on employees' race, ethnicity and gender to the state.
- Connecticut employers must begin taking deductions from their employees' paychecks for a new paid family and medical leave program, under a state law passed in 2019. The state's estimated 100,000 businesses will be responsible for withholding half a percent from worker wages. Qualified employees can begin receiving benefits on Jan. 1, 2022. Massachusetts also begins a new paid family medical leave program in the new year. It offers a 12-week benefit in most cases, extending to 26 weeks for those caring for a military member undergoing treatment.
- Oklahoma will extend a property tax exemption for religious institutions to include property owned by a church if it conducts instruction of children from pre-K through grade 12.

Today, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 908, a resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian bigotry as related to COVID-19. The resolution, introduced by CAPAC First Vice Chair Rep. Grace Meng, is a response to the over 2,600 reported anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents in recent months which have been driven by misperceptions about the coronavirus and how it spreads. Leaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) issued the following statements:
CAPAC Leadership
Congresswoman Judy Chu (CA-27), CAPAC Chair:
""Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, America has experienced a spike in anti-Asian discrimination and hate crimes. In fact, over 2,600 anti-Asian hate incidents have been reported in just the last few months alone. An 89-year-old woman in New York was slapped and set on fire. A 16-year old boy in Los Angeles was beaten so badly he had to be hospitalized. And in Texas, a gunman shot a family at a Sam's Club saying he wanted to exterminate Asians. Each of these attackers, and thousands of others like them, have been inspired by the false perception that Asians are responsible for the virus - a perception that has been advanced by Donald Trump and Republicans who have insisted on using slurs like 'Wuhan virus,' 'China plague,' and 'Kung flu' even though they know they are dangerous. That is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have warned that associating a virus with a particular ethnic group or geographic area is dangerous. And that is why, as Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I have repeatedly urged President Trump and my colleagues in Congress to not spread misinformation and xenophobia related to COVID-19. Even the FBI warned earlier this year that this exact kind of xenophobic rhetoric could lead to an increase in hate crimes. But not only have Republicans refused to drop their racist language, they have refused to acknowledge the problem at all. I was so dismayed to see my Republican colleagues, one after the other, come to the floor today and tell the Asian American community that their suffering does not matter, and that they are indifferent to the consequences of the hate they are spreading. It is more important to Republicans that they spare Donald Trump any responsibility for the spread of the coronavirus than it is that they spare even one family from the pain of being victims of a hate crime. Fortunately, not everyone in Congress is as indifferent to the spread of violence and bigotry. I'm so incredibly grateful to our CAPAC First Vice Grace Meng for her leadership in introducing this important piece of legislation, and I appreciate all the members who spoke up and voted for this resolution to send a clear signal that we do not tolerate hatred or violence in this country.""
Congresswoman Grace Meng (NY-06), CAPAC First Vice Chair:
""Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been forced to endure demeaning and disgusting acts of bigotry and hate, consisting of everything from verbal assaults to physical attacks. The House needed to take a strong and public stand against this appalling intolerance, discrimination, and violence that has taken place all across the country during this public health crisis, and today it did just that. The rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and the blaming of Asian Americans for the spread of the coronavirus has been shameful and reckless, particularly when it comes from our nation's leaders such as President Trump, Majority Leader McCarthy and many others who have used terms like 'Chinese virus,' 'Wuhan virus,' and 'Kung-flu,' to stoke people's fears of COVID-19, scapegoat Asian Americans, and fan the flames of hate. But these are more than just hateful and irresponsible words. This language has fueled the increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian descent, and many Asian Americans continue to live in fear.
""When the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the U.S., I had advised the public about not singling out or stereotyping the Asian American community. But unfortunately, those efforts have not stopped acts of ignorance and bigotry from rearing their ugly heads. It's time for this hysteria and discrimination to end, and I hope that with the passage of my resolution, our nation will work its way towards that goal. I thank and commend all who supported my resolution and joined me in sending a message to the American people that we reject this unacceptable racism, xenophobia, and violence. This measure is about condemning hate and violence and attacks on innocent individuals. We're talking about people's lives and their right to feel and be safe.""
Congressman Mark Takano (CA-41), CAPAC Second Vice Chair:
""By referring to COVID-19 almost exclusively as the ""China virus,"" the President is fueling racism and inspiring targeted attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants and my Republican colleagues are blindly following suit. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a defining moment in our nation's history and if we want to defeat the virus that has already claimed more than 196,000 deaths, we cannot let intolerance, ignorance, or intimidation stand in our way. We must condemn this anti-Asian sentiment.""
Congressman Ted Lieu (CA-33), CAPAC Whip:
""Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced a surge in harassment and discrimination. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment camps of World War II to the murder of Vincent Chin, Asian Americans have been particularly susceptible to being discriminated against by the mistaken belief that we somehow are foreigners or have foreign ties. Now, President Trump's repeated insistence on calling COVID-19 the 'Chinese virus' and 'Kung Flu' has only fueled the hate. I'm pleased to support Congresswoman Grace Meng's resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19. We must collectively take a stand against intolerance and bigotry especially during these unprecedented times.""
Congressman Andy Kim (NJ-03), CAPAC Freshman Representative:
""I am proud to speak out against the rise in hate alongside so many of my AAPI colleagues. Many of us have seen firsthand the vitriol of racism and felt the sting of a distrustful look or a harsh word. This resolution allows Congress to come together to speak with one voice - that hate targeted at the Asian American community has no place in this country and must be condemned.""
CAPAC Senators
Senator Tammy Duckworth (IL):
""After Donald Trump repeatedly used his platform to try to racialize this disease, we continue to see a spike in rhetoric and actions against the Asian American community because of misguided fears surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak. We must continue to speak out against these racist acts and those who are stoking these fears about a virus that we know strikes without regard to the color of a person's skin or the language they speak, which is one reason why I'm glad Representative Meng's important resolution passed the House today.""
Senator Mazie K. Hirono (HI):
""This pandemic has exposed just how much work we must do to achieve full equality. Anti-Asian racism and hate crimes are on the rise. Today's vote reaffirms that everyone deserves equal treatment and we must confront discrimination when we see it. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass its own legislation condemning anti-Asian bigotry.""

Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the police department and the sheriff's office to enforce public health guidelines in several Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, where residents often do not wear masks or engage in social distancing. But community leaders said residents have been resisting the guidelines because of hostility towards Mr de Blasio and the growing influence of Donald Trump, whose views on masks and the pandemic have been widely embraced.
The crackdown is occurring shortly before Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar, which begins tonight and it was not immediately clear the impact that the measures might have on the ability of people to gather in synagogues. The health department said that if significant progress towards following guidelines did not occur by Monday, officials could issue fines, limit gatherings or force closings of businesses or schools.
""This may be the most precarious moment we are facing since we emerged from lockdown,"" Dr Dave Chokshi, the city's health commissioner, said at a news conference in South Brooklyn.
Officials this week released statistics showing that the positivity rate in some Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods had grown to anywhere from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, significantly more than the city's overall rate of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. Officials are especially worried about the positivity rates in the Brooklyn neighbourhoods of Borough Park, Midwood and Gravesend, which they have referred to as the ""Ocean Parkway Cluster"".
Mr de Blasio said on Friday, on The Brian Lehrer Show, that the city had closed four yeshivas over violations of social distancing rules.
""There's a very rigorous outreach effort in the community in English and Yiddish,"" the mayor said, adding: ""There's a substantial number of Yiddish speakers who have been brought into the effort. Test and trace has been hiring directly from the community. We are going to keep doing that, though. I think this is an indicator we will be fighting for a little while here.""
The uptick in these neighbourhoods amounts to the first major coronavirus challenge for the city after months of declining or flat infection rates. The concern now is that if the outbreak spreads further in the Orthodox community it could begin to take hold elsewhere, with even more serious consequences. If the city's overall positivity rate hits 3 per cent, that would trigger a new lockdown, including the closing of public schools.
""In the absence of our doing the right thing, we will need to be in a lockdown-type situation as occurred in Israel,"" said Dr Mitchell Katz, head of New York City Health and Hospitals, which is overseeing the city's contact-tracing programme, last week. He was referring to the decision by the Israeli government to reinstitute restrictions because the country is facing the highest rate of new cases per capita in the world.
The distrust of authorities was on display during Friday's news conference in South Brooklyn, at Gravesend Park, which was attended by several city health officials, when one man interrupted Dr Katz by loudly saying the city had been exaggerating the severity of the outbreak.
The scene grew tense when a second man, who was not wearing a mask, approached Dr Katz, who told him to back off or put on a mask. The man shouted that he wouldn't wear a mask and anyone who didn't like it could leave.
""You don't live here,"" he shouted. ""Get out of here."" The man, who wouldn't give his name, soon shouted a racial slur. He also began yelling: ""Go to East New York"", a predominantly black neighbourhood in Brooklyn.
Visits to Borough Park showed how the rules are often ignored. The coronavirus outbreak devastated New York's Orthodox Jewish community in March and April, and community leaders say hundreds have died, including influential religious leaders. But this week, there was hardly a face mask in sight, as if the pandemic had never happened.
At a flower stand in Borough Park on Friday, a vendor, Boris Mushayev, tended to his merchandise as customers around him, all without masks, perused the white, red and orange blooms.
""You have some people here who wear masks but it is true that most people do not,"" said Mr Mushayev. ""I think some people are just not so worried about the virus anymore. If customers want me to wear a mask, I wear it, but for now I have to focus on work.""
Borough Park and Midwood were islands of support for Mr Trump during the 2016 election when the president won 89 per cent of the vote in one local precinct. Many there view him as an ally on issues like school choice, religious freedom and support for Israel, said Avi Greenstein, chief executive of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council.
Those political cross currents had made many here susceptible to ""conflicting information from Washington, where we see a constant downplaying of the crisis and indoor rallies where people may or not be wearing masks,"" Mr Greenstein said.
He added that the political rift had been deepened by what he said were the De Blasio administration's failures.
""For the city to make this deadline on the evening of Yom Kippur is shocking, and what is worse is, community leaders found out about this on Thursday night from a press release,"" said Mr Greenstein. ""That tells you everything you need to know about the story of Borough Park during the pandemic.""
Mr Greenstein contrasted the mayor's approach with a visit to his community centre's offices in January by attorney general William Barr, who used the appearance as the venue to announce federal hate crime charges against a Brooklyn woman accused of assaulting three Orthodox women last December.
""That sent a message to the community, to the entire neighbourhood, very loud and clear: we're here; we're working with you,"" he said. But when it comes to the coronavirus, he added, the neighbourhood was facing a crisis of ""tremendous uncertainty, a tremendous amount of misinformation and a lack of information"".
Yosef Rapaport, a Yiddish podcaster whose brother and brother-in-law both died of Covid-19, said Mr de Blasio needed to rebuild trust with a religious minority that has largely spurned his administration and aligned with Mr Trump.
""This community is being hit by a double whammy: the incompetence of City Hall and the ugliness that is coming from Washington,"" Mr Rapaport said. ""There is a deep, deep mistrust among the community for the intentions of the mayor, especially when the president takes a different approach.""
Dr Katz defended the city's efforts, saying that it had made more than 200,000 public health robocalls to neighbourhoods with significant Orthodox Jewish populations and distributed tens of thousands of masks in Borough Park, Williamsburg, Brighton Beach and Flushing.
The city has also placed ""nearly 60 newspaper ads in community papers to get the word out"" among Hasidic Jews, he said, and talked to 20 synagogue leaders in Borough Park, a neighbourhood with about 300 synagogues, according to Mr Greenstein.
One lingering issue in the city's relationship with Hasidic New Yorkers has been a late-night Twitter outburst by the mayor after he personally oversaw the dispersal of a rabbi's funeral in Williamsburg in April. For many, it validated their fears about the city's leadership.
Jacob Kornbluh, a Hasidic Jew who lives in Borough Park and writes for Jewish Insider, a national publication, summed up a perspective he often hears in the neighbourhood: ""De Blasio became the guy singling out the Jews, so we don't have to listen to him anymore.""
He added that when Mr de Blasio failed to respond similarly to Black Lives Matter protests in June, it deepened people's sense that the government was singling them out.
""Trump speaks their language: distrust in his own government that he leads, distrust in the media,"" Mr Kornbluh said.

143,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-11-20,"1374 words",NA,NA,NA,"The Do-Nothing Congress Did Do Some Things . . .",FALSE,"Albany , NY: New York State Bar Association has issued the following press release:
During the 116th Congress, which lasts from January 3, 2019 to December 31, 2020, Congress passed 169 bills that were signed into law by the President. In terms of context, nearly 16,000 bills were introduced. By these numbers, only roughly 1.25% of bills became law, leading to the nickname “Do-Nothing Congress. ” But to call it that is to discount the value of the legislation that was enacted. In this article, I will highlight several impactful bills that are now the law of the land.
By nature of the political landscape in Washington during the 116th Congress, all bills signed into law were bipartisan. We have had a divided government with the House of Representatives in Democrat control and the Senate and the White House controlled by Republicans. Support by all three is required for enactment.
COVID-19 dominated all aspects of American life in 2020, including Congressional action. While much attention has been paid to relief measures left untouched, there were significant measures enacted early in the pandemic. A trio of measures passed in March, totaling nearly $3 trillion, allotted funds for aid to states, virus testing, enhanced unemployment insurance, nutrition assistance, and an additional $50 million for Legal Services Corporation (LSC). Support of the LSC is a long-standing priority of the Bar. In addition, the legislation created relief programs for sole proprietorships and small businesses in the form of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). Some additional targeted relief measures were passed in the following months, but broader economic relief for states and businesses languished in a partisan battle that was waged on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
The New York State Bar Association weighed in with the Congressional leadership and the New York Congressional delegation on several provisions important to the Association and its members throughout the legislative response to the pandemic process. NYSBA advocated for additional emergency funding for the PPP and EIDL. Many solo practitioners and members in small firms benefited from these targeted relief proposals.
As the pandemic continued and Congress considered additional relief measures, President Karson advocated for student loan relief and increased broadband access. More than 40 million Americans, mostly people under 35 years of age, have student loan debt. An early relief bill provided temporary relief for federal student loan borrowers through September 2020. However, it was evident that more needed to be done, so the Bar urged enactment of legislation that would expand the program to private loans and provide targeted monetary relief in cases of economic hardship.
The pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders have left millions of Americans working, educating, and socializing in a virtual world. It has become abundantly clear that broadband service is an important communications tool which has become vitally necessary for educational purposes, telemedicine, as well as access to justice. NYSBA urged Congress to include appropriate funding for the expansion of a 21st-century digital infrastructure. As of the Election Day, additional relief has not been enacted.
In addition to COVID-related measures, Congress also enacted legislation dealing with veterans, the environment, Holocaust education, older Americans, criminal justice and suicide prevention:
The Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act
This measure directs the Justice Department to coordinate training and grants for states and localities to establish treatment courts for veterans. These specialized courts would serve veterans accused of nonviolent crimes. The courts already exist in many states and typically assist veterans with mental health services, including substance abuse issues. In fact, the first Veterans Treatment Court in the nation was established in the City of Buffalo in 2008. NYSBA, particularly the Committee on Veterans, has been involved with these courts for many years.
Great American Outdoors Act
This monumental legislative package provides over $9 billion over five years in the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for the federal government to acquire new lands for parks and trails; to protect endangered species and threatened forests, and for deferred maintenance for parkland throughout the U.S In New York, the Statue of Liberty would be eligible for maintenance payments. Parkland and open-spaces throughout the state – from the tip of the Sound in Long Island to the top of the mountains in the Adirondacks – would benefit from this measure. It is worth noting that the law required federal agencies to submit to Congress, within 90 days of enactment, a list of shovel-ready deferred maintenance projects. The deadline of November 2, 2020, came and went without such a list. As of this writing, the timing for next steps was unclear.
Never Again Education Act
As the U.S has seen a rise in antisemitism and hate crimes, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation authorizing the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum to use $2 million annually in federal funds to educate teachers on the Holocaust. The measure defines the Holocaust as the “systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder” of six million Jews and other targeted groups, including Roma, Slavs, communists, disabled people, and LGBTQ people. New York is one of only 12 states whose public schools provide education on the Holocaust. The fund from the Act would go to create and improve programs on the history as well as the importance of preventing discrimination, intolerance and genocide. Middle and high school teachers, along with certain prospective teachers, are eligible to participate.
Supporting Older Americans Act
Enacted originally in 1965, the Older Americans Act was created to provide target services for seniors and their caregivers. This historic legislation was reauthorized this year through 2024 and will fund programs for nutritional services (including meal delivery, which is particularly important during the pandemic), disease prevention, caregivers, workforce training regarding elder care, and abuse and neglect prevention services, among other things. Reflective of the times with mandated stay-at-home orders and quarantines, this legislation also directs the Administration on Aging to develop plans and strategies for supporting state and local efforts to address social isolation among older Americans.
The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act
This measure reauthorizes a Justice Department grant that supports state and local law enforcement agencies in analyzing DNA evidence from crimes, including rape kits. Touted as the most important anti-rape legislation by the bill’s sponsor, New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, the law provides much needed resources to local governments and law enforcement agencies for DNA evidence training for health professionals and court, correctional and law enforcement personnel.
The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act
Suicide is a growing public health crisis in America. According to the bill sponsor, Senator Tammy Baldwin, nearly 45,000 Americans die by suicide every year in the U.S This bill creates the special 9-8-8 three-digit hotline, similar to the 9-1-1 emergency line. Currently, suicide prevention crisis numbers are 10 digits, a hurdle to those seeking urgent help. Veterans calling this number will be automatically routed to a line dedicated to support veteran-specific mental health assistance. The bill passed with overwhelming support within Congress and from mental health and veterans groups. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is charged with implementing the system.
As we wrap up the 116th Congress and 2020, we want to look to the 117th Congress and 2021. The Executive Branch will be in the hands of President-elect Joe Biden come January 20, but political control of the Senate remains unresolved, pending two crucial runoff elections in Georgia in early January that could tip the balance of power. .. We hope to know more by then and we will start to wander down a new path and explore the new political topography."

Four white people are charged in the death of 44-year-old Michael Williams, of Grinnell, authorities said Tuesday. No possible motive was given by investigators, though police and the NAACP both sought to assuage concerns that Williams may have been targeted because the Syracuse, New York, native, was Black.
“The investigation has revealed no evidence to show the acts against Michael Williams were motivated by his race nor that his death was the result of a hate crime,” the Iowa Department of Public Safety said in a release.
Still, Grinnell College had canceled classes Monday based on that fear. On Tuesday, Steven Vogel, 31, of Grinnell, was among those arrested in Williams' killing. He is charged with first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse, and police said Williams and Vogel were well acquainted.
It wasn’t immediately known whether Vogel had a lawyer who could comment on his behalf.
Betty Andrews, president of the Iowa-Nebraska NAACP, said during a news conference with police Tuesday that based on the evidence, she also believes there is no indication that Williams was targeted because of his race. However, she said she will evaluate additional evidence as it becomes available.
“Given that the current climate where racial justice is on the front burner for so many ... we understand the fear this kind of incident evokes,” Andrews said.
Investigators said that they believe Vogel strangled Williams on Sept. 12. Willliams' body was wrapped, bound and dumped in a ditch Sept. 16 near Kellogg, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northeast of Des Moines. His body was set on fire and found ablaze after authorities were called that evening about the fire.
The others arrested are Julia Cox, 55, Roy Lee Garner, 57, and Cody Johnson, 29, all of Grinnell. They're each charged with abuse of a corpse, destruction of evidence and accessory after the fact.
Williams' body remained for days in the basement of the home that Vogel, Cox and Garner shared before Vogel, Johnson and Cox moved the body into the ditch, according to police arrest affidavits. Cox and Garner also are accused of trying to get rid of evidence, including bleach bottles, rubber gloves, plastic and plywood, police said.
Online court records for Cox, Garner and Johnson didn't yet list lawyers for them on Wednesday. The case hadn't yet been logged as of Wednesday morning in the online court system for Vogel.
Williams kept in daily contact with his family in Syracuse, his aunt, Paula Terrell, told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. He left his hometown nearly 25 years ago, she said, intent on showing he could live on his own, despite a learning disability. He first moved to Nebraska, then moved to Grinnell, Iowa, about 12 years ago, Terrell said.
Williams’ ex-wife, Sharta Williams, of Kearney, Nebraska, remembered him as personable and loving, and said that he could strike up a conversation with anyone.
“He had such a sense of humor. He was a character,” she said. “If you needed someone to make you laugh, he would be the one to make you laugh.”
Grinnell Police Chief Dennis Reilly called for the community to help Williams’ five children.
“Our mission from the very beginning, and that will continue, is to bring justice for Mike and justice for his family,” Reilly said."

Black Lives Matter protests may be changing that.",FALSE,"Her body was found just days after George Floyd was laid to rest. Nineteen-year-old Oluwatoyin Salau had made a name for herself in Tallahassee, Florida, where she was active in the Black Lives Matter movement and became a prominent voice during protests following Mr. Floyd's death.
Police have arrested Aaron Glee Jr., who according to court documents confessed to kidnapping and murdering both Ms. Salau and fellow activist Victoria Sims. But when Ms. Salau's friends and family gathered in her memory on Saturday, they focused not on the tragedy of her death, but rather the faith and convictions that informed her life.
Those convictions brought her to the forefront of Tallahassee BLM protests, where she espoused an inclusive view of the movement.. ""We are doing this for our brothers and our sisters who got shot,"" she told fellow protesters mourning the killing of Tony McDade, a Black transgender man, in a video widely circulated on social media, ""but we are doing this for every black person."" 
Her inclusive view of the Black Lives Matter movement has drawn attention, as has her Nigerian descent. Among many Black communities in the United States, there's a sense that African-Americans whose forebears were enslaved in the U.S., tolerate new generations of African immigrants to the country. Differences in attitude or lifestyle, at times, has put a wedge in their relationships, leading to suspicion, accusations, and a general sense of incompatibility.
But from Minneapolis and Houston to Boston and New York, generations of African immigrants have begun to raise their voices in unison with their African-American neighbors.
For Herman Ainebyona, a Ugandan living in Massachusetts, the outrage that he feels when he sees a fellow man killed by police knows no nationality. He joined protests in Boston and Worcester because ""loss of life of a human by the knee should be protested against as a basic principle of humanity,"" he says.
After six years living in the U.S., he understands why many African immigrants do not demonstrate, citing ""immigration myths, responsibility burdens, and a way of life for Africans and most immigrants in the United States which make it almost impossible to take part.""
For some African immigrants, the freedom to speak their mind still does not feel theirs to hold.
One woman from East Africa who was interviewed for this story had been made to feel so unwelcome here that she did not feel safe giving her name.
""I have been a victim of great injustice since arriving in the USA,"" she says, ""from being spat at and told to return to Africa while the train is in motion, to being subjected to the most heinous hate-motivated violence that police classified as an ""anti-African"" type of hate-crime against me.""
Hillary Taylor Seguya, a Ugandan graduate student studying international relations at Harvard University, says he joined peaceful protests because ""I wanted to also send a strong message to the world that we are all born free and equal regardless of our skin color.""
He described the demonstrations as ""multi-racial and multi-generational"" and embraces that diversity as a strength. ""I saw many people from Africa participating in Black Lives Matter protests because they face racism too,"" says Mr. Seguya. ""I never felt out of place during the protests because all of us came for a common cause determined to demand for an equal destiny and build a better future free from racism.""
He does not view racism as an exclusively American problem. Uganda, he says, ""has a bad history of racism dating back to 1972 when dictator Idi Amin Dada expelled Asians"" from the country, issuing them a 90 days ultimatum to leave.
Violent police tactics have also been a point of concern in Uganda, adds Mr. Ainebyona. In fact, the death of Mr. Floyd resonated with residents of many African nations, who held their own solidarity marches.
Emamsy Mbossa Ngossoh, a native of the Republic of Congo who recently graduated from Columbia University in New York, says he has a hard time seeing the kind of change currently called for here finding many footholds on the African continent. 
""Unfortunately, African police have excelled in bad practices of beating and hurting helpless people including teenagers and elderly people,"" he says. ""Honestly, police reform will be hard to implement simply because it's linked to the bad governance with corrupted leadership who only seek their interests.""
In that sense, the Black Lives Matter movement, described by many observers as the most racially diverse protest movement in living memory, has transcended the trials of the African-American experience and the United States. Albert Usumanu, a Cameroonian born lawyer who has lived in the U.S. since 1985, hopes that the reach and unified purpose of the movement can be instructive for Africa - and African Americans.
""Our African-American brethren finally believe we all are in the same boat, seeing the reaction of Africans from Ghana [where a ceremony was organized in honor of Floyd] and across the continent as well as Africans right here in America,"" he says. ""We all feel a knee on our neck."""

U.S Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Gary Peters (D-MI), James Lankford (R-OK) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV) sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee today requesting that the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) be adequately funded to meet the needs of at-risk organizations. The funding allocated by this program will support nonprofit organizations most at risk of terror attacks through the acquisition and installation of physical target hardening measures, related preparedness and prevention planning, training and exercises, and contracted security personnel so that religious and community based organizations have the critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property. According to a recent FBI report on hate crime statistics in 2019, 60.3 percent of crimes motivated by anti-religious sentiment were against the Jewish community.
“FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program is vitally important to ensure nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations, have the resources necessary to invest in physical security enhancements, training, and contract security personnel to protect against potential attacks. At a time when we have seen a rise in violence against communities of faith, we have a responsibility to ensure this program is appropriately funded to protect at-risk organizations and communities. I am proud to join my bipartisan colleagues to support this crucial program,” said Senator Portman.
“The rise in anti-semitic and hate-fueled crimes across New York is unconscionable. No community should have to live in fear due to who they are or how they worship,” said Senator Gillibrand. “The Nonprofit Security Grant Program, is an initiative committed to keeping nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist attacks safer through critical investments in their physical security. I will always fight to expand NGSP grants so that New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, can gather communally or worship freely and safely, against the threat of violence. ”
“Places of worship should be a safe haven, and the Nonprofit Security Grant Program is a vital resource for synagogues, mosques and churches that are working to protect their congregations in light of tragic attacks,” said Senator Peters. “I have long championed this program, and I’m proud to join my colleagues to call for robust funding that will help ensure houses of worship, cultural institutions and nonprofit organizations in Michigan and across the country can use this important tool to improve their security and continue serving our communities. ”
“This grant program is vital to ensure faith- and community-based nonprofits and houses of worship can keep people safe as they engage with those they serve,” said Senator Lankford. “As anti-Semitism reached a frightening new high last year, we must continue to find ways to help prevent terrorist acts and also empower our nonprofits to proactively establish safeguards and security measures, which they sadly need to do but don’t necessarily have the funds to fully accomplish without these opportunities for federal assistance. ”
“Anti-Semitic violence in the U.S has grown at an alarming rate,” said Senator Rosen. “Whether it’s in Nevada or in any state across the country, we must stand up against hateful violence. I am proud to join my colleagues in demanding that we properly protect places of worship. I will continue working to ensure the security and safety for Nevadans and all Americans. ”
“Jewish communities worldwide have witnessed firsthand the rise of antisemitism and hate motivated violent attacks. In our schools, synagogues and community centers we have been targeted by hate and extremists and those looking to mimic their disgusting and deplorable tactics,” said Eric Fingerhut, President and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America. “We know that eradicating antisemitism means addressing violent hate and extremism wherever it exits in partnership with our elected officials and law enforcement. For these reasons we thank Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, along with Senators Rob Portman, Gary Peters, James Lankford and Jackie Rosen, for their leadership on urging increased funding this year to meet the growing security needs of nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations. ”
Every year, Congress must specifically allocate funding for the NSGP. The Nonprofit Security Grant Program helps nonprofits, identified by threat assessments to be at risk of attack, plan for and ready themselves against potential attacks. In addition to hardening facilities, this program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration activities between public and private community representatives, as well as with state and local government agencies.
In January, Senator Portman and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) announced that President Trump signed their bipartisan Protecting Faith-Based and Nonprofit Organizations From Terrorism Act into law. This legislation authorizes $75 million annually for five years, from FYs 2020-2024, for NSGP. Under the legislation, funding may be used for target-hardening activities, training for personnel, and any other appropriate activity, as defined by the FEMA Administrator. While the bill authorizes $75 million annually for the program for the next five years, Congress can appropriate more. Portman joined his bipartisan colleagues in December 2019 in requesting that the appropriators fund the program at $90 million. That request was approved and included in the final FY 2020 appropriations agreement.
Read the text of the letter here or below:
Dear Chairmen Shelby and Capito, Vice Chairman Leahy, and Ranking Member Tester,
Thank you for your continued support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) under the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP). As you finalize the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, we respectfully ask you to fund NSGP at the funding level that reflects increased risks to the nonprofit sector. Presently, the House and Senate drafts are far apart on recommended levels of funding for the program. The House top line is $360 million and the Senate’s $90 million. During conference, we urge you to ensure the NSGP is appropriately funded to meet the needs of at-risk populations. At a time of heightened threat to nonprofit faith- and community-based organizations, a bolstered NSGP will continue to provide our nonprofit partners with critical resources and tools they need to protect lives and property.
The NSGP provides for grants to nonprofits deemed at risk of terrorist (or violent extremist) attack, to acquire and install physical security enhancements, conduct preparedness planning, training and exercises, and contract security personnel. The program has improved efforts to keep at-risk nonprofit organizations safe by promoting emergency preparedness coordination and collaboration between public and private community representatives as well as state and local government agencies. Today’s quickly evolving threat environment provides a compelling public interest in protecting against attacks on the nonprofit sector that would disrupt the vital health, human, social, cultural, religious, and other humanitarian services and practices they provide to communities, and which threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans who operate, utilize, live, and work in proximity to them.
At the beginning of this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center jointly assessed that Domestic Violent Extremists and Racially/Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (RMVEs) will continue to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities, particularly the Jewish community, and remain concerned about the difficulty of detecting lone offenders due to the individualized nature of the radicalization process.[1] During a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on threats to the Homeland, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the number one threat the nation faces from domestic violent extremists stems from RMVEs, who are considered the most lethal of all domestic extremists in the post-911 environment.[2] To illustrate his point, Director Wray recounted the arrest last November of Richard Holzer on federal domestic terrorism and hate crime charges for attempting to blow up a historic synagogue in Pueblo, Colorado and provoke “a racial holy war. ”[3]
Additionally, according to the latest FBI Hate Crime Statistics 2019 report,[4] which was released earlier this month, reported hate crimes motivated by religious bias increased by 100 to a total of 1,650 in 2019, of which more than 60 percent were anti-Jewish incidents (a more than 14% increase). Per this reporting, the Jewish community remains the top target of faith-based hate crimes for the 23rd consecutive year.
These assessments underscore the persistent threat of lethal violence and hate crimes against the Jewish community and other faith- and community-based institutions in the United States.
These groups have too frequently been the victim of many different types of violence. At this time of rising concern, FEMA has reported that on average only about one-third of nonprofits seeking critical security investments secure funding, annually.[5] The requests exceed the available resources every year. Yet, in today’s threat environment, demand for NSGP resources is expected to grow substantially more, further widening the needs gap.
Since its inception, the program has maintained bi-partisan, bicameral support as an efficient and effective means to accomplish a great deal of security enhancement and preparedness through modest grants.[6] With this support and for the reasons stated above, we respectfully encourage you to bolster the NSGP funding, so our nation can do all that it can to protect at-risk faith- and community- based nonprofits from increasing extremist and hate-motivated threats.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.
Sincerely,"

Gregory W. Meeks will make history next year by becoming the first Black lawmaker to lead the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He was elected to the job on Thursday by his Democratic peers.
Meeks, an 11-term member from New York, bested two others to win the gavel. Rep. Brad Sherman of California had the most seniority on the committee but dropped out of the race Tuesday after coming in third place in the Democratic Steering Committee's endorsement voting.
Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas, who came in a distant second in Steering Committee votes, stayed in the race even though he was significantly junior in seniority to Meeks and Sherman on the committee.
The final secret ballot vote by the Democratic Caucus on Thursday was 148-78. 
""Serving many years together on the committee, I've seen up close Greg's deep knowledge of foreign policy issues, his profound commitment to an American foreign policy rooted in our values, and his understanding of the importance of Congress's role in these matters,"" outgoing Chairman Eliot L. Engel of New York said in a statement. Engel lost a reelection primary this summer. ""I'm confident that he will also carry forward the committee's tradition of legislating and oversight driven by what's best for American interests, not partisan gain,"" he said.
Though the relatively hawkish Sherman had the most policy experience and Castro enjoyed backing from outside progressive foreign policy groups -- and his comparative youth would have sent a message of generational change -- Democrats chose to elevate Meeks.
The 67-year-old Queens lawmaker is a former New York state assemblyman and city prosecutor. He is generally well-liked within the Democratic Caucus and seen as able to maintain a working relationship with Republicans -- something that is still valued on the historically bipartisan committee.
Both Sherman and Castro congratulated Meeks.
""The Steering and Policy Committee recognized Gregory Meeks's capacity, eloquence, and experience, and the fact that he would make history as the first African American Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee,"" Sherman said in a Tuesday statement.
Castro issued a statement Thursday: ""I look forward to working together with Chairman Meeks, particularly on our common goals such as promoting diversity at the U.S. State Department and rejoining the Iran nuclear deal.""
The elevation of a Black lawmaker to lead the Foreign Affairs Committee -- a role that will see Meeks frequently meet with foreign heads of state, ministers and legislators when they visit Washington -- was also seen as sending an important symbolic message to the world following four years of President Donald Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, a documented steep rise in racially motivated hate crimes and this summer's anti-racism social justice marches.
Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who leads the Middle East subcommittee, in a tweet said he was ""Thrilled for the history making election of @RepGregoryMeeks as HFAC chair! I am proud to join Rep. Meeks as he works to restore American global leadership & smart, strong, diplomacy!""
""In its nearly 200-year-long history, HFAC has had only one chairperson who was not a white man,"" Foreign Policy for America, a progressive organization, said in a statement. ""This mirrors the lack of diversity in State Department leadership, a status quo Rep. Meeks has been vocal about improving upon.""
Meeks is expected to reorient the committee away from its heavy emphasis on Middle East policy, which has preoccupied its work for much of the nearly two decades since the Sept.11 terrorist attacks. His foreign policy experience on the committee has focused on Europe and the Western Hemisphere.
He was previously the top Democrat on the Europe subcommittee before relinquishing that post in order to become the chairman in the 116th Congress of the Financial Services Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions Subcommittee. Meeks is the co-chair of the European Union Caucus and has had leadership roles in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, which is made up of lawmakers from member nations of the Western military bloc.
Meeks serves as the chair or co-chair of multiple congressional caucuses for South American countries, including Peru, Brazil and Colombia, and has participated in multiple congressional trips to the region.

NEW YORK, N.Y - November 18, 2020 - Mariam Rajput, Award-Winning Visual Artist, and Arabic Calligraphist, is pleased to announce the official release of her 2020 Collection; 'The Sea and Its Pearls; A Collection of Works. Rajput's inspiration for this long-awaited collection is derived from Islamic Texts, Persian Poetry, and the beauty of the natural world. Her work tackles a difficult and emotive issue in American Art Culture without being didactic or heavy-handed. The work is neither meant to be a religious lesson or a sermon and provides no answers, but instead creates a contemplative space that encourages the audience to think about the beauty of Islamic Art, Arabic Calligraphy, and Abstract landscapes in a way that engenders a sense of hope and the possibility of change.
The Sea and its Pearls; A Collection of Works will feature 14 conceptual paintings inspired by Quran and Ahadith. The focus of this year's collection of works will be on the abstraction of nature and its values as they're implied behind weighty concepts derived from Holy Texts. Each painting has been hand sketched and drenched in 24k Gold, blends of oil paint, gel mediums, and watercolor pigments. Rajput's ‘The Sea and Its Pearls' was created to carry the concept of peace and self-love; each painting telling the story of hope and inspiration as it was derived from Islamic Texts originating centuries before our time.
Associate Curator for MSA New York, Amirah Hussain states 'There is a remarkable excitement in the art world today for creative visionaries and breakthroughs beyond the conventional definition of ‘Fine Art'. Mariam's paintings are a compelling blend of dynamic color palettes and labor-intensive details, the likes of which have never been presented so harmoniously before. I am excited for what will be an unforgettable encounter with the union of classic Islamic art and contemporary design.
The 2020 Collection will be released on Friday, November 20th, and can be viewed directly on the artist's website; [To enable links contact MENAFN] .

The attack happened Dec. 17 aboard an A train at West 4th St.
A group of three men and three women began haranguing the 32-year-old over her failure to wear a face mask on public transportation. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority requires all subway riders to wear masks.
The encounter escalated, police said, and the group began making “anti-Asian statements relative to the coronavirus” and punched the woman in the face multiple times.
The woman received bruises and was in “substantial pain,” police said, but she refused medical attention.
No arrests have been made in the case.
In September, the U.S. House passed a resolution calling for public agencies to investigate possible hate crimes targeting people of Asian descent after a rise in aggression and violence from those who wrongly blame them for the pandemic."

September 11, 2001, was one of the darkest days in US history and a watershed moment in the global consciousness around the West’s relations with the Muslim world. 
The terror attack on that day, which The New York Times once called “one of the most audacious attacks ever against the United States,” sabotaged the notion of the impregnability of America and violated the honor of a nation envied by friends and foes for its economic strength, political stability, military might and technological supremacy.
The images of the 9/11 attacks, seared into the national collective memory of Americans, immortalized by detailed chronicles of investigative journalists and documentary photographers, might never be consigned to oblivion. The tragedy is certainly one of the most extensively debated events of the 21st century. And it is not only the loss of 2,977 lives or the gigantic economic loss amounting to US$123 billion sustained by the United States that perpetuate its historical impact.
The 9/11 attacks fired up the imagination of a generation of authors, filmmakers and musicians to produce a profusion of books, movies and songs about the disaster, inspired in-depth debate in the media that continues to this day, and even kindled bizarre conspiracy theories that attracted their own partisans. 
But more important, they dislodged the sense of immunity that most Americans had felt for decades while walking down the streets of New York and Washington, DC, believing that the menace of terrorism would never reach the shores of the United States.
As the world’s unchallenged superpower, the response by the United States to the infringement of its national security on that chilling day needed to be decisive and forceful. 
A “war on terror” project was soon set in motion, the Department of Homeland Security was launched tasked with doubling down on the security of the US borders and soil, an array of counterterrorism legislation and executive orders were adopted, and congressional laws have since been capitalized on by three successive commanders-in-chief to deploy troops in at least 18 countries. 
Some 7,052 Americans in uniform have been killed since, and 53,244 others wounded.
Brown University estimates that the cost of the war on terror had exceeded $5.4 trillion by 2019, and researchers believe the United States will dedicate a further $1 trillion over the course of the next 40 years to look after the veterans of what some see as a neocolonial campaign.
The contagion effects of the war on terror, however, should be tracked in territories that actually had no role in that massive act of inhumanity on September 11, 2001. 
The 9/11 hijackers were 19 al-Qaeda affiliates from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Egypt. But in retribution for their felonious escapade, embodying the vile thirst of a notorious gang for spreading havoc, it was an entire religion that became the target of a relentless smear campaign, and the Muslim world as a whole was villainized – a misguided venture that is still in progress and hasn’t made America safer.
In September 2001, al-Qaeda had fewer than a hundred members, but at its strongest in 2019, it boasted some 40,000 recruits. Although it seems to be in disarray now, al-Qaeda hasn’t vanished, and US State Department officials admit it is more powerful than before.
The war on terror never exterminated al-Qaeda and its spin-offs across the Middle East and North Africa in their entirety. Nor did it root out the pernicious ideology of the death squad that continues to enthrall young men who were not even born yet on September 11, 2001, to see with their own eyes how violent extremism can ruin lives and entangle the world in insecurity. 
This costly campaign, which is believed to have displaced upward of 37 million people globally, hasn’t been able to prevent ISIS, the newest incarnation of a consistent thread of global terrorism, from becoming a launching pad of violent attacks throughout the region, either.
The way the US government responded to the 9/11 attacks in rhetoric and action, and the reflection of that disturbing episode in the US media, turbocharged a thrust of anti-Muslim prejudice that had existed in the public sphere in America previously, but needed a stimulus to come to the surface, and found that impetus in the polarization of American society along religious and racial divides after the September 11 events.
According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, in 2000, only 33 offenses motivated by anti-Muslim bias were reported. In a significant departure from the pre-9/11 trends, UCR revealed that 27.2% of all hate crimes reported in 2001, namely 546 incidents, were anti-Muslim, and this includes 455 anti-Muslim hate crimes that occurred after the 9/11 attacks.
An inflammatory discourse on “Islamic terrorism” was triggered, and Muslims everywhere found themselves receiving angry looks, presumed to be the culprits behind the desecration of the integrity and security of America, the torchbearer of the free world.
It took less than five months for then-president George W Bush to float the idea of an “Axis of Evil” in his 2002 State of the Union address, comprising Iran, Iraq and North Korea. These rogue states, according to the president, were outposts of criminality harboring malevolent ambitions to produce weapons of mass destruction and sponsor global terrorism.
Yet to this day, no evidence has ever been produced substantiating the idea that any of those three countries were involved in the 9/11 attacks.
The Iranian what ifs
Three years after the 9/11 saga, Bush conceded that the Central Intelligence Agency had found no links between Iran and the suicide hijackings. 
And this year, Western media played down US Vice-President Mike Pence’s allegations that the deceased commander of Iran’s Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, had helped the 9/11 terrorists travel to Afghanistan as a “conspiracy theory,” reminding him of the 9/11 Commission’s independent conclusion that it had “found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.”
That said, the seismic change the 9/11 calamity precipitated was that the US political and intelligence elites had found a new scoundrel to blame indiscriminately for the entirety of the security challenges facing America: Islam and Muslim-majority countries subscribing to sharia laws, including Iran.
Regardless of whether or not Islamic teachings were genuinely the motivation of those 19 brainwashed, callous terrorists who committed the attacks, a new, gloomy era in the relationship between the United States and the Muslim world was initiated, characterized by mutual cynicism, fear, tensions and unbridgeable gaps.
Muslim-baiting tropes became a fixture of newspapers and TV stations, Islamophobic bombast by politicians and public-officer holders morphed into the new normal and even a plus for appealing to a resentful electorate nationwide, and anti-Muslim discrimination and hate crimes were stitched into the fabric of daily life.
Iranians paid a heavy price for the outpouring of anti-Muslim rage that followed the 9/11 attacks. Unable to point the finger of accusation at a traditional, stalwart ally – Saudi Arabia – that was the birthplace of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the plane hijackers, as well as the provenance of Sunni extremism, the US government diverted the victimizing narrative toward Iran, which it termed the world’s leading state sponsor of terror.
It became quite accepted and customary for American politicians and mainstream media to refer to Iranians as terrorists. Two examples are President Donald Trump calling Iran the “number one nation of terror” in 2019, and a “terrorist nation” one year before that.
This sort of hate-mongering, partly the outcome of the deterioration of Iran-US relations following the 1979 revolution and partly the upshot of the post-9/11 feelings against Muslims and Islamic nations, emboldened white supremacists and alt-right nationalists, both in the United States and internationally, to target Iranians, harass and disparage them and call them terrorists in hate crimes that can have immeasurable traumatic impacts on the victims.
In one case last year, an Iranian refugee in Portland, Oregon, Hasel Afshar, who is a member of Baha’i faith, returned home from a trip to Canada, to find his apartment assaulted and vandalized with hate-filled graffiti, including one in which it was written on a wall in one of the rooms in large red letters “f*ck you terrorist.” In some of the graffiti, he was called a Muslim terrorist, whereas he is actually not a Muslim.
A comprehensive risk analysis by the Cato Institute found in 2019 that in the time period 1975 to 2017, foreign-born terrorists who entered the United States as refugees, students, visitors, asylum-seekers or workers killed a total of 3,037 people on the US soil, accounting for 86% of all murders caused by terrorists. 
Within this timeframe, “zero” people were killed by “Iranian terrorists,” while terrorists of Lebanese origin killed 157 people and terrorists of Emirati origin murdered 313 citizens. The inventory even lists eight people killed by Uzbek nationals.
Throughout the years that have elapsed since the 9/11 attacks, many Iranians have been asking valid questions about their standing in the world, global perceptions of their country and the reason they have been put on a trial of isolation and vilification by the United States.
What if 15 of the 19 assailants of the September 11 cataclysm had been Iranians? What if the Boston Marathon bombing perpetrators had been Iranians? What if the deadly San Bernardino attack of 2015 had been pulled off by a green-card-holding Iranian couple?
These what ifs, and tens of questions along the same lines, continue to be asked by Iranians, who believe they don’t deserve to be eschewed and slandered, when in fact they are a nationality with a revered culture, and ambitions for a more prosperous, democratic future. These are questions, the posing of which unveils the grievances of a nation at being viewed and treated with suspicion, frequently misunderstood as ripe for radicalism and a source of global instability, in sharp contrast to what it actually stands for.
The evidence is clear that the United States will never eradicate global terrorism by going down the path of persistently defaming an entire faith and shutting the doors on any opening for dialogue with a nation that sits at the crossroads of Western and Eastern culture and history. 
Fighting terrorism needs acquiring a clear understanding of the roots of this global threat, investing on the right priorities and engaging with all stakeholders that have an interest in preventing further al-Qaeda- and ISIS-like cults from emerging.

154,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-07-10,"1296 words","OPINION","Erik Nielson",NA,"If We Silence Hate Speech, Will We Silence Resistance?",FALSE,"“Hate” is a dangerously elastic label. And it has long been used to demonize unpopular expression, particularly among people of color. 
Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and most other major internet distributors took a bold step this week when they all but banned content from Infowars, a website run by the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The tech companies cited their policies against hate speech for their decision, rather than the trafficking in fake news by Infowars. 
It’s tempting to applaud this move, but we should be wary. While Mr. Jones’s rhetoric is certainly repugnant, mounting pressure from the political left to censor hateful speech may have unintended consequences, especially for people of color. 
That’s because “hate” is a dangerously elastic label, one that has long been used in America to demonize unpopular expression. If we become overzealous in our efforts to limit so-called hate speech, we run the risk of setting a trap for the very people we’re trying to defend.
History offers countless examples. Consider black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s. Impatient with the lack of progress for African-Americans after the civil rights movement, leaders like Malcolm X routinely inveighed against white America using inflammatory rhetoric. He had no trouble expressing animosity toward the “white devil,” and he contemplated violent resistance.
That put him in the cross hairs of law enforcement, most notably J. Edgar Hoover’s F.B.I. Of course, the FBI spied on many other so-called black radicals. Under Hoover’s Counterintelligence Program, groups like the Nation of Islam and the Black Panthers were subject to routine surveillance, harassment and even violence. Hoover’s justification? He labeled them hate groups. It was a cynical but effective way to turn the tables, framing them as antagonists in the centuries’ long struggle for racial equality. 
Hoover is gone, but the tendency to label black radical organizations as hate groups persists, even among groups with more admirable intentions. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist and hate organizations across the country, makes the dubious claim that nearly 25 percent of the 954 “hate groups” they follow are “black nationalist” groups. 
There’s no question that black nationalists often argue for racial separation or that many have engaged in bigotry. But it’s false equivalence to label black nationalists and white supremacists alike as hate groups. Doing so ignores the centuries of racial terror that gave rise to black nationalism, as well as the power imbalance that keeps it alive. And it gives a powerful tool to people who want to silence radical perspectives. They can call these viewpoints hate speech.
Take, as one example, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, a Palestinian-led initiative that endorses a series of nonviolent measures to end Israel’s systematic oppression of the Palestinians. As it has gained traction in the United States, in large part because of support from prominent African-American intellectuals and organizations, state and federal lawmakers have increasingly tried to shut the movement down by accusing it of hate speech.
The New York State Senate, for example, recently passed a bill that would prohibit from receiving public funds “student organizations that participate in hate speech, including advocating for the boycott, divestment and sanctions of Israel and American allied nations.” Meanwhile, Congress (with support from many Democrats) has been trying to criminalize the movement for years. 
If people engaged in a boycott can be silenced, even criminalized, for discriminating against the group they accuse of discrimination, we begin to see how problematic it is to punish “hate” speech. It can devolve into the politics of choosing sides, and that is usually bad news for people who lack political clout to begin with.
Black Lives Matter would know. A movement formed in response to police violence against African-Americans, it has been accused by law enforcement officials, and even some state legislators, of being a hate group, despite the fact that it renounces violence and welcomes allies from all walks of life. 
By accusing Black Lives Matter of peddling hate, politicians effectively turned the tables on the movement, allowing lawmakers, in some cases, to strengthen protections for the police. Since 2016, several “Blue Lives Matter” bills have been enacted across the country, many of which seek to add police as a protected class covered by hate crimes laws. Following this logic, Black Lives Matter’s opposition to police brutality is a kind of hate itself, from which the police require additional protection. Yet killings by police officers are increasing while line-of-duty deaths of police officers are decreasing.
It is difficult to imagine a more ridiculous outcome. But it speaks to one of the most serious perils of limiting speech: a measure to protect minority perspectives can instead be used to further marginalize them. 
Despite this, a significant number of young Americans, especially young Americans of color, believe that hate speech should be limited by the government or on college campuses. In addition, some scholars have recently argued for legal restrictions on hate speech.
But how would stronger limits on hate speech affect progressive protests against white supremacy? What would have been the fate, for example, of the historic Million Man March in 1995, an event organized by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan? The Nation of Islam is a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group, and Mr. Farrakhan has openly made anti-Semitic comments for years. At the same time, the March was a landmark effort focused on uniting black men in the face of widespread inequality and racism. 
What about the equally historic Women’s March in 2017, after it was revealed that some of the event’s most prominent organizers had ties to Mr. Farrakhan? Or that they openly revered Assata Shakur, a black revolutionary who was convicted (albeit questionably) of killing a police officer and is now on the F.B.I.’s list of most-wanted terrorists? Predictably, they have been accused by some of embracing hate, yet they organized one of the most significant protests in United States history.
If we allowed these voices to be silenced on grounds that they promote hate, we’d find ourselves scrambling to defend the radical poets, musicians, filmmakers and other artists who have pushed the boundaries of expression into what could arguably amount to hate speech, but who have done so from the vanguard of social and political protest. 
That almost certainly explains the response from the music industry when Spotify announced its decision to stop promoting artists who engage in hateful speech or conduct. A number of people, including representatives from Kendrick Lamar’s record label, Top Dawg Entertainment, expressed concerns that such a policy would lead to censorship and threatened to pull their music from the service. 
Within weeks, Spotify reversed course, noting that its policy was “vague.” But by silencing Mr. Jones on its platform, it’s not exactly clear where Spotify is drawing the line.
And that’s the inherent danger in attempting to limit something like hate. It can be so broadly defined that our efforts to counteract it will be broad, too. 
If that happens, we risk silencing the voices and perspectives we can least afford to lose. That’s not a triumph over hate. That’s falling victim to it.

""So don't worry, I'm still here,"" Singh told the small rally. ""I'm still working for you [to] bring you good food.""
Unsolicited GoFundMe efforts have raised more than $120,000 for the Sikh family, enough to cover repairs of the damaged kitchen and dining areas, and replace the bottles of wine, tables, glassware and dishes that were shattered.
Current online campaigns have raised $71,000, and a campaign that fellow Indian restaurant Paper Dosa just finished raised almost $57,000.
A few people launched online fundraisers without asking the Singhs, who decided to let them do it, said Cameron Brown, a friend of the family, in an interview before the rally.
A contractor will begin repair work Saturday, Brown said.
The Singhs expect to have enough of the repairs completed in a week and will then begin to offer takeout and delivery, Brown said. They can't open for dining until their chef returns from India, he added. The chef is unable to leave because of that country's surging COVID-19 outbreak.
Police have called the destruction of the restaurant a hate crime because of the racist graffiti spray-painted inside.
Santa Fe police Chief Andrew Padilla said there is some video footage of the crime that will be released publicly in the hope that someone can identify the vandal.
The incident also prompted state Attorney General Hector Balderas to renew his call for the Legislature to revise anti-domestic terrorism and hate crime statutes as well as fund a special unit in his office to investigate and prosecute such crimes.
""Domestic terrorism harms individual Americans and intimidates entire communities, and we must immediately address this problem before it gets worse,"" Balderas said in a statement. ""I stand with the victims of this heinous attack, and will continue to fight to protect New Mexican families from this violence.""
State officials who spoke at Wednesday's event said they were appalled by the attack on India Palace. A few noted that sometimes it takes an ugly crime to bring people together.
""This deplorable act is not New Mexico,"" said State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard. ""So today I hope you receive a message from your fellow New Mexicans that we will not tolerate these acts. That is not us.""
State Rep. Andrea Romero, D-Santa Fe, expressed sympathy for the Singhs but also for a criminal who could be driven by such hatred.
""How is it that we have this kind of pain in our community that folks want to express that in such a hateful way?"" Romero said.
Brown said people from as far away as Chicago and New York have joined locals in offering to help, which has comforted the Singhs after the disturbing incident.
On the flip side, some people are still saying in social media posts they believe the break-in and vandalism were faked, Brown said.
""Just the normal, Trump-supporting people that say it's a hoax,"" he said.
The words ""Trump 2020"" were spray-painted along with racial epithets across walls and paintings.
One man posted on social media that the attack was against the former owner, but the person he named was actually a former manager, Brown said.
Brown said he was able to pressure the man into taking down his posts.
The ferocity of the attack is hard to shake, Singh said.
He said he'll never forget seeing all the glassware shattered, the hateful graffiti defacing the expensive paintings, the computers gone and the sense of violation.
Motioning to his head, Singh said, ""I'm still not feeling good, still not feeling well.""
But he said he appreciates the outpouring of sympathy that will help his family recover, both financially and emotionally.
""I promise I'm coming back,"" he said."

These curriculum changes encourage students to contemplate how prejudice toward and discrimination of marginalized groups of people remain infused into many aspects of our present-day world. They prioritize honest discussions about race. 
Yet even as inclusion becomes a higher priority than ever before, there is great risk that teaching about the dangers of antisemitism will fall by the wayside. Excluding antisemitism from this wave of anti-prejudice teaching would be a grave mistake.
 The subjugation of African-Americans is a unique stain on American society, and it deserves thorough treatment in American schools. I am not inviting relativistic comparisons between the African-American story (or any other minority group's story) and the Jewish story; I am only suggesting that each of these stories deserves to be told. The Jewish people have faced rampant and often deadly antisemitism in every generation and all over the world. 
American schoolchildren should know.
Antisemitism is easily recognizable when a shooter targets a synagogue in Pittsburgh, an attacker stabs a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Monsey, or a vandal draws swastikas on playgrounds. But these heinous tragedies are often written off as rare occurrences, when in fact antisemitism is far more pervasive.
I am not an educator and know little about designing school curriculums. But I am a third-generation Holocaust survivor. I am also a former prosecutor. And in that role, I learned both about how the justice system disproportionately affects black and brown people, and how hate crimes embody a special type of evil. Antisemitic hate crimes reported to the FBI rose by 40% from 2014 to 2018. And of the 364 hate crimes reported in New York in 2019, 148 targeted Jewish people. These are staggering numbers.
Crime is not the only way that antisemitism surfaces today. College students have increasingly experienced antisemitism on campus – mainly in the form of open and outspoken anti-Zionism, which more often than not is a thinly veiled disguise for antisemitism. Separately, some people have blamed the Jews (without any logic or proof) for the global coronavirus outbreak. As a result, antisemitism cannot be dismissed as merely a relic of our history books.
Yet to understand the antisemitism of today, educators must present antisemitism's history. Without exploring past persecution, we cannot expect schoolchildren to recognize the warning signs of rising antisemitism today or in the future.
NEW RACE-CONSCIOUS lesson plans will generally include topics like the theft of Native American land and culture, the Jim Crow era, and the Japanese internment camps. In that spirit, these lesson plans should also include the slaughter of the Jews in Russian pogroms, the systematic murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust, and the widespread housing and university admissions discrimination against American Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries, as a start.
School lesson plans should not separate distinct racial groups and draw distinct lessons from each episode of discrimination explored. Instead, the plight of various racial groups should be taught in a way that recognizes the overlapping features and patterns of discrimination so that schoolchildren can identify them when they come across them in their own lives. 
The fact that Jewish persecution is the world's oldest and most geographically widespread form of hatred is instructive: Antisemitism is a mutable virus, and its many mutations and various chapters each carry valuable lessons about prejudice, hate and race relations.
Many school districts and private institutions throughout the country have quickly responded to this spring and summer's uproar over racial injustice by already incorporating race relations lessons into their curriculums this fall. Others have not yet done so, but are considering doing so in the future.
There is danger in antisemitism being excluded (or demonized) in these new curriculum changes, as was the case in California's first ethnic studies plan. The California plan valorized the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (an organized boycott of Israeli goods and services) and painted Israelis as colonizers. 
It also presented the ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" (a group known for preaching antisemitism) as an important religious movement to cover. Moreover, while an entire lesson plan was devoted to Islamophobia in the United States, there was not even a definition of antisemitism to be found in the glossary. The curriculum seemed to include every minority group except the Jews.
Many people today believe that antisemitism is separate from and less insidious than classic racism, but it is one of the world's oldest and deepest forms of hatred. American schools must understand it as such to ensure that the next generation can recognize, define and reject antisemitism going forward.
As we rework school curriculums to be more inclusive, please do not exclude antisemitism.

157,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","CNN Wire",2020-10-21,"644 words",NA,NA,NA,"San Francisco's 'CAREN Act,' making racially biased 911 calls illegal, is one step closer to becoming a law",FALSE," (CNN) -- It may soon be illegal to make discriminatory, racially biased 911 calls in San Francisco.
The ""CAREN Act"" (Caution Against Racially Exploitative Non-Emergencies) was introduced in July at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting by Supervisor Shamann Walton. 
The ordinance is one step closer to becoming a law. On Tuesday, the board unanimously passed the act on first read. Next week, the bill has to be voted on again by the board, and then it will be sent to Mayor London Breed to sign.
The ordinance's name is a twist on ""Karen,"" the name social media gives people making racially biased 911 calls. 
And it's not just ""Karen."" There are also names like ""Becky,"" which has also come to symbolize a stereotype of whiteness. And ""Susan."" And ""Chad.""
The ""CAREN Act"" has been met with support and opposition since it was proposed. Several residents wrote letters to the board urging them to reconsider renaming the ordinance, citing it is sexist and targets people with the name of ""Karen.""
""The name of the act places a target on my name as a racist and I am not,"" one resident wrote in a letter to the board. ""By associating the name 'Caren' or anyone elses name with such a law, really is offensive.""
""I do not have objection to this act; the issue it is trying to address is wrong,"" wrote another resident. "" I do strongly object to the the name. The insensitive choice of many people to use the name Karen as a general purpose term of disapproval for middle age white women needs to stop."" 
The ordinance is similar to the statewide AB 1550 bill introduced by California Assemblyman Rob Bonta, making it unlawful and accountable for a caller to ""fabricate false racially biased emergency reports."".
""Using 911 as a tool for your prejudice towards marginalized communities is unjust and wrong!"" Bonta tweeted. 
Racially motivated 911 calls aren't a new occurrence across the country, in spite of a recent uptick following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Earlier this summer, a White hotel employee in North Carolina called the police on a guest, a Black woman and her children, who were using the hotel's swimming pool. And in May, a White woman called 911 on a Black man who was birdwatching in New York's Central Park. 
Bonta said the intent of AB 1550 isn't to discourage Californians in real danger from calling 911.
""This bill could protect millions of Californians from becoming targets of hate and prevent the weaponization of our law enforcement against communities of color,"" he said in an online release. 
""Racist false reports put people in danger and waste resources,"" the ordinance's co-author, Supervisor Matt Haney, tweeted. 
Though making a false police report is a misdemeanor or felony offense in many states, including California, accountability is lacking for making racially biased calls to law enforcement.
Other cities have already begun the process to pass similar legislation.
Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price introduced a similar motion to the City Council in June exploring ""criminal penalties, rights of victims to bring private civil actions and cost recovery by the City,"" he tweeted.
In 2019, the City Commission in Grand Rapids, Michigan, held a public hearing on a ""proposed human rights ordinance"" criminalizing racially motivated calls to 911 with a fine of up to $500. 
In 2018, former New York state Sen. Jesse Hamilton proposed a bill after a woman called 911 on him for campaigning, that would require the local district attorney to investigate these incidents as hate crimes. If the calls were deemed racially motivated, a number of consequences such as fines, sensitivity training or jail time would be issued.

163,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-06-18,"851 words","STYLE","Julia Carmel",NA,"Opal Lee’s Juneteenth Vision Is Becoming Reality",FALSE,"The 94-year-old activist and lifelong Texan has campaigned to make June 19 a national holiday for years.
This article was published in 2020 and was updated on June 18 to reflect President Biden’s signing of a bill that made Juneteenth a federal holiday.
When Opal Lee was growing up in Texas, she would spend Juneteenth picnicking with her family, first in Marshall, where she was born, then in Sycamore Park in Fort Worth, near the home she moved into at age 10.
She and her family lived in a predominantly white neighborhood in Fort Worth. When Mrs. Lee was 12, a mob of 500 white supremacists set fire to her home and vandalized it. The structure was destroyed, and no arrests were made.
Experiencing that hate crime pushed Mrs. Lee into a life of teaching, activism and, eventually, campaigning. In 2016, at the age of 89, she decided to walk from her home in Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., in an effort to get Juneteenth named a national holiday. She traveled two and a half miles each day to symbolize the two and a half years that Black Texans waited between when Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, on Jan. 1, 1863, abolishing slavery, and the day that message arrived in Galveston, where Black people were still enslaved, on June 19, 1865.
As Mrs. Lee approached 93 last year, Fort Worth celebrated Juneteenth with multiple days of festivities, including a parade, a walk/run 5K, a breakfast of prayer, art exhibits, a gospel festival and the Miss Juneteenth Pageant.
This year, as Black Lives Matter protests continue across the country, many companies have decided to make Juneteenth a day off for employees. New York and Virginia have announced that they plan to make Juneteenth a paid holiday for state employees, and Mrs. Lee’s vision is closer than ever to its realization.
On June 17, 2020, The New York Times spoke to Mrs. Lee about what makes this year different and what she hopes will come of this moment. A year later, Mrs. Lee appeared at the White House to watch President Biden sign a bill that made June 19 a national holiday.
What is your first memory of celebrating Juneteenth?
It was in Marshall, Texas, where I was born. We’d go to the fairgrounds to celebrate. It was like going to Christmas or Thanksgiving, we had such a good time.
Some people still compare Independence Day to Juneteenth. How would you explain the type of freedom and community that comes from celebrating Juneteenth?
The difference between Juneteenth and the 4th of July? Woo, girl! The fact is none of us are free till we’re all free. Knowing that slaves didn’t get the word for two and a half years after the emancipation, can’t you imagine how those people felt? They’d been watching — that’s what they call Watch Night services — every New Year’s, thinking freedom was coming. And then to find out they were free, even two and a half years after everybody else.
So, the 4th of July? Slaves weren’t free. You know that, don’t you? And so we just celebrate the hell out of the 4th of July, so I suggest that if we’re going to do some celebrating of freedom, that we have our festival, our educational components, our music, from June the 19 — Juneteenth — to the 4th of July. Now that would be celebrating freedom.
How do you think the protests for Black lives that are happening around the country have shaped the way that people understand Juneteenth?
We have simply got to make people aware that none of us are free until we’re all free, and we aren’t free yet. There’s so many disparities. You know, we need some decent education and some decent jobs that pay money, and we need health care and all kinds of things and if people would just get together and address these disparities, we’d be well on our way to being the greatest country in the world.
Right now lots of companies are making Juneteenth an official holiday. How does it feel to see your vision coming to fruition?
Ooh girl, I could do a holy dance. I’m so happy to see things coming to fruition and the fact that we are almost there making it a holiday. We started out talking about 100,000 signatures and now we’re saying let’s take a million signatures to Congress to let them know that it’s not just one little old lady in tennis shoes.
I hope they understand that we’re talking about a holiday like Presidents’ Day or Flag Day. We’re not talking about a paid holiday. However, I’m delighted to have the big companies give their employees the day off with pay.
What changes do you hope to see in our country beyond having Juneteenth recognized on a national level?
If we would unify, if we would get together and do something about homelessness, and do something about people having decent housing, and decent food, and they would have not only a place to stay but a decent education.
If we could just love one another, you know? If you could get past the color of my skin and love me like you do that boy next door to you.

Charles E. Schumer issued the following press release:
During Schumer's 1998 Senate Election, He Vowed To Visit Every Single New York County Each Year-At The Close Of 22 Years, Even As A Pandemic Rocks Our Nation, The Tradition Continues
As Senate Democratic Leader And During A Pandemic, Schumer Has Always Staunchly Believed That Visiting Every Single NY County Is Imperative To His Daily Work In U.S. Capitol, This Year - As New York Faced Unimaginable Hardships - It was More Important Than Ever Before; Vows To Continue This Tradition In 2021
Even a year as tumultuous as 2020, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Senate Democratic Leader, today completed his 22nd consecutive tour of all 62 New York State counties-an accomplishment that continues his track record as the first New York State public official to visit every single county in New York each year he has been in office.
Over the course of the year, Schumer made 86 county visits to Upstate New York and Long Island. He visited counties in the Capital Region 15 times; Western New York 6 times; Central New York 8 times; the Rochester-Finger Lakes 12 times; the Southern Tier 10 times; the Hudson Valley 14 times; the North Country 8 times; and Long Island 13 times.
""22 years ago, upon my election to the United States Senate in 1998, I promised that each and every year I served, I would visit all 62 of New York State's diverse counties. Not only has this ritual remained a steadfast passion of mine because of all I learn from my constituents and bring to Washington, D.C. as both a senator and the Democratic Leader of the Senate,"" said Senator Schumer. ""Especially this year, when New York battled the global health and economic pandemic especially hard,visiting all 62 counties was vital for me to learn firsthand the struggles and needs of New Yorkers, from one end of the state to the other. Through a year that much has changed - I, too, traveled with masks and disinfectant in tow to much smaller and more understated events - one thing remained the same: my commitment, dedication, and love for New York. This year, more than ever before, I learned more about the struggles and needs of New York and saw New Yorkers resilience, perseverance, and grit and time and time again the very best New York has to offer even during our darkest of days.""
Schumer added, ""Although I've gained the title of Senate Democratic Leader, my proudest and most principal titles have been, and will always remain, New York's Senator and 'New Yorker.' At the close of twenty-two years, my beliefs are as clear as ever: 'Senators who stay in Washington and never return home are simply not doing their job.' Although this year looked a little different with online or-socially distanced events and celebrations, that's why I safely go to all of the places that I can. Whether I'm celebrating a virtual high school graduation or fighting for our first responders all over the state, I'm always learning more about New York directly from my constituents.""
Some of the key highlights include:
New York State
Delivered $167 Billion For New York In COVID Relief: During negotiations for the CARES Act, Schumer worked for days to deliver a plan that best protected New York's workers, small businesses, and health centers so they could receive the help they needed amidst the COVID crisis. The CARES Act Included:
Secured Nation's First Major Disaster Declaration for COVID-19, Unlocking Almost $6 billion In Federal FEMA Support for New York State: Following Schumer's tireless advocacy and early calls for broad federal support from FEMA, New York State was granted the first Major Disaster Declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic of any state in the country. Schumer has continued to push the Administrator and the President to provide all support available to New York under FEMA's control, delivering almost $6 billion for the state thus far, with over $1 billion in reimbursement for COVID-19 costs incurred by the state, localities, and eligible non-profits, like purchasing personal protective equipment and paying health care workers overtime.
Secured Over $6 Billion In FMAP Funds For NYS And Its Counties To Provide Vital Budget And Health Care Relief: Senator Schumer successfully pushed for Congress to include a cost-sharing provision in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act so New York's counties, which pay part of Medicaid's costs, could benefit from the increase federal Medicaid support. Schumer had successfully championed this provision in prior disaster response legislation, including after 9-11, Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 financial meltdown. The legislation immediately unlocked over $6 billion in state-wide dollars related to healthcare funds known as 'FMAP' for New York state and its countiesto cover healthcare costs, $1 billion in unemployment benefits, free testing, pair emergency leave, meals for homebound seniors, and other critical services.
Fighting Hunger By Securing Pandemic-EBT Program Extension through September 2021: After tirelessly advocating for expanded nutrition benefits, Senator Schumer secured numerous nutrition benefits in the negotiations for the Continuing Resolution. The Continuing Resolution extended P-EBT benefits through September 30, 2021 and creates a pathway to allow territories to participate in the P-EBT program.

LONG ISLAND
Delivered Historic $2.6 Billion Federal Investment To Construct World First Electron Ion Collider At Brookhaven National Lab On Long Island: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine that would allow scientists to look inside the building blocks of an atom. In 2018 Senator Schumer, a long time benefactor of BNL, urged the Department of Energy to construct a U.S.-based EIC after a National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine published a report urging immediate action to advance fundamental research into nuclear physics as a national security interest. Sen. Schumer spearheaded Congressional commitment to advancing scientific research by using his role as Democratic Leader to ensure that DOE had enough funding to advance the construction of an EIC to the solicitation phase. DOE issued a request for proposals for construction of the EIC triggering a competition between BNL and Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). Senator Schumer successfully made the case to DOE that BNL's track record in constructing large user facilities of national significance like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) made them the ideal choice for the EIC. In early 2020, DOE announced that it had chosen BNL's proposal and would begin the process of providing funds to BNL beginning the design phase of this $2.6 billion atom smasher.
Steered Course Correction By U.S. Navy To Proactively Clean Up The Toxic Grumman Plume; Secured Navy Commitment To Finally Intercept Ever Expanding Plume After 20 Year Fight: The Navy-Grumman Plume is a 3,000+ acre mass of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emanating from the former Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) and Grumman facilities in Bethpage which specialized in aviation, weapons and space exploration manufacturing from the 1930s to 1998. Schumer long championed the position that the state and the Navy should be working to ""hydraulically contain"" and remove the ever expanding plume from Long Island's sole source aquifer rather than focusing on its practice of ""wellhead treatment"" which addressed the problem on the surface but ignored the swiftly metastasizing chemicals underneath. For twenty years Senator Schumer advanced the ball by pushing the United States Geological Survey and later, the Navy to fully map the plume through federal legislation. With this new data secured by Senator Schumer, state health regulators realized that containment was possible and began working on a plan to contain the plume. At first recalcitrant, after Schumer's urging, the Navy began to work with the state on a plan to try to contain the ever expanding plume. In late 2020, Navy announced that they had developed a plan to intercept migrating plume, Navy would construct extraction wells along the Southern State Parkway to intercept plume before it reaches south shore communities like Massapequa and the Great South Bay.

In 2019, after passage of the act, Schumer worked directly with the DOE Secretary to ensure Congress adequately funded DOE to swiftly establish the National QIS Centers while simultaneously urging him to consider BNL as one of the three sites based off of their achievements in advancing our knowledge of QIS. In early 2020, DOE announced up to $625 million over five years to fund five Quantum Research Centers including the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage at Brookhaven National Labs.
Sounded The Alarm On Vital Equipment Taken Off Fire Island Post-Sandy Project And Moved To Project One-Mile From Mar-A-Lago: Schumer has long-fought for federal funding to shore up costal storm protections for communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy, including the Fire Island and Moriches Inlet project off of Long Island. Part-way through the construction work to replenish beaches this year and protect residents from future storm threats, the vitally needed dredging equipment-one of just a handful off the Atlantic Coast-was pulled off the project to complete another beach dredging project at Midtown Beach in Palm Beach County, Florida-a beach that already has a sea wall and sits just a mile from Mar-A-Lago-before turtle nesting season. Schumer called for an explanation of the decision and commitment that the dredging ship would return to Long Island on time to complete its New York work. After sounding the alarm and staying on top of the Army Corps in subsequent months, the dredge was returned to Long Island on time to resume its emergency coastal protection work.

Turn to the conversation this morning Dagen McDowell, Michael Lee and Steve Forbes, it is great to see everybody this morning.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Great to see you.
STEVE FORBES, EDITOR IN CHIEF OF FORBES: Good to be here, thank you.
BARTIROMO: And some of the top stories that we are watching this morning, the U.S. has crossed a grim new milestone in the coronavirus pandemic with nearly 3 million confirmed cases. One bright spot, the death toll is steadily declining. Infections are on the rise though in 40 states as Texas, Arizona and California report record hospitalizations.
The Lone Star State hitting a new single day record with more 10,000 new coronavirus cases just yesterday. This as the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut add Delaware, Kansas and Oklahoma to its mandatory quarantine list.
President Trump officially pulling the United States out of the World Health Organization, the administration sending a withdrawal notice to U.N. Secretary General and Key Congressional Leaders. President Trump has called the organization a puppet of China, slamming the organization for it's response to the coronavirus pandemic. The move goes into effect next July.
President Trump is also pushing for schools to reopen nationwide, call for local officials to bring students and teachers back to class this fall.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We don't want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. They think it's going to be good for them politically so they keep the schools closed, no way. So we're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools to get them it open. It's very important for our country
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: The White House is arguing that even with coronaviruses cases rising across much of the country, the death rates are lower and keeping children at home is harmful to students and their parents. Ultimately, it is up to local officials on whether in-person classes will begin this fall.
Well, a new report says mail-in voting could lead to fraud and a waste of American taxpayer dollars. The conservative group, Honest Elections Project, says that voters are casting ballots for dead people and voting in multiple states of the same election. This is exactly what AG Bill Barr told us two weeks ago.
More retailers are feeling the financial pain from the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Ascena Retail Group and the owner of the Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor reportedly plans to file for bankruptcy protection and close at least 1,200 of its 2,800 stores this week. Ascena closed all of its stores in mid-March when the coronavirus first hit and had reopened only 450 of them by late May. The retail stock this morning as you can see down 14 percent. It is sitting at $1.11, sharply lower in the premarket.
Well, the largest wealth transfer in human history, that is how FBI Director, Christopher Wray, characterizes China's cyber attack efforts.
(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)
CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: We've now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are all related to China.
(END VIDEOCLIP)
BARTIROMO: Additionally, National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien, and National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, are calling on the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board to divest its money from Chinese entities over national security risks. Joining me right now is New York Congressman, Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Financial Services Committee, Lee Zeldin. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.
REP. LEE ZELDIN (R-NY), HOUSE FOREIGN AFFIARS CMTE MEMBER: Good to see you.
BARTIROMO: First I want to talk about your Foreign Affairs Committee and the threat that is China. Assess the threat for us.
ZELDIN: The threat is huge. This is something that started before the coronavirus pandemic hit our country. Obviously China has been much more in the news. We desperately relied on China for personal protective equipment. We rely on them for - and other countries around the world for ventilators, medicines. So part of that supply chain discussion is one that you find the average American engaging in now, but what we saw whether it's a social media like a company like Tik Tok, CFIUS launched an investigation last November after they tried to acquire Musically. We also seen it with the race for 5G and Huawei, the ability with that infrastructure to be able to collect personal communications of individuals, the theft that takes place of U.S. patents and intellectual property. So that list actually goes even much further, and this has been one that Congress has been engaged in for years, that our country has had a huge amount of tension with China on, but it's really just been over the course of the last several months that you're seeing much more of the average American start to engage because it very personally impacted their lives due to what happened at the outset of this pandemic.
BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I just think it's extraordinary that this is a situation where theft is actually a strategy for the communist party. That is how they believe they will grow to become the number one superpower by stealing intellectual property whether it's military data, medicine data. They're trying to get a COVID-19 vaccine before us by stealing the information and then filing a patent based on the information they just stole. The question really is what do we do about it? Is this enough in terms of the president saying don't invest in companies that are building military equipment in China and move the supply chains? Is there anything else we can do to stop the theft? They've already - Chris Wray just told us most adult Americans have already had their information stolen.
ZELDIN: Yes, so for one as it relates to, for example, the pension investment, that's not just an act as far as the United States and China and leverage over the country of China, but it's also about protecting those pensions themselves because if the United States takes action that can adversely impact those -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes.
ZELDIN: -- Chinese companies, you don't want to see Americans harmed. I mentioned earlier the CFIUS investigation because, you know, we have a decision to make as it relates to Tik Tok. They are controlled. They are censored by the CCP. They are collecting information. One of the tactics that get used by China with regards to their cyber security -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes.
ZELDIN: -- effort is looking at individual social media accounts to choose who has connections with the government, who to target.
BARTIROMO: I see.
ZELDIN: We can stop that activity -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes.
ZELDIN: -- with Tik Tok. The list goes on.
BARTIROMO: All right, I want to - I want to get to another subject, but isn't it an interesting strategy Xi Jinping has come up with? While the president is pushing these retirement funds, whether it's the Thrift Fund or the Railroad Retirement Fund, to stop investing in Chinese companies, Xi Jinping is rallying the country to buy stocks so that you see a huge rally in China and then investors can say, well wait a second. You're telling us not to buy the stocks, but look at the rally. He's very strategic Xi Jinping. Really interesting to see what he did this last week by telling the country buy stocks. We need a bull market. That's exactly what happened. Millions of Chinese opened accounts.
All right, let me ask you about defunding the police amid the crime surge. Terrible numbers, Congressman. New York City seeing shootings up 130 percent in the month of June compared to 2019 after moving to cut more than a billion dollars from the NYPD budget. I spoke with the former mayor, Rudy Giuliani, in the last hour about the uptick in crime. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Now we're challenging Chicago as a killing field. It's a tragedy. The man is a disgrace, and the governor is way past the time you should have removed him. I mean, this is not - this is not even debatable any longer. People are dying because of his incompetence.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
BARTIROMO: Congressman, I know you also took to Twitter last night to call out de Blasio. You wrote this. ""Mayor de Blasio is destroying our great city from the inside out. New York City will not make it through the remainder of his term. He needs to be immediately removed from office to save the city and protect the people who live there."" Look, it was the smallest electorate that ever came out to vote for Mayor de Blasio. What can be done to turn New York City around if the public keeps voting for him and people like him in terms of leadership positions?
ZELDIN: And for one, I mean, New York City is not going to be able to make it through the rest of de Blasio's term. As you pointed out, he has to be removed. I agree with the mayor, and it's about public safety. We see it with policies from defunding the police to the cashless bail that was launched earlier this year. That was something in many respect Albany was directly involved in as well.
What's ironic about Mayor de Blasio's pandering to the radically left is that when he stands in front of them, they're booing him, so what are you doing this for? Why don't you just stand with our law enforcement, stand with - you know, for rule of law, for safety and security because there are a lot of people who live in New York City, who love the city, who wanted to see it flourish and prosper. That's about improving our education, providing more opportunity. And on the economic front, you know, you have a point where New York City if you work there, you're paying essentially the second highest income tax rate in the entire country next to California. So on so many fronts Mayor de Blasio has the city going in the wrong direction.
BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, but the shootings are going on. Do you think that there is going to be a more moderate person that actually can win in New York?
ZELDIN: Yes, absolutely. This is - it feels a lot like when David Dinkins was finishing his term and you were moving to Rudy Giuliani coming into office. Right now, I believe that New Yorkers are desperate not based on Republican Democrat. They're looking for a person to actually lead the city to be better and stronger on public safety and to address these concerns.
BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. Congressman, it's very concerning. It's good to see you this morning and get your insights. Thank you, sir.
ZELDIN: Always good to see you.
BARTIROMO: And to you, Congressman Lee Zeldin. We have a Fox Business alert. Shares of Biogen this morning are soaring. The biotech giant filing for FDA approval for its Alzheimer's treatment. Right now, there are no drugs approved by the FDA that can reverse mental decline fro Alzheimer's. The stock this morning is up 8 percent. This is very good news. We will be right back.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New York City reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio announcing childcare centers could open as early as next week. The city now in phase three of getting back to business. The pandemic hitting New York City real estate hard. The second quarter seeing a steep decline in commercial property sales, which could hit the city's tax collections.
Joining me right now is Peebles Corporation Founder, Chairman and CEO, Don Peebles. Don it is always great to see you. Assess the situation for us in terms of real estate in New York. We just spoke with Mayor Rudy Giuliani who went through the crime situation and it's really a sad story. What can you tell us about real estate?
DON PEEBLES, FOUNDER, PEEBLES CORPORATION: Well what happened, Maria, is prior to this pandemic New York was struggling in terms of our real estate industry. People were leaving the city, high income earners and fleeing to states like Florida which are more tax friendly, more business friendly and better quality of life.
And so what had happened is New York City's quality of like had been diminishing over a number of years over the past six to - years or so. Also the quality of like has diminished and as a result people left. The pandemic has now accelerated that. And also companies have been looking at New York City and questioning why they continue to operate there because of the fact that the business environment is so anti-business.
And so as a result you've seen businesses leave the area and again go to the Sunbelt states and other states around the country that are business friendly. And so what's happening now is you're seeing an acceleration of that.
BARTIROMO: And I know - and you've got - you've got businesses all over the country, Florida, you're actually seeing those people come into Florida in some cases. Crime is surging in our largest cities. New York City saw a violent 4th of July weekend, 44 shootings, Don, 11 homicides. For the month of June the city experienced over 200 shootings compared to less than 90 one year earlier.
I mean have you ever seen anything like this?
PEEBLES: Not in a very long time, in fact, when I saw the weekend statistics I thought I was looking at one of the second quarter statistics. I couldn't believe that that was just one weekend of activity. Clearly what's happening again is people are being - are frustrated because they're being quarantined. Two, we've got economic crises; three, there is a real absence of leadership in terms of what are the essential services that the government ought to be providing New Yorkers.
And I think that's one of the things that has contributed to this and of course there's been other reforms, if you will, that have lent themselves to an acceleration of criminal activity.
BARTIROMO: Don, let me ask you this. We had Ben Carson on a couple of weeks ago and he said, look, we don't need all of this commercial real estate anymore in big cities. People are fleeing. They want to work from home. He said maybe we can use some of that real estate for low income housing. Do you think we're going to see a transition in New York where, you know, big buildings used to be for big business and maybe now they'll be low income housing?
PEEBLES: Well look, I mean, there's one school of thought. If you look at Detroit in the 1950s it was a city of two million people and now it's a city of 600,000 people, but their industry was decimated as well. New York is the greatest city in the country and one of the greatest cities in the world. And as a result of that, it's very resilient. It's got a very powerful and innovative industry, the financial services industry. So I don't think you're going to see people abandoning offices. I think that there's going to be a change in how people work, and there's also going to be a change in terms of how people - companies identify talent. I mean, now people don't have t live close to where they work. And so, the whole country is a place where you can attract talent, and therefore you're going to see a much greater -
(CROSSTALK)
BARTIROMO: Yes.
PEEBLES: -- increase in, you know, remote working.
BARTIROMO: All right. Real quick before you go, Don. You're a Democrat. You are a business man. You are a moderate. Will you run for Mayor of New York?
PEEBLES: I unlike the person that you heard - that you had on earlier, I'm not sure a moderate can win in New York City. I mean, look, I'm focused on navigating my business and leading my business through this great crisis that we're confronting, and we're active in eight different cities. And so, I'm going to focus my energy there right now, and we'll see where the politics goes later.
BARTIROMO: Ah, this is a better answer than in the past. We're getting closer, Don Peebles. It's good to see you this morning, my friend. Please come back soon. Don Peebles -
(CROSSTALK)
PEEBLES: Thank you. Good to see you.
BARTIROMO: -- joining us there. We'll be right back.
BARTIROMO: Well the show must go on, AMC Theaters nearing a restructuring deal to avoid filing for bankruptcy according to ""The Wall Street Journal"". The deal would require bond holders to provide a senior loan of $200 million. The chain has postponed opening its theaters until July 30. Michael, your reaction.
LEE: Yes, look, this is a really risky deal. Even if we get to the other side of the coronavirus and everything normalizes, movie theaters are in structural decline because the at-home viewing experience is - continues to improve. As well as content competition from the likes of Netflix and other streaming services. I think this is really risky.
BARTIROMO: Dagen, what do you think?
MCDOWELL: Well I think that major movie theater change is a part of group including AMC, Regal and Cinemark had to sue the governor of New Jersey about reopening. Said that churches and shopping malls can reopen but the state continues to bar cinemas from resuming operations. Again it's not a level playing field. And if you can go to church and wear a mask and keep your distance.
I know it's not the same thing, freedom of religion, I understand that. You should certainly be able to go to a movie theater. And the sound quality's better and so are the snacks than anything you've got in your house.
BARTIROMO: That's true. Steve, what do you think?
FORBES: Yes, if you don't mind spending a lot of money and paying three times as much for popcorn as you should, it's a great experience. They were in secular decline, I think they will have a revival but AMC and others were done in by this coronavirus crisis hastened what was happening already. And I do think theaters will come back, they always do.
Television nearly destroyed them after World War II, they came back. People like the experience of going out. And by the way, this whole deal, I'm glad ""The Journal"" says it's nearly complete because you still have fights among creditors about who gets what and who has to put in how much and things like that. Who have first lien, second lien, all that kind of stuff. So the sooner they can get it done the more they can create an experience where people, like me, dinosaurs that we are, will go and pay $20 for popcorn.
BARTIROMO: Yes and maybe when we get out of this, we'll want to go out even more. So there's that. Let's take a break, when we come back we're going to talk with acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. A lot to talk about with the secretary including increasing crime across our country and combating China. That's coming up next. Chad Wolf, live.
Then wine woes, the new issues the industry is seeing as tariffs loom. We are taking a look when we come right back.
MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 8th. We're taking a look at markets right here at 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.
Futures have been searching for direction, but we are looking at a pretty good reversal of fortune. We're looking at a higher opening for the broader averages after negative performances for much of the morning. The Dow futures right now are up 17 points, the Nasdaq futures up 30 points. That's been the real winner all morning. The S&P is up 3.75. Investors are still eyeing the coronavirus spikes across the country and rising tensions with China.
Global markets this morning mostly lower. European indices are red across the board, although here too we are off of our lows of the morning. There is concern growing that the European Union cannot unite on a plan to fix the economy. Hungary's prime minister says that the EU is unlikely to agree on a stimulus program at next week's summit. The FT 100 down 22, the CAC quarante down 51, and the DAX index down 73.
In Asia overnight, markets were mixed but the Chinese stock rally continues. The Shanghai composite extending a winning streak to now seven days with the Shanghai composite up 1.75 percent.
Two people in California charged with a hate crime after allegedly painting over a Black Lives Matter mural.
Cheryl Casone with the details.
Cheryl.
CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.
The two San Francisco area residents were charged yesterday after a video of them allegedly defacing the newly painted mural went viral. Nicole Anderson accused of using black paint and a roller to cover up the mural. This happened in Martinez, California, on the Fourth of July. David Nelson, the man with her, charged with getting into a heated confrontation with Black Lives Matter supporters. A local Black Lives Matter movement got a city permit to paint that mural just last week. Anderson and Nelson are facing a number of charges, including a hate crime violation.
Well, the Covid-19 pandemic is forcing Carnival to delay the launch of its newest ship. The Mardi Gras will now set sail from Port Canaveral, Florida, on February 6th, four months later than originally planned. That ship is powered by cleaner burning liquefied natural gas and it's also going to feature -- and we've done the story on the show, the first roller coaster at sea, but folks are going to have to wait. In addition, Carnival says renovations on the Radiant (ph) is not going to be completed until the spring after working in dry-dock (ph) in Spain was suspended due to the coronavirus. The Breeze (ph) cruise ship redeployed to take over the Radiant's itineraries from November to April of next year and then Carnival's Magics (ph) transatlantic and European itineraries from March of next year through May all canceled. Well, there is Carnival in the pre- market. It's up more than half a percent right now. Thirty cruises have now offed (ph) their charts from November till next May.
And finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.
The NHL's Chicago Black Hawks say it will not change its name or logo despite a push to eliminate racially insensitive material. The team says the name celebrates the life of Black Hawk of Illinois' Sac & Fox Nation.
Amazon not going to receive incentive payments this year for its second headquarters in northern Virginia because the payments are tied to the tourism industry, which has been hit by the coronavirus.
And, finally, KFC has replaced its potato wedges with new secret recipe fries. And that, Maria, is nationwide.
And those are your headlines from the newsroom. Back over to you.
BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.
We've been talking about the crime across the country this morning. Crime is on the rise. Cities across the country have seen dramatic spikes in violent crimes, like shootings and deaths. The Trump administration announcing it is ready to help cities tackle this growing epidemic. Joining me right now is acting secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf.
Secretary, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.
CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Well, thanks for having me.
BARTIROMO: The numbers -- the numbers are dreadful when you look at the number of shootings, just the incredibly violent July 4th weekend New York City is one. Should states and cities be reaching out to the federal government for help in -- in terms of these spikes in crimes?
WOLF: Absolutely. And the president's been very clear about that, that localities and states, if they need assistance, then they should certainly call on the federal government. And I think what we're seeing around -- around the country, whether it's Atlanta, Chicago or New York is really a direct effect on what we talk about when we talk about defunding the police or law enforcement, attacking law enforcement and politicizing what law enforcement does. And I think criminals are really taking notice of this. And -- and criminalize at their core are violent opportunists and they are seeing that opportunity to take advantage and to do their violent act across the country.
And so I think it's having a direct effect. The -- the -- the comments about again defunding the police and really attacking law enforcement, this is the result of that, and we've got to be very, very careful about that.
BARTIROMO: Well, unfortunately, it's not just comments. New York City did, in fact, Mayor de Blasio, take a billion dollars out of the NYPD.
WOLF: Right.
BARTIROMO: So what can the federal government do about this? Who is going to bring law and order back to this country?
WOLF: You're absolutely right. Whether it's New York -- and we also saw Portland also vote to defund I believe 15 million from their police department as well, the president's been very clear, a the -- at the core of this, though, this is a -- both a local and state responsibility. When their ability -- they can no longer protect their cities, they need to call on the federal government, but they have to request that.
What we've seen in Georgia, Governor Kemp has called out the National Guard to parts of Atlanta. He's taken that right step. We need other governors to follow. If they don't want to do it through the National Guard, we can provide some civil law enforcement capabilities to states and governors, but they have to ask for it. That's how the law works. President Trump's been very clear about that, if they ask, we will respond.
BARTIROMO: You know, when you look at some of the Democratic run cities, Mayor Giuliani was just with us and he -- and he named a number of cities that are run by Democrat mayors. I don't know if it's the sanctuary city policies or what it is, but why is it that all these Democratic run cities are going off the rails right now? Are these policies killing our cities?
WOLF: Absolutely. And I think the core of this is a lot of those mayors, a lot of those individual leaders that are running those big city metropolitan areas are playing politics, whether it's with sanctuary city policies or, again, attacking our law enforcement. They are doing that for politics and it's having a very, very detrimental effect that we're seeing. We're seeing a rise in the number of violent crimes in these cities and it's a direct effect of that.
Criminals are taking notice. They understand what's going on. And, again, at the core are violent opportunists and they're taking this opportunity to, again, do what they do every day in a very criminal way.
BARTIROMO: Well, if that's the case, and they're playing politics, the American people should be outraged and they should be voting these people out. That is the number one job that any official has, keep the citizens safe.
Let me ask you about these new guidelines from the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, which force international students to leave the United States if their school only offers online classes this fall. Now we're learning that Harvard and MIT are suing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE over this action.
Secretary Wolf, your reaction?
WOLF: Sure. So what we did is we wanted to make sure, as we went into the fall session, that students and universities understood the rules of the road. What I think they don't understand is right now, under the regulation, international students can only take one online class. We have amended that. We -- we told them as much. We're going to move that up to three online classes. So we're giving them more flexibility.
But at the -- at the core of this is, they want students to still come here to the U.S. and take classes 100 percent online. And the student visa, Maria, as you know, is you have -- your presence is required here in the U.S. That's why you get the visa. If you're taking 100 percent of your classes online, your presence isn't required here in the U.S. to do that. So schools need to think hard about that. And, again, our change is actually providing them more flexibility. Right now they can only take one class online. We're giving them the opportunity to take up to three classes online.
BARTIROMO: Well, look, this brings me to the threat posed by the Chinese communist government, of course. And yesterday we heard another speech from the FBI director, Christopher Wray. This is among a string of speeches from U.S. officials. And he was talking about Chinese theft of intellectual property and information among the largest transfers of wealth in human history that comes a month after a Harvard professor was indicted over criminal ties to China.
What -- what do you want to do in terms of this threat from China. Lay it out for us. I know that there's a massive espionage campaign going on. Is it largely the Chinese communist government sending -- sending researchers in to this country to work, get jobs at universities so that they can send info back? How are they doing this?
WOLF: Absolutely, Maria, I think it's all of the above. And I agree with Director Wray's comments. When we look at China, we know that they have a number of bad behaviors and activities across the spectrum. And whether it's national security and economic security is really what they're after. And they play the long game.
So we have other nation state threats, whether it's Russia and Iran, but China is really playing that long game and we've got to be very, very concerned about that. So whether we -- we talk about, at the department, foreign investment into the U.S., which China is actively doing and we have -- we take measures against that, or whether they're using our immigration system and our visa system, whether they're coming over as researchers, as students and then they're sending that information back. The president, as you know, last month, took action regarding Chinese students with ties to the PRC, making sure that they don't do that graduate level research and study and sending that back to use for their military purposes. The department has also taken action when we talk about Chinese media, making sure that they check in with the department and we know who they are, we know where they are, and we're able to vet them.
So the department and the administration, we're taking concrete actions to -- to really tamp down on what we see as a lot of espionage going on by the Chinese government in a variety of different sectors.
BARTIROMO: Well, by the way, it's no different than what they do to us. I went to China. I -- 15 years ago and I had to travel the country with a minder (ph). They called him a minder. This guy followed me around everywhere and he wanted to know exactly what we were covering and what we were doing. So they're much more diligent about doing this now. The U.S. is doing basically what China has been doing.
Let me -- let me ask you about the threat in terms of -- yes, go ahead. What -- you want to say something, Secretary?
WOLF: No, no, no, I -- you're -- you're -- you're absolutely right. And I think what we see China using is our open society, our democratic society, and them understanding our laws and what they can get away with and what they can't. And I think this administration, unlike previous administrations, who perhaps admired the problem, we're taking definitive action to tamp down on what Chinese -- China is doing again with students, with researchers, and stealing that intellectual property and we're calling them out on it and, again, taking that action.
BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears and ask you about DACA, because the Trump administration expected to file a new executive order on DACA sometime this week. the Supreme Court recently blocking the president's move to end the DACA program.
What are you expecting here, Secretary?
WOLF: Yes, well, two things I would say about the DACA decision from the Supreme Court. One, none of the justices said that the program was lawful. And I think that's very, very concerning. We know that it is an unlawful program and the president's been very clear about finding a lasting solution for this population. But we will not continue to operate an unlawful program.
And, two, the court said that the department had every right to rescind the program. They simply didn't like the rationale and how we did it.
So we're taking a look at the opinion. We've done that. And we are drawing up paperwork should the president want to, again, end the DACA program, we'll be ready to do that.
BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.
Secretary, it's good to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us.
WOLF: OK. Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Secretary Chad Wolf there.
Coming up, wine woes. Issues the industry is seeing as tariffs loom.
Plus, step by step. We've heard that 10,000 steps a day is best for our health, right, but that number may be a myth. We will explain.
You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.
BARTIROMO: Well, wine woes. The industry already taking a major hit due to a decline in restaurant purchases. And now tariffs could serve up even more setbacks.
Kristina Partsinevelos joins us live from a winery on Long Island.
Kristina.
KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Maria, although it may feel like you're drinking a lot more wine at home due to the pandemic and lockdown, that boost in sales is still not enough to offset the dramatic decline in purchases from bars and restaurants.
I'm at the Paumanok Vineyard, like you said, in Long Island. Right now you can see a worker just picking sauvignon blanc. But I spoke to the winery here, which is a multifamily estate, and he said there's been a dramatic drop in sales because he primarily sells to restaurants in Long Island and New York City.
And that talks about the bigger trend. IWSR, a firm that tracks global alcohol sales, estimates alcohol consumption in 2020 will plunge by more than 10 percent. Meaning, the wine industry specifically could potentially lose $6 billion, almost $6 billion in 2020. And if we're talking about 2019, we've seen the first decline in wine sales in almost 25 years. And we could face some sticker shock as well because the White House has threatened to increase tariffs from 25 percent to 100 percent on European imported wine.
We spoke to one U.S. wine importer about what that could mean for prices here in America. Listen in.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHAWN BALZANO, NATIONAL SALES DIRECTOR, ZONIN USA: This is going to have to be paid and the -- the cost is going to go back to the consumer eventually, whether it's through higher prices or higher acquisition costs by restaurants or retail establishments. So, eventually, the consumer is going to feel the brunt.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PARTSINEVELOS: And while importers are reeling from the added cost, this could be a benefit for domestic producers as maybe Americans are drinkers here of wine could shift to domestic producers like Paumanok Vineyards, where I am, which means made in America might be good for the wine industry, but we'll wait and see. You can see that wine, though, the vines are growing, Maria, and the wine keeps selling.
Back to you.
BARTIROMO: Looks beautiful there, Kristina, thank you.
Kristina Partsinevelos this morning at a winery.
Coming up, step it out. Why some experts are saying 10,000 steps a day is more than enough to stay healthy. We're going to take a look at what it takes.
And then a programming note, North Carolina Congressional Candidate Madison Cawthorn will be our special guest on Friday. He'll be joining the panel. Don't miss it. He'll be here Friday morning.
Back in a moment right here.
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
A ""Fox Business Alert"" right now.
Shares of Walgreens rising this morning. The company announcing plans to open 700 Village MD primary care practices with doctors in its stores. The plan includes taking a 30 percent stake in Village MD. Walgreens reports earnings on Thursday. We'll likely hear more about it then. But, right now, the stock is up better than 2 percent on the news.
Well, an about face. If you have been scrambling to get those 10,000 steps in every day, relax. It turns out experts now say it only takes 4,400 steps, about two miles a day, to improve your health. But more steps are always better for your heart.
And back with us right now to discuss this, and the benefits of daily fitness, family medicine physician Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, a.k.a. Dr. Mike.
Dr. Mike, how many steps do you take a day?
DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, A.K.A. ""DR. MIKE,"" FAMILY MEDICINE: I definitely take more than 10,000 steps a day. That's because I live in New York City and I love to exercise.
You know, it really does vary state by state and even country to country. Americans are sadly lagging behind with the amount of steps we take per day. So I do encourage all of my patients to take more steps.
Now that 10,000 number that we've been advocating for years is really an archaic number. Your health is not just about your steps. Your health means your mental state, your diet, your fitness regimen. And while I encourage my patients to take more steps, if they get to 7,500 steps, not 10,000, that's still enough, they're still doing something.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
VARSHAVSKI: My recommendation would be 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week. Maria, that's only two and a half hours. There's a lot of hours in a week. We can make it happen.
BARTIROMO: Wow, two and a half hours a week? That's it? That -- that sounds easy.
Dagen, I know you're a runner. I bike. I bike 28 miles on Sunday, 20 miles on Monday, and I biked 20 miles yesterday. So I just --
VARSHAVSKI: Wow.
BARTIROMO: I'm not doing steps, but I'm biking.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: That is awesome.
I'm looking at my step --
BARTIROMO: What about you, Dagen?
MCDOWELL: I am looking at my step count of the last week and it was 12,000 steps, which is pretty good, but that includes the step with running. So, basically, I run and then sit on my duff the rest of the day.
VARSHAVSKI: Well, look, that type of exercise is going to be really good for you, Dagen.
BARTIROMO: But you're getting the running in there.
MCDOWELL: Right.
VARSHAVSKI: And, Maria, the fact that you're cycling is also amazing and it's something that I recommend to a lot of my patients because it's a form of low impact exercise, meaning it's more gentle on your joints so you're not going to be experiencing knee pain, ankle pain, as those who are doing high intensity, plyometric, high-impact exercises, like running.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, I love it and I definitely do several hours a week, that's for sure.
Mike, jump in here. What do you do?
MICHAEL LEE, MICHAEL LEE STRATEGY: Yes, Dr. Mike, a quick question, how many steps do you need if you're pumping iron every day like me?
VARSHAVSKI: That's a good question. We -- before used to recommend cardio over strength training, but nowadays it's really the combination of the two that seems to give the best outcomes.
From cardio you strengthen your cardiovascular system, your blood flow, you decrease your cholesterol levels. But then when you do strength training, you're actually burning calories while you're working out and then while you're recovering. It's a really good way to keep your muscle, keep your bones strong and you really need both types of exercise. It's not one or the other.
BARTIROMO: Yes, because you lose bone mass as you age, right? Isn't that right, Dr. Mike?
VARSHAVSKI: Exactly.
BARTIROMO: Always great info from you. Thank you so much, sir.
VARSHAVSKI: Thank you so much, Maria.
BARTIROMO: We will see you soon.
VARSHAVSKI: Stay healthy.
BARTIROMO: We'll be right back with more MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this."
168,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times",2020-11-17,"1298 words","US","Jill Cowan",NA,"California Is ‘Pulling the Emergency Brake’ on Reopening; California Today",FALSE,"Tuesday: With Covid cases on the rise, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the most significant reopening rollback in months.
Good morning.
Californians who have been keeping a wary eye on the state’s rising Covid numbers and wondering whether the hammer might fall got their answer on Monday: Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state was “pulling the emergency brake” on its reopening plan, reinstating broad restrictions across much of the state.
“We’re moving from a marathon to a sprint,” Mr. Newsom said.
More than 40 counties were moved backward in the state’s reopening tiers, including 28 counties that were moved back into the most restrictive purple tier, which now encompasses more than 94 percent of the state’s population.
[Track California’s coronavirus case numbers and hospitalizations.]
In those counties, restaurants, gyms and houses of worship will have to shut down unless they can move outdoors.
Mr. Newsom said health care facilities that were set up near the beginning of the pandemic at arenas and other large spaces were being prepared to quickly open for patients, if necessary. One such facility will open in the next week or so in Imperial County, which was overwhelmed by Covid over the summer, he said.
The state is also looking into a possible curfew and will adjust restriction levels more frequently than has been the case.
The announcement came as the United States reported its 11 millionth confirmed case on Sunday, with a recent average of 150,000 new cases a day, and will probably reach 250,000 total deaths sometime this week. One million cases were recorded in the country over the past week alone.
[Read about the state’s tiered reopening framework.]
Daily case reports are rising in 48 states, and with little action from the Trump administration, governors and mayors across the country are taking new steps to try to halt the spread. On Monday, a sweeping stay-at-home advisory went into effect in Chicago. New Mexico is under a two-week lockdown, and North Dakota has imposed a mask mandate.
While the dire outlook across the rest of the country has perhaps made California look almost stable by comparison, Mr. Newsom said that California’s daily case numbers had doubled in the last 10 days, the fastest increase the state had seen since the beginning of the pandemic.
The state reachedone million known cases on Nov. 12, and the next dayissued travel advisories, along with Oregon and Washington.
[Read more about California’s travel guidelines.]
The increases, the governor said, cross age and racial or ethnic groups and appear throughout the state.
In Los Angeles County, which has struggled for months with higher case numbers, officials stopped short of ordering additional closures, but urged residents to behave more cautiously.
State leaders, including Mr. Newsom, have told residents not to gather with people from outside their households, and to resist visiting relatives over the holidays.
Much of the recent rise in cases, state officials say, appears to have grown from at-home parties or family gatherings.
But in what is likely to be remembered as one of the governor’s more damaging — not to mention embarrassing — episodes of the pandemic, The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Mr. Newsom attended an outdoor dinner for one of his political advisers at the French Laundry, the famed Napa Valley destination, with guests from several households.
[Read about California’s rules for gathering.]
The gathering did not technically violate the state’s rules, because there is no formal limit on the number of households at each outdoor restaurant table, but as critics noted, the governor’s attendance undermined the spirit of restrictions.
Mr. Newsom apologized on Monday, saying that he should have turned around and left when he realized there were more guests at the party than he expected.
“You own the mistake and you don’t ever make it again,” he said. “I expect more from myself and you have that commitment in my resolve.”
That “Covid fatigue,” he said, is real.
Dr. Bob Wachter, a professor and chair of the University of California, San Francisco’s department of medicine, told me on Monday that the moves by the state seemed prudent in light of rising case numbers.
“This strikes me as a reasonable set of actions, particularly with Thanksgiving coming up,” Dr. Wachter said. “Whether or not it’s enough, I guess we’ll see.”

The hearings were conducted via teleconference and featured expert witnesses who provided testimony and answered questions from the commissioners.On Tuesday, June 23, 2020, the commission received testimony from Robin Engel, Ph.D., Professor, University of Cincinnati; Michael Ranalli, Chief (Retired), Glenville, New York, Police Department; Hampton (Virginia) Police Chief Terry Sult; and Springboro (Ohio) Police Chief Jeff Kruithoff.The panelists discussed policing culture and reasonable use of force. 
An overarching theme throughout the panel was the need to use evidence-based research to inform successful reforms regarding police use of force.On Wednesday, June 24, 2020, the commission received testimony from Sheriff James McDonell (retired), Los Angeles (Calif.) County; Ronal Serpas, Superintendent of Police of the New Orleans Police Department (retired) and Professor with the Loyola University New Orleans Criminal Justice Department; Chief Robert White (retired), Denver Police Department; and Sheriff Mike Chitwood, Volusia (Fla.) County.The panel focused on the use of force and culture change. The panelists discussed the importance of leading by example within the department, especially with regards to new officers; integrating community policing values throughout an entire academy curriculum instead of teaching it as a standalone course; acknowledging that while no single police incident represents an entire department, nothing undermines years of work developing community trust as quickly as incidents where police use unnecessary or excessive force; and learning from the successes of other departments and agencies. On Thursday, June 25, 2020, the commission received testimony from Jeff Ballabon, CEO B2 Strategic, Washington, DC; Rabbi Jack Moline, Executive Director, Interfaith Alliance, Washington DC; and Imam Talib Shareef, President of Masjid Muhammad, The Nation's Mosque.The panel focused on the relationship between religious minorities and law enforcement. The panelists discussed the importance of building relationships with law enforcement at a community level in order to change dynamics; the need for law enforcement to take steps at every level to investigate and prevent hate-based crime, as well as hold officers accountable for engaging in racial or religious profiling, targeting, and surveillance; and the value of breaking stereotypes and 'challenging the narrative.'For more information on the commission, please visit: https://www.justice.gov/ag/presidential-commission-law-enforcement-and-administration-justice[1]Audio recordings and transcripts of the hearings will be posted online once available.

On a unanimous vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 5602, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020, a bipartisan bill introduced by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Representative Brad Schneider (D-IL-10). The bill would enhance the federal government's efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess this threat, focus their resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, and provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in addressing these threats.
""Violent white supremacists continue to pose the most significant domestic terrorism threat in our nation. For too long, we've turned a blind eye and haven't seriously addressed this evil in our own backyard,"" Durbin said. ""The federal government must tackle this threat head on and ensure more Americans are not subjected to violence simply because of who they are or what they believe.

This afternoon, the House of Representatives passed a resolution sponsored by U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) that denounces the anti-Asian sentiment that has occurred since the outbreak of the coronavirus.
The measure, which Meng introduced in March, passed by a vote of 243 to 164.
""Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been forced to endure demeaning and disgusting acts of bigotry and hate, consisting of everything from verbal assaults to physical attacks,"" said Meng. ""The House needed to take a strong and public stand against this appalling intolerance, discrimination, and violence that has taken place all across the country during this public health crisis, and today it did just that. The rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and the blaming of Asian Americans for the spread of the coronavirus has been shameful and reckless, particularly when it comes from our nation's leaders such as President Trump, Minority Leader McCarthy and many others who have used terms like 'Chinese virus,' 'Wuhan virus,' and 'Kung-flu,' to stoke people's fears of COVID-19, scapegoat Asian Americans, and fan the flames of hate. But these are more than just hateful and irresponsible words. This language has fueled the increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian descent, and many Asian Americans continue to live in fear.""
""When the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the U.S., I had advised the public about not singling out or stereotyping the Asian American community,"" Meng added. ""But unfortunately, those efforts have not stopped acts of ignorance and bigotry from rearing their ugly heads. It's time for this hysteria and discrimination to end, and I hope that with the passage of my resolution, our nation will work its way towards that goal. I thank and commend all who supported my resolution and joined me in sending a message to the American people that we reject this unacceptable racism, xenophobia, and violence. This measure is about condemning hate and violence and attacks on innocent individuals. We're talking about people's lives and their right to feel and be safe.""
Meng's resolution has 157 cosponsors and has been endorsed by over 500 organizations and entities from across the country. It:
* Calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form;
* Recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority;
* Condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance;
* Calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials:
* To expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian American community in the United States;
* To collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19;
* To hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice;
* Recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant societies:
* To prioritize language access and inclusivity in communication practices; and
* To combat misinformation and discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk.
A Senate version of Meng's resolution is pending in the Senate. It was introduced in May by Senators Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI). The resolutions in each chamber are independent of each other and do not need the signature of the President.

The bill would enhance the federal government’s efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess this threat, focus their resources on the most significant domestic terrorism threats, and provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in addressing these threats.
“Violent white supremacists continue to pose the most significant domestic terrorism threat in our nation. For too long, we’ve turned a blind eye and haven’t seriously addressed this evil in our own backyard,” Durbin said. “The federal government must tackle this threat head on and ensure more Americans are not subjected to violence simply because of who they are or what they believe. I’m pleased the House took an important step forward by passing this bill, and I urge my Republican colleagues in the Senate to immediately take up this legislation and work with us to enact it into law.”
“Racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists were the primary source of ideologically motivated lethal incidents and violence in 2018 and 2019. From the Tree of Life synagogue to a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, we have all tragically seen the deadly effect. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of white nationalist groups rose by 55% since 2017. And last November, the FBI reported violent hate crimes reached a 16 year high in 2018. That number went up in 2019! Groups like the Boogaloos, Rise Above Movement and White Nationalist militias across the country are organizing. And so must we. We therefore need to equip our law enforcement officials, the FBI and Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, with the tools necessary to identify, monitor and prevent violent acts of domestic terrorism,” said Schneider.
Since May 2019, Durbin has led two letters to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray, asking what the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FBI are doing to combat the growing threat of white supremacist violence targeting religious minorities and communities of color. In January, Durbin again pressed DOJ and FBI to take the initiative in leading a coordinated nationwide effort by federal, state, and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies to disrupt and prevent these violent domestic terrorism and hate crime incidents before they take place.
On Thursday, September 17th, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to Congress that “the top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we identify as racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE)” and that most of these are white supremacists.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2019, domestic extremists killed at least 42 people in the United States in 17 separate incidents. This number makes 2019 the sixth deadliest year on record for domestic extremist-related killings. Last year, a Trump Administration Department of Justice official wrote in a New York Times op-ed that “white supremacy and far-right extremism are among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been slow to respond.”
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2020 has been endorsed by the following organizations: Anti-Defamation League, Arab American Institute, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, Human Rights Campaign, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Muslim Advocates, NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Sikh Coalition, Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund, and Unidos."

""Every time the president has invoked my name, it has incited violence against me,"" Rep Omar told Joshua Johnson of MSNBC's The Week.
""This president is creating an environment where he is threatening to lock up his political opponents, where people no longer understand that in a democracy we are supposed to debate policy differences but we are not supposed to harm one another,"" she added. ""And when you have a leader, the president of the United States not understand that, then there is danger, not only to our way of life, but to our democracy and the ways it's supposed to function.""
In March, for example, a New York man who said, ""Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull,"" of Ms Omar was sentenced to a year in prison. (Rep Omar submitted a letter to the court asking for a light sentence, writing, ""The answer to hate is not more hate; it is compassion."")
She also connected the threats she's faced to the ones against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, whom a vigilante group tried to kidnap before being foiled by the FBI earlier this month. Ms Whitmer has said the president's rhetoric has encouraged violent extremism.
""When our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight,"" Whitmer said in a recent speech. ""When our leaders meet, encourage or fraternise with domestic terrorists, they legitimise their actions and they are complicit.""
The president often insults his political opponents, but he is especially aggressive and often extremely racist and xenophobic against Rep Omar and other Muslims, usually while accusing them of being the hateful ones.
During the president's first campaign, he called for a ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" and released a statement that said Muslims have ""great hatred towards Americans"" and ""believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.""
Hate crimes hit a 16-year high in 2018, and some blame the spike on the rhetoric of the president and some of his supporters.

(Dave Workman photo)U.S.A. --(AmmoLand.com)-[1] Democrats unable to deal with the sudden crime increases in major cities are falling back on their favorite scapegoats—guns and Second Amendment rights—to mask their party's failures, according to Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, in a blistering interview with Fox News[2]. As Conway was speaking, major gun rights organizations were reacting to language in a draft of the Democrat 2020 political platform targeting guns and the citizens who own them. While the National Rifle Association declared[3] Democrats want to 'turn the right to keep and bear arms into a privilege dependent on the whim of government bureaucrats,' the Second Amendment Foundation has gone a step further by launching a massive fund-raising effort[4] in anticipation of multiple legal battles. SAF's Alan GottliebSAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb told Ammoland News his email alert has already gone to some 320,000 people and he hopes to reach 1 million members and potential supporters. 
He said the fund-raiser is aimed at educating gun owners 'about this catastrophic threat to their gun rights.' He is making no secret about his intent. SAF, he explained needs to 'have the funds on hand to file a slew of lawsuits to stop our Bill of Rights from being shredded.' Meanwhile, Conway, a key figure in the Trump White House, ripped Democrat mayors in several cities for blaming guns for upticks in urban violence, during an interview with Fox News' Julie Banderas. Conway was reacting to remarks by anti-gun Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), who blamed weak gun control laws and the COVID-19 outbreak for spikes in violence in New York, Chicago and elsewhere. Duckworth called for legislation to 'close the gun show loophole' and require so-called 'universal background checks,' two favorite demands of the far left. Yet, research suggests that criminals don't buy their firearms at gun shows, nor at retail gun stores where they would go through background checks. By no small coincidence, Fox News[5] reported a 268 percent spike in robberies in New York City's Upper East Side, which reportedly is home to several wealthy elitists. At least five of those robberies were at gunpoint. WNYW, a Fox affiliate in New York City[6], reported a 177 percent increase in shootings last month over July 2019. Through the first seven months of this year, shootings in the city are up 72 percent over the first seven months of last year. Democrats want to spin the uptick in violence as the reason they need to crack down on the gun rights of law-abiding citizens. Conway's interview could not have been better timed. Literally while she was talking, the NRA and SAF were reacting to the Democrat party gun control platform draft. Gun rights groups agreed the platform essentially 'declares war' on the right to keep and bear arms. Pulled from Page 43 of their draft plan[7] is this language: 'Democrats will enact universal background checks, end online sales of guns and ammunition, close dangerous loopholes that currently allow stalkers and some individuals convicted of assault or battery to buy and possess firearms, and adequately fund the federal background check system. We will close the 'Charleston loophole' and prevent individuals who have been convicted of hate crimes from possessing firearms. Democrats will ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines. We will incentivize states to enact licensing requirements for owning firearms and 'red flag' laws that allow courts to temporarily remove guns from the possession of those who are a danger to themselves or others. We will pass legislation requiring that guns be safely stored in homes. And Democrats believe that gun companies should be held responsible for their products, just like any other business, and will prioritize repealing the law that shields gun manufacturers from civil liability.'SAF's Gottlieb zeroed in on this paragraph in his fundraising letter.'Make no mistake about it, if Joe Biden wins in November and the Democrats get control of the U.S. Senate this will be the new reality,' he warned. 'And believe me, this is just the beginning of the gun prohibition movement's agenda to finally destroy our Second Amendment rights.' In recent years, SAF has become a legal powerhouse, filing lawsuits all over the map challenging state and local gun control laws and regulations. What made this possible was the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in McDonald v. City of Chicago, a landmark case brought by SAF and the Illinois State Rifle Association. The ruling incorporated the Second Amendment to the states via the 14th Amendment, thus putting a number of local gun laws on a collision course with the Bill of Rights. During her interview, Conway offered a blunt observation about the Democrats' blame game attempt to shift public attention to firearms, and away from her party's ineptitude, if not incompetence, in dealing with the upswing in violence. 'What is the evidence,' she asked, 'that people who are shooting in these cities got their firearms legally, let alone at a gun show and through a loophole? They (Democrats) try to cloud the whole conversation with nonsense' So far as gun rights activists are concerned, 'nonsense' accurately sums up the Democrats' open war on firearms. No other right protected by the Constitution is as regulated by the government or reviled by the Far Left. Gottlieb, while hoping for the best in November, is planning for the worst. He has the example set by gun-hating Democrats in Virginia earlier this year as motivation. 'We can't wait for the election results,' Gottlieb says in his letter to supporters. 'By then it will be too late. The gun confiscation movement funded by billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and George Soros will already be in full control of our government. In record time they will transform our right to keep and bears arms into gun ban and confiscation laws like exist in England, New Zealand, Cuba, and Venezuela. 'Once our rights are lost we won't get them back,' he states. 'The time to act is now.'About Dave Workman Dave Workman is a senior editor atTheGunMag.com[8]and Liberty Park Press,author of multiple books[9] on the Right to Keep &#38; Bear Arms and formerly an NRA-certified firearms instructor.

The Wall Street Journal, October 29: A knife-wielding man killed three people - nearly decapitating one of them - in the Notre Dame Basilica in Nice, police said, in an assault being treated as an act of terrorism â€¦ (Police) encountered the alleged attacker, who shouted ""Allahu akbar"" before being shot â€¦ Police found a knife with a seven-inch blade, two telephones and a copy of the Quran.
Oh, different attack! More from the NYT: French officials' attack on ""Islamic separatism"" and the ""enemy within"" has Muslims questioning whether they will ever fully be accepted.
Even so, there were Muslims who refrained from casting ""Islamophobia"" as an attacker. AP, October 30: The French Council of the Muslim Faith called on French Muslims to refrain from festivities marking the birth of Muhammad ""as a sign of mourning and in solidarity with the families of victims and the Catholics of France"".
Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad disrupted the measured civility of Twitter, October 29: Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past (tweet since taken down).
Not that Mahathir was giving his blessing to the decapitation of French teacher Samuel Paty, Twitter, October 29: The killing is not an act that as a Muslim I would approve. But while I believe in the freedom of expression, I do not think it includes insulting other people. You cannot go up to a man and curse him simply because you believe in freedom of speech.
A bit of respect, is that so hard? More Mahathir: Generally, the West no longer adhere to their own religion. They are Christians in name only. That is their right. But they must not show disrespect for the values of others, for the religion of others. It is a measure of the level of their civilisation to show this respect.
More NYT: French officials have vowed to crack down on what the hardline interior minister, GÃ©rald Darmanin, has called ""the enemy within"", closing a mosque, proposing to ban several Muslim groups the government considers extremist and even suggesting the elimination of ethnic food aisles in stores. Mr Macron, who began a campaign earlier this month against Islamic ""separatism"" from France's deeply held secular values, said recently that Muslims needed to develop an ""Islam of enlightenment"", which many considered patronising.
Lack of respect may even be a sign of mental ill-health, ABC News, October 26: Turkish President Erdogan says French President Emmanuel Macron needs mental ""treatment"" over response to beheading â€¦ Mr Erdogan said the French leader needed mental help for condoning the (Charlie Hebdo) caricatures (of the Prophet).

Grace Meng:
This afternoon, the House of Representatives passed a resolution sponsored by U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) that denounces the anti-Asian sentiment that has occurred since the outbreak of the coronavirus.
The measure, which Meng introduced in March, passed by a vote of 243 to 164.
""Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been forced to endure demeaning and disgusting acts of bigotry and hate, consisting of everything from verbal assaults to physical attacks,"" said Meng. ""The House needed to take a strong and public stand against this appalling intolerance, discrimination, and violence that has taken place all across the country during this public health crisis, and today it did just that. The rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and the blaming of Asian Americans for the spread of the coronavirus has been shameful and reckless, particularly when it comes from our nation's leaders such as President Trump, Majority Leader McCarthy and many others who have used terms like 'Chinese virus,' 'Wuhan virus,' and 'Kung-flu,' to stoke people's fears of COVID-19, scapegoat Asian Americans, and fan the flames of hate. But these are more than just hateful and irresponsible words. This language has fueled the increase of threats and attacks against those of Asian descent, and many Asian Americans continue to live in fear.""
""When the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the U.S., I had advised the public about not singling out or stereotyping the Asian American community,"" Meng added. ""But unfortunately, those efforts have not stopped acts of ignorance and bigotry from rearing their ugly heads. It's time for this hysteria and discrimination to end, and I hope that with the passage of my resolution, our nation will work its way towards that goal. I thank and commend all who supported my resolution and joined me in sending a message to the American people that we reject this unacceptable racism, xenophobia, and violence. This measure is about condemning hate and violence and attacks on innocent individuals. We're talking about people's lives and their right to feel and be safe.""
Meng's resolution has 157 cosponsors and has been endorsed by over 500 organizations and entities from across the country. It:
Calls on all public officials to condemn and denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form;
Recognizes that the health and safety of all Americans, no matter their background, must be of utmost priority;
Condemns all manifestations of expressions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, anti-Asian sentiment, scapegoating, and ethnic or religious intolerance;
Calls on Federal law enforcement officials, working with State and local officials:
To expeditiously investigate and document all credible reports of hate crimes and incidents and threats against the Asian American community in the United States;
To collect data to document the rise of incidences of hate crimes due to COVID-19;
To hold the perpetrators of those crimes, incidents, or threats accountable and bring such perpetrators to justice;
Recommits United States leadership in building more inclusive, diverse, and tolerant societies:
To prioritize language access and inclusivity in communication practices; and
To combat misinformation and discrimination that put Asian Americans at risk.
A Senate version of Meng's resolution is pending in the Senate. It was introduced in May by Senators Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI). The resolutions in each chamber are independent of each other and do not need the signature of the President."

""I believe in my power,"" she said, as people in the crowd echoed the words back. ""I believe in your power. I believe in our power. I believe in black trans power.""
The Black Trans Lives Matter rally in New York, one of many nationwide, came after two black trans women -- Dominique ""Rem'Mie"" Fells, 27, of Philadelphia, and Riah Milton, 25, of Cincinnati, Ohio -- were murdered last week. 
There have been 14 reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people -- including Fells and Milton -- since the start of 2020, according to the Human Rights Campaign. But the number of deaths of trans people are likely undercounted, the Human Rights Campaign said in its report on anti-transgender violence in the US in 2019.
Sunday's protest also took place amid global demonstrations in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has surged in the wake of George Floyd's death. 
It also followed the Trump administration's announcement that it is eliminating an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender. 
Led by and centered around black trans women, Sunday's march and rally in New York gave trans and gender non-conforming people the opportunity to mourn lives lost, and to vocalize their demand for justice and fair treatment. 
""We can't just talk about trans people when they're dying,"" Eliel Cruz, one of the co-organizers of the event and director of communications at NYC Anti-Violence Project, told CNN. ""But what are we doing actively and intentionally to create space for them to be safe and well?""
Protesters wore white as a nod to black history 
Protesters wore white and were asked to march silently for the first portion of Sunday's march. 
Rally co-organizer Fran Tirado explained this decision was made as a nod to black history. In 1917, nearly 10,000 demonstrators in New York City wore white as they participated in the NAACP's Silent Protest Parade, one of the first public demonstrations of civil rights by black Americans. 
""We felt that was a really powerful way to think about our action in relation to a lot of others and how thinking on the metaphor of like silence equals death and how everything comes together,"" Tirado, a queer writer and producer, told CNN. 
""In the 1917 Silent Parade the men wore black while women and children wore white,"" co-organizer West Dakota explained in a statement following the protest. ""The decision to wear white was to symbolize our unity, and also to take a stand against corporate appropriation of the rainbow flag. We don't need rainbow (merchandise) to show our pride.""
The role of organizer in times of civil unrest has most often been filled by the same black and brown people who themselves are facing violence and mistreatment, Tirado said. 
It was important to Sunday's organizers -- a group made up primarily of queer people of color, both black and non-black -- that the legwork of organizing be done by non-trans folks, while keeping the spotlight on the partnering trans activists and organizations. 
""This collective of folks is particularly powerful because it's modeling what is possible when you do have allies and folks who do care and also want to make sure that they're building something that speaks to the hearts of the actual people that they're representing,"" Willis told CNN in an interview. ""So often that doesn't happen.""
Melania Brown, the sister of Layleen Polanco, was among the speakers at the New York rally on Sunday. Polanco, an AfroLatinx transgender woman, died in June of 2019 while being held in solitary confinement following an epileptic seizure at Riker's Island. 
""Black trans lives matter,"" Brown told the crowd. ""My sister's life mattered. All of the loved ones we have lost, all of these beautiful girls that we have lost. There lives matter. We have to protect them.""
Protest partners were all trans-based support organizations
While Sunday's protest came in response to the murders of Fells and Milton, organizers emphasized the necessity to fight for trans lives beyond seeking post-mortem justice. 
Like Fells and Milton, the majority of trans people killed are black women. Ninety-one percent of the reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people in 2019 were black women, and 81% were under the age of 30, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which tracks reported killings.
Violence against the transgender community often goes unreported or misreported, as a result of authorities, media reports, and family members misidentifying the dead, the Human Rights Campaign said.
Deadnaming is the term used to refer to the use of a trans person's birth name in place of their chosen name, as has been the case for Riah Milton, who was deadnamed and misgendered by the Butler County Sheriff's Office in a press conference last Thursday. CNN has reached out to the sheriff's office, which is handling the case, for request for comment.
All of the partners in Sunday's protest are trans-based support organizations that provide both immediate and longterm assistance to trans people, organizers said. 
The Okra Project delivers free meals to trans and gender non-conforming individuals who are experiencing food insecurity. Gays and Lesbians Living In a Transgender Society (G.L.I.T.S) facilitates assistance, including health care and housing, for transgender sex workers. The organization is nearing its $1 million fundraising goal following a surge in donations, said Ceyenne Doroshow, G.L.I.T.S founder, on Sunday.
Nationwide solidarity
New York City wasn't the only place where trans activists and allies mobilized.
In Los Angeles on Sunday, an estimated 25,000 people marched through Hollywood during an All Black Lives Matter protest, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The march was meant to honor Tony McDade, a black transgender man who was shot by a Tallahassee police officer last week.
Protesters carried rainbow flags and balloons, as an aircraft overhead pulled a ""Black Lives Matter"" banner.
""The protest is in direct response to racial injustice, systemic racism, and all forms of oppression,"" the Black LGBTQIA Advisory Board Council, which organized the protest, said on its website.
A group of people in Chicago organized a Drag March for Change this weekend. They demanded justice for victims of police brutality, as well as a reclassification of violence against transgender individuals as hate crimes, CNN affiliate WLS reported.
In Boston, thousands chanted ""no justice, no peace, no anti-trans violence on our streets"" as they marched from Franklin Park to Nubian Square, CNN affiliate WCVB reported.
""We know that black people are vulnerable -- especially vulnerable in this society -- and especially trans folks and trans black folks,"" protester Khery Petersen-Smith told WCVB. ""So I think it's important we all show up and build solidarity.""

The Hilfiger hijab has the letters ""TH"" initialed throughout the garment, and has been crafted from fine jacquard fabric. It comes in ivory and ""sky captain"" grey. Last month the label dressed model Halima Aden in a custom-made burkini for Sports Illustrated.
It's not the first time the fashion industry has recognized the significance of so-called modest fashion. In 2016 at New York fashion week Anniesa Hasibuan was the first designer to show a collection where all models wore the hijab. Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY and Mango have done ""Ramadan collections"", while worldwide Modest Fashion Weeks are happening from Miami to Amsterdam.
After the fashion industry has been criticized for its lack of diversity and racism, following the Black Lives Matter protests, the Hilfiger hijab could suggest major fashion brands are stepping forward with inclusive practices. But Hassanah El-Yacoubi, founder of modest fashion brand PFH, says that it also shows market changes rather than cultural ones.
""It's more indicative of an ever-growing Muslim consumer culture that is lucrative and thriving more than ever now,"" El-Yacoubi said.
The Islamic fashion industry is estimated to be worth $88bn by 2025, according to Grand View Research. ""I think the timing reflects the need to address a growing desire in the market by consumers - especially millennials and Generation Z - for greater inclusivity from the brands they support,"" said Arthur Zaczkiewicz, the executive editor of fashion industry publication Women's Wear Daily.
Research has shown that a younger tranche of consumers are less concerned with ""fitting in"" and more with making choices that reflect their own values.
After years of being ""othered"" by mainstream fashion, the perception of modest fashion is altering. ""I believe we are experiencing a permanent cultural shift instead of a fleeting style that's in vogue temporarily,"" said El-Yacoubi.
""More and more retailers are focusing on inclusivity and adding products to their assortment that support modest dressing,"" said Krista Corrigan from retail market intelligence company Edited. She said that 10% of shops tracked by the company stock such garments compared to just 2% in 2019.
Zaczkiewicz said: ""It's important to understand that modest fashion is not a trend. It's how people live.""
Yet most observers believe the Hilfiger hijab is only a small step towards a wider acceptance of Muslim dressing.
""No matter how mainstream or celebrated modest fashion has become, the reality remains that Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiments have been at an all-time high in the US,"" said El-Yacoubi.
Hate-crime violence hit a 16-year high last year in the US, while in 2019 52% of UK hate crimes were committed against Muslims.
""Since modest fashion is generally perceived to be a phenomenon spearheaded by hijab-donning women, they usually bear the brunt of such beliefs,"" said El-Yacoubi.
Muslim clothing continues to be a political lightning rod and a sartorial subtext for Islamophobic rhetoric.
In July, the German state of Baden-Württemberg banned burqas and niqabs in schools. It followed similar bans in Sri Lanka and Denmark. Other countries that have banned Muslim dress include Latvia, Austria, Bulgaria and Belgium.
Last year the French sporting goods label Decathlon dropped plans to sell a sports hijab after politicians' reaction exposed religious tensions there, again focused on Muslim women's attire.
Still, the launch of the hijab follows on from Hilfiger's promises to be more inclusive. Last month its parent company PVH announced a program to increase opportunities for people of color people at the company. "

His crime[2] was existing as a free Black man in America. The McMichaels and Bryan hunted him down like he was a frightened animal, and then Travis McMichael shot him dead. They almost got away with it. 
Gregory McMichael was a former Glynn County, Georgia, police officer, so he knew the best lies to tell: Arbery 'fit the description"" of a criminal, and the 'suspect"" resisted arrest. Arbery's killing was simply 'self-defense.""Derek Chauvin and the Minneapolis Police Department[3] tried to pass off a similar character assassination after Chauvin executed George Floyd. Fortunately, a civilian recorded what actually happened. Bryan wasn't concerned about justice when he filmed his impromptu snuff movie, nor was Gregory McMichael when he released it. They actually believed the footage would bolster their case. They're idiots, and while that's not against the law, [4]the murder of a Black man still is. Wednesday, the Glynn County grand jury returned an indictment with nine counts each against the McMichaels and Bryan: malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment.Those last two counts are important to me: A Georgia grand jury agreed that these racist assholes had no right to pursue or detain Arbery. He was free to jog through their Satilla Shores neighborhood. He was even free to stop and admire a construction project. He was free, damnit, and this is supposed to be America.District Attorney Joyette M. Holmes of Cobb County convinced the grand jury[5] to indict these three ham sandwiches in 10 minutes. She's a Black woman, and two previous white prosecutors, particularly Ware County's George E. Barnhill,[6] were willing to let Arbery's killers walk. Some people might dismiss a Black prosecutor as 'just a cop,""[7] but personally, I like having a cop on my side for a change. From the New York Times:[8] ""This is another step forward in seeking justice for Ahmaud,"" Ms. Holmes said in a statement, adding, ""We will continue to be intentional in the pursuit of justice for this family and the community at large as the prosecution of this case continues."" Journalist Justin Glawe reported[9] that Bryan's lawyer declared that his client is 'presumed innocent, but he has already lost his job."" Arbery was actually innocent — no presumption necessary — and he lost his life. Bryan's lawyer went on to say that several of Bryan's family members had lost their jobs, as well. It was unclear if this was COVID-19-related or racism-related, but really, times are tough all over.Bryan's lawyer said his client 'disagreed"" with the grand jury's decision. That's hilarious. It reminds me of a scene from 'Law &#38; Order"" where the attorney representing a couple of rich scumbags informs the judge that 'my clients aren't interested in any jail time."" The judge responds, deadpan, 'I'm sure they aren't.""Thea Brooks, Arbery's aunt, told Glawe:[10] I am praising God for another victory we have won. It is now time to go to trial. I expect things to continue to move in a positive direction with the hopes of life in prison, no parole or execution. This is a good start, but as Malcolm X famously said, 'I'm not satisfied."" I agree with James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP, who said Barnhill and Brunswick, Georgia, District Attorney Jackie Johnson 'refused to do their jobs"" and should be removed from office before they let any other weekend lynchers skate. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Monday that petitions to have Johnson and Barnhill removed from office could go forward. Georgia lawmakers are also working to pass a hate-crimes bill.[11] This is all a good start but I'll never be satisfied because Ahmaud Arbery never lived to see 26.

Issued on: July 6, 2020
James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:29 P.M. EDT
MS. MCENANY: All right. Hello, everyone. Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future. The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities. President Trump said, ""After all, what do we want? We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order."" He went on to say, ""We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world."" He went on to say, ""We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things?""
This message is now more important and more timely than ever. Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi. Misguided movements, such as ""Defund the Police,"" seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever. Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country. An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families. Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, ""Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation...We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so...they can build its future.""
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it's an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I'll take questions.
Peter.
Q Kayleigh, I want to ask you just a couple questions. The first one: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So I think you're referring to a tweet this morning. Is that right?
Q Correct.
MS. MCENANY: Well, I think you're mischaracterizing the tweet. The tweet was aimed at pointing out that the FBI report of the alleged hate crime at NASCAR concluded that the garage door pull, which had been there since last fall, was obviously not targeted at a specific individual because, in fact, it was a garage pull and, in fact, it was there since last fall, long before these 43 teams arrived. And it was concluded by the FBI that this was, quote, ""not an intentional racist act.""
Q For clarity, I'm asking you about the Confederate flags. My question is: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: The President never said that. Again, you're taking his tweet completely out of context.
Q The President said that NASCAR saw bad ratings because they took down the Confederate flag, banned the Confederate flag. Does he believe NASCAR should fly the Confederate flag? And why don't they fly it here?
MS. MCENANY: The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that, in fact, was not a hate crime. At the very end, the ban on the flag was mentioned in the broader context of the fact that he rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women who go to these sporting events are racist when, in fact, as it turns out, what we saw with the FBI report and the alleged incident of a hate crime it was a complete indictment of the media's rush to judgment once again, calling this a hate crime when the FBI completely dismissed that.
Q Let me ask you about some of the President's comments this weekend. The President said that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless. Which members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force agree with that statement?
MS. MCENANY: So what the President was pointing to and I'm glad you brought it up was a factual statement, one that is rooted in science and one that was pointing out the fact that mortality in this country is very low. And I have two charts that we'll pull up to illustrate that.
The first chart is the case fatality rate in the United States. And as you can see, the mortality rate has gone like this (motions downward) the case fatality rate. And also, in the second chart you'll see hopefully they have it up behind me but the case rate fatality rate in this country vis- -vis other European countries is much lower than, let's say, France and Italy. And what that speaks to is the great work of this administration with therapeutics and remdesivir and dexamethasone. And that's what the President was pointing out.
Q So I want to get back to
MS. MCENANY: Jon.
Q just to follow up quickly, though. So if you don't die, is it not harmless?
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this. Of course, he takes this very seriously. Of course, no one wants to see anyone in this country contract COVID, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that's not the case with our historic response effort.
Jon.
Q Kayleigh, to follow on Peter's question, what is the President's position? Does he think NASCAR made a mistake by banning the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So he said he I spoke to him this morning about this, and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans and those who have gone, and this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when, in fact, the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act. And it very much mirrors other times when there have been a rush to judgment, let's say with the Covington boys or with Jussie Smollett.
Q But let's drill down on the Confederate flag. Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban it?
MS. MCENANY: The President said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other. You're focusing on
Q But what is his position on it?
MS. MCENANY: one word at the very bottom of a tweet that's completely taken out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment on this.
Q Wasn't he saying that NASCAR's rating were down because they banned the flag? That's what he said.
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that, in aggregate, this notion that NASCAR men and women who have gone and who are being demeaned and called racist, and being accused in some venues of committing a hate crime against an individual, those allegations were just dead wrong.
Q Does he think
MS. MCENANY: Paula.
Q Does he think his supporters should not take the flag to Trump rallies? Has he considered banning the Confederate flag from Trump rallies?
MS. MCENANY: Well, at Trump rallies, all flags that are not official campaign gear are banned.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why is it Bubba Wallace's responsibility to apologize for an investigation into a noose that he didn't report and he never even saw? It was NASCAR that found this, that reported this. And even the FBI referred to it as a noose, even if they said it wasn't a specific crime against Mr. Wallace. Why is the President even suggesting that Mr. Wallace should apologize?
MS. MCENANY: Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime, and he believes it'd go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: This was not
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: a hate crime, as noted
Q In interviews, he's been very clear that
MS. MCENANY: by the FBI. So, the President
Q the FBI found this was not intentional.
MS. MCENANY: One of the things
Q Why is he directing this at Mr. Wallace?
MS. MCENANY: So one of the things that
Q He was a victim of a suspected hate crime.
MS. MCENANY: One of this is where the President comes from, and this is where the President stands, and he actually hinted at this in his July 4th speech: ""To those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racist, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity, we want a clear and faithful defense of American history and unity. And when you level false charges, you not only slander me, you slander the American people."" He believes
Q Who was charged? It was an open investigation, Kayleigh
MS. MCENANY: the American people are good. And the allegations
Q into a noose. The FBI said
MS. MCENANY: and the rush to judgement
Q it was a noose.
MS. MCENANY: with Jussie Smollett and the Bubba Wallace case and with the Covington Catholic boys, we shouldn't be so quick to jump onto those narratives. Those are just three examples of those
Q But you're suggesting that Mr. Wallace
MS. MCENANY: that have been proven false.
Yes.
Q should apologize for an investigation that someone else initiated, suggesting he was possibly the victim of a hate crime?
MS. MCENANY: (Calls on next reporter.) Yes.
Q The Governor of South Dakota flew back on Air Force One after having contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus. Why was that allowed to happen? Did she have contact with the President on the trip back? And has the President continued to test negative since that interaction?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, the President is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well.
Q But why the original question is: Why was she to allowed to fly back on Air Force One with the President, when it was known that she had had contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I'd have to refer you to Secret Service on that. But I'll tell you this: They take the President's health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harm's way.
Q And just one follow-up, please.
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q On executive orders, the President has set a pretty brisk pace on those this year. And as a candidate, he had been critical of President Obama's use of executive orders, but he seems to have really stepped up the pace on these. And I wanted to ask, you know, what does he find what is the strategy behind issuing more than one a week so far this year? And I know he's getting ready to issue more in the coming weeks.
MS. MCENANY: Well, he will use the powers in his executive toolkit to further the agenda of the American people. That's his intent with these executive orders. And I would just note that, with regard to the DACA decision, the Supreme Court has suggested he has pretty wide discretion to act.
Yes, Jeff.
Q Hi, Kayleigh. With regard to the President's reference about the 99 percent being harmless, does the President worry at all that by downplaying the severity of the virus, that it will lead Americans to be less careful?
MS. MCENANY: The President isn't downplaying the severity of the virus. What the President is noting is that, at the height of this pandemic, we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where, on July 4th, there were 254; that's a tenfold decrease in mortality. On July 5th, 209 individuals, down 23 percent from last Sunday and the lowest Sunday since March 28th.
The President has made clear: We grieve when just one life is lost, but he wants to note the progress that we've made in treating this very serious virus when we have therapeutics like convalescent plasma, remdesivir, dexamethasone. Convalescent plasma, in particular, was spearheaded by this administration.
He's used he's pulled down bureaucracy and allowed us to get to a place where we can have this declining mortality rate.
Q And just to follow up on the NASCAR thing: You were saying that we're taking the tweet out of context, but this is what he tweeted. He says, ""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers and officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, and were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That and Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""
How how are we misinterpreting that?
MS. MCENANY: I've explained to you this is, I guess, the fourth attempt, but we'll try it again in aggregate, what he was pointing out is this rush to judgment to immediately say that there is a hate crime, as happened in this case, as happened with Jussie Smollett, as happened with the Covington Catholic boys. In an aggregate, those actions made it seem like NASCAR men and women were racist individuals who were roving around and engaging in a hate crime.
The President's intent was to say, no, most American people are good, hardworking people, and we should not have this rush to judgment, kneejerk reaction before the facts come out. The FBI did their job and determined there was no hate crime.
Mario.
Q Is the President comparing Smollett to Wallace?
Q Hold on. Hold on. Just that one thing it wasn't clear in your response and that's why I asked about it again, and it follows up on Paula's question is: Why should Mr. Wallace have to apologize for that when his whole team and all of these colleagues came around him to show support?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, and that's the best of America, is coming around when the media alleged a hate crime; coming around and supporting Bubba Wallace as they should have done. I think that shows how loving NASCAR fans are and the fellow drivers.
But I think it's important that we point out the fact that there was no hate crime; the FBI concluded that. And President Trump was merely saying that Mr. Wallace should agree with that consensus.
Yes, Mario.
Q No, he's saying he has to apologize.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q He's saying he has to apologize. That's what we're trying to ask you, Kayleigh, is
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q why should he have to apologize about that?
MS. MCENANY: I'm not going to answer a question a sixth time.
Mario.
Q But you haven't answered that question. I mean, you've been asked it, but you haven't answered it.
Q You haven't answered it.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, go ahead.
Q Kayleigh, on the Confederate part: Why would the President not praise NASCAR for removing the Confederate flag, particularly given the history of that flag, the symbol that it has for African Americans, and also what it represents in terms of just the treasonous acts and the insurrection against the Republic?
MS. MCENANY: So
Q Why would he not praise them for taking that down, even if it's a ratings (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: The President takes great offense when Americans our kneejerk reaction summed up as racist. And in aggregate, the picture being painted here in this instant incident seemed to be that there was that suggestion there, when, in fact, what we're seeing across the nation is this vast cancel culture where we're going to tear down our monuments, we're going to tear down Gandhi, we're going to tear down George Washington, we're going to tear down Lincoln.
It's really quite appalling what we've seen happen across the country, and the President wants no part in cancel culture. He wants to no part in the tearing down and defacing of Matthias Baldwin, an abolitionist; Philadelphia Civil War soldiers; John Greenleaf Whittier vandalized, an abolitionist. He wants no part in this, and he stands against the demonization of Americans, and he stands firmly on the side of preserving our history.
Yes.
Q But, Kayleigh, the Confederate flag is a different issue.
MS. MCENANY: He's not I said from the very top of this briefing: He has not given an opinion one way or the other on that. I just spoke to him this morning.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why what exactly does the President see as positive or uniting then about the Confederate flag? Why does he why did he decide to tweet about it then, this morning?
MS. MCENANY: The President never used those words. Those are the words of a reporter, not that of the President of the United States.
Q And, Kayleigh, to follow up
MS. MCENANY: Yes, Phil.
Q Thank you. The President argued on Friday, and then again on Saturday, that many of the problems the country faces stem from, quote, ""extreme indoctrination and bias"" in the education system. If that's the case, is he working with Secretary DeVos to address what he sees as a major problem?
You know, what what steps is he taking to (inaudible) this? And could you give us an example?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I'd have to inquire about that, about specific steps that he's taken. I'm not aware of his conversations with Secretary DeVos, but I will certainly follow up.
But, look, we've got a real problem in this country. When you have rioters who I have listed off some of the examples of abolitionists there seems to be zero understanding of history when you're defacing the statue of Matthias Baldwin and John Whittier and Ulysses S. Grant.
There seems to be a lack of understanding and historical knowledge when the Armenian Genocide Memorial, remembering victims of all crimes against humanity including slavery, is vandalized.
There seems to be a lack of understanding of history when the first responders sculpture is damaged, when the Polish war hero statue, the World War I Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and absolutely the Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment Washington [Massachusetts] Memorial that honored African American soldiers who fought valiantly in the Civil War was damaged in Boston. We need to have a better historical understanding.
And I'll follow up with you about specific conversations.
Yes, Toluse.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I have question about masks. The President has, sort of, equivocated on the issue of masks, and we know that a number of Republicans are starting to say that it's the single-most important thing that Americans can do to protect each other. What is the President's message to Americans who hear those messages and say that they simply don't want to wear a mask? What does the President say to those (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: Well, the President was very clear last week that if he were in a situation where he wasn't tested daily and he was in close proximity and unable to social distance, that he would wear a mask. So he has made that clear. At his rally this weekend in New Hampshire, masks are not only handed out but they are recommended.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I wanted to say, first off, point of fact: Bubba Wallace did not make any kind of false report. And I'm wondering, in general, why the President thinks that issue is worth his time and focus right now in the midst of a deadly pandemic? And then also, you've said he has no opinion on the Confederate flag. Why can't this White House unambiguously state whether or not it supports displays of the Confederate flag and
MS. MCENANY: No, I said
Q Confederate monuments, which are much more
MS. MCENANY: I said in his
Q a part of this question than Gandhi?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I said that, you know, he was his tweet was not to indicate approval or disapproval of that particular policy of NASCAR. It was in aggregate to stand against the rush to judgment to call something a hate crime before the facts were out, when clearly the media was wrong about this, when clearly
Q But you said Bubba Wallace made a false report; he didn't.
MS. MCENANY: I never said that. Perhaps one of the reporters said that, but I certainly did not.
But he believes that we should be that the truth matters and that the truth was: The FBI did a thorough investigation, and what was concluded that there was no hate crime here. And we should all be grateful for that; grateful that NASCAR fans came together in a great display of American unity around Mr. Wallace. But then we should also be equally unequivocal about the truth of this situation here and that most Americans are great, hardworking people.
Yes.
Q But why is this cultural stuff worth his time and
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q focus during the pandemic?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, he's focused on two things at once, something we're all capable of doing.
Q And what about on an unambiguous statement on the Confederate flag? Are we capable of doing that?
MS. MCENANY: Look, the President has made clear he was not taking a position one way or the other in that tweet.
Q Exactly. But why not?
MS. MCENANY: Yes. Yes.
Q Thanks, Kayleigh. Two quick questions, if I may. Does the President support the Cleveland Indians and the football team here in Washington considering changing their names?
MS. MCENANY: I haven't spoken to the President on that.
Q And the other question: Who came up with the list of historical figures that the President wants honored in his in his garden of statues that he put out this executive order about? Who came up with the list of people to be included?
MS. MCENANY: So, I don't know exactly who came up with that list. I can ask about it, but it's a pretty extraordinary list of people. I think we can all agree on the fact that great American heroes are people like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr. these are incredible men and women in our history Susan B. Anthony and Billy Graham. So I think we can all pretty much widely acknowledge that these are American heroes.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. The President signed the Payroll Protection Program extension over the weekend. There's $132 billion in the pot. What does the President think that that money should be used for if it's still there after August 8th? And then, in a CARES 4, specifically, what should be there to help small businesses?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don't have any updates on phase four. I've mentioned that the payroll tax is something of great interest to the President because it would help low low- and middle-income Americans most. PPP funding they've done an extraordinary job with that. Small businesses across the country have gotten this, and we've kept people on payroll. So he's very pleased with the progress that's been made there and the continuing functioning of the PPP.
Yes.
Q Would he veto a bill then that did not have the payroll tax relief in it?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I don't want to set parameters or conditions. That'll be up to the President when the bill arrives on his desk.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh, so much. As President Trump wants to reopen the country, what will be the criteria to cancel the travel bans? Because we know that the bans are still in place for European countries where the situation is under control. And, on the other hand, there is no ban on hotspots like Russia, India, or Mexico, for example. So what is the criteria?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don't have specific criteria to give you. I'd have to refer you to the State Department and Secretary Pompeo, and his remarks on the topic during his last press conference, as where we currently stand.
But President Trump and the administration have taken bold, decisive, and frequent action to secure our homeland, and a big part of that has been these travel restrictions. And we're working with countries around the world, and we hope to have a day where international travel is open. But right now, this is about putting America first.
And I want to say this
Q Kayleigh, can I ask one more question?
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q European countries, and now the UK, are starting to open for touring visitors, but the U.S. is still banned. How do you think the world is looking at the United States right now?
MS. MCENANY: I think the world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19, because the chart I showed you, where you have mortality rate and Italy and UK up here and across Europe, and you have the United States at a low case mortality rate it's because of the extraordinary work that we've done on therapeutics and getting PPE and leading on ventilators and having excess ventilators that we were able to deploy around the world and help other countries. So that's what I would have to say on COVID.
And finally, I'd end with this: You know, I was asked probably 12 questions about the Confederate flag. This President is focused on action, and I'm a little dismayed that I didn't receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend. I didn't receive one question about New York City shootings doubling for the third straight week. And over the last seven days, shootings skyrocketed by 142 percent. Not one question. I didn't receive one question about five children who were killed.
And I'll leave you with this remark by a dad it broke my heart a dad of an eight-year-old lost in Atlanta this weekend: They say black lives matter...you killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody, was his quote.
We need to be focused on securing our streets, making sure no lives are lost because all black lives matter that of David Dorn and that of this eight-year-old girl.
Thank you.

After Terror Attacks, Muslims Wonder About Their Place in France
Wait, who got attacked? The Wall Street Journal, October 29:
A knife-wielding man killed three people - nearly decapitating one of them - in the Notre Dame Basilica in Nice, police said, in an assault being treated as an act of terrorism ... (Police) encountered the alleged attacker, who shouted ""Allahu akbar"" before being shot ... Police found a knife with a seven-inch blade, two telephones and a copy of the Quran.
Oh, different attack! More from the NYT:
French officials' attack on ""Islamic separatism"" and the ""enemy within"" has Muslims questioning whether they will ever fully be accepted.
Even so, there were Muslims who refrained from casting ""Islamophobia"" as an attacker. AP, October 30:
 The French Council of the Muslim Faith called on French Muslims to refrain from festivities marking the birth of Muhammad ""as a sign of mourning and in solidarity with the families of victims and the Catholics of France"".
Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad disrupted the measured civility of Twitter, October 29:
Muslims have a right to be angry and to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past (tweet since taken down).
Not that Mahathir was giving his blessing to the decapitation of French teacher Samuel Paty, Twitter, October 29:
The killing is not an act that as a Muslim I would approve. But while I believe in the freedom of expression, I do not think it includes insulting other people. You cannot go up to a man and curse him simply because you believe in freedom of speech.
A bit of respect, is that so hard? More Mahathir:
 Generally, the West no longer adhere to their own religion. They are Christians in name only. That is their right. But they must not show disrespect for the values of others, for the religion of others. It is a measure of the level of their civilisation to show this respect.
More NYT:
French officials have vowed to crack down on what the hardline interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, has called ""the enemy within"", closing a mosque, proposing to ban several Muslim groups the government considers extremist and even suggesting the elimination of ethnic food aisles in stores. Mr Macron, who began a campaign earlier this month against Islamic ""separatism"" from France's deeply held secular values, said recently that Muslims needed to develop an ""Islam of enlightenment"", which many considered patronising.
Lack of respect may even be a sign of mental ill-health, ABC News, October 26:
Turkish President Erdogan says French President Emmanuel Macron needs mental ""treatment"" over response to beheading ... Mr Erdogan said the French leader needed mental help for condoning the (Charlie Hebdo) caricatures (of the Prophet). ""What is the problem of this person called Macron with Muslims and Islam? Macron needs treatment on a mental level,"" Mr Erdogan said.

The resolution, passed with 243 lawmakers in support, calls for officials to denounce all acts of anti-Asian sentiment and discrimination amid the pandemic. The measure, sponsored by Democrat Grace Meng of New York, also requests that law enforcement take actions to better address hate crimes against Asian Americans, such as to ""expeditiously investigate and document"" anti-Asian incidents and to maintain data to trace impact.
Though the resolution passed, 164 Republicans voted against it. The party dismissed the measure as ""woke culture on steroids"" and accused Democrats of merely attempting to extend their efforts to rebuke President Donald Trump months before the November election.
Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California called the Republicans ""disgraceful"" and accused the president of ""fueling racism and inspiring violent attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants.""
As COVID cases continue to rise in America, Trump has repeatedly blamed China for the pandemic. He often uses terms such as ""Chinese Virus,"" ""Wuhan Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"" to associate the disease with the Asian nation, where it was first detected.
While the House measure didn't name Trump, it does say that such inflammatory language has fanned the flames of racism and anti-Asian American stigma.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of demonizing China to distract citizens from his allegedly dismal coronavirus response and Russia election meddling. She also noted that the president's rhetoric comes amid a ""disturbing epidemic of hate and discrimination"" against Asians.
The U.S. has experienced a surge in racially motivated hate crimes against Asian Americans since the COVID outbreak was first identified last December in Wuhan, China. In July, the University of Colorado Denver School of Public Affairs released a research report establishing how the disease has perpetuated domestic xenophobia, racism and fear of foreigners.
Republicans defended their vote by insisting that Trump's aggression was directly toward the Chinese government and not to Asians. In March, the president clarified that Asian Americans should not be blamed for the ""Chinese virus"" amid escalating reports of violence against the community. ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world,"" he said.
Republican House Minority Leader of California rejected the resolution as a ""waste of time"" and distraction from stimulus deadlock.
""At the heart of this resolution is the absurd notion that referring to the virus as a Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as contributing to violence against Asian Americans,"" he said,"" which I will tell you no one on this side of the aisle supports.""
Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan accused the Democrats of using the measure as an ""opportunity"" to score political points.
Newsweek reached out to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for further comment.

freely be themselves when they are with their family or friends or colleagues at work, so that's why they need to sometimes go out and meet people who are in the same position or, you know, share similar stories, so it is very vital for LGBTQ people to have these spaces. When this outbreak became public, the South Korean government wants to track and trace everyone who's infected, to try to stop the virus spreading. Why was that a real problem in Itaewon? So, these clubs and bars actually took their visitors' and customers' names and cellphone numbers and where they live. 
A lot of the people didn't write their information correctly because the fear of being outed, because once they are tracked down and get tested, and if the results were positive, then the information will be revealed on the internet, without the name, but just enough information for people to...so people can guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you here because you are talking about risk, you're talking about a risk to public health if people don't give their names and people aren't traced, but you are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a real struggle there, or do some people have a real struggle with this? For being out and proud activists and artists, but there are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists who work for LGBTQ organisations, many of them are not out, and they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. Heezy Yang, before coronavirus, do you think things were getting easier? When you talk about Pride gatherings and parades in Seoul, for example, was that possible, were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general, things seemed to be going well, and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the festival for about 10 years now, and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2,000 or 3,000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big, and there have been more media coverage about LGBTQ people in general, and mainstream media, and K-pop even included, not, like, very out and loud but subtly, they included more queer and LGBTQ factors and culture little by little, so things seemed to be going to the right direction but then this one outbreak happened and people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually as good as they seemed, or there have always been problems. Heezy Yang in South Korea. You are watching coronavirus: Your Stories. I'm Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American basis. -- a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American faces. So I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store a day after the shelter-in-place order was officially announced here in New York City, and there were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me so close to the point where I could almost I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, BLEEP?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans since Trump had made his first reference to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research, I found several Facebook groups where Asian-Americans were self-reporting incidents"

192,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The New York Times - International Edition",2020-10-28,"981 words","OPINION","Bret Stephens",NA,"Anti-Semitism and What Feeds It",FALSE,"Two years after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, the oldest hatred is flourishing across the political spectrum. 
On Oct. 27, 2018, a man armed with a semiautomatic rifle and three pistols entered Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue and murdered 11 congregants. In addition to raging anti-Semitism, the killer had a more immediate motive: fury that the synagogue had participated in the National Refugee Shabbat, sponsored by the humanitarian group HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. 
""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,"" he wrote on a social network. ""I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."" 
The killer's immigration obsession, emerging from the same bonfire of bigotries that President Trump had stoked for years, led many people, including me, to conclude that the president could not be excused from what had happened in Pittsburgh. Anti-Semitism flourishes when adjacent hatreds - of ""globalists,"" ""corporate media,"" ""Hollywood"" and so on - cease to be taboo. Anti-Semitism also flourishes when the purveyors of these adjacencies cease to be disreputable. 
What goes for the right and its uglier obsessions goes also for the left, in ways the left is sometimes loath to recognize. 
There are writers who strain to make the case that anti-Zionism cannot be conflated with anti-Semitism. But when a gunman murders four French Jews in a Paris market in part because he's mad about the plight of Palestinians, it becomes clear that anti-Zionism can bleed into anti-Semitism. 
There are left-wing party leaders who think a public mural depicting elderly bankers playing Monopoly on the backs of naked figures is just a critique of rapacious capitalism. Those who notice the prominent noses on the bankers have reason to think otherwise. 
There are cultural arbiters ready to cancel anyone's careers over bigotry - except when, say, the rapper Ice Cube or the N.F.L. player DeSean Jackson, or the N.B.A. player Stephen Jackson posts anti-Semitic messages on social media. 
""Given the new woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world, we expected more passionate public outrage,"" the basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sharply observed last summer. ""What we got was a shrug of meh-rage."" 
There are magazine editors who are racing to live down a reputation for indifference to - or worse, perpetuation of - racism inside their publications. But when one of these same magazines publishes a flattering profile of Louis Farrakhan devotee Tamika Mallory with pious attention to her social activism but no mention of her acceptance of Farrakhan's anti-Semitism it passes without comment or objection on the left. 
There are leading left-wing political activists who claim that Israel ""is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else,"" implying that any form of Zionism, including progressive Zionism, is inherently sympathetic to white supremacy. But when a Jewish undergraduate is hounded off a student council (""Impeach her Zionist ass,"" according to the social media campaign against her) she may understandably wonder whether the hoary equivalence of Zionism and racism hasn't become another pretext to target Jews. 
The list goes on. In the months after the Pittsburgh massacre, I sometimes heard the argument that Jews had far more to fear from the anti-Semitism of the Charlottesville right - which, after all, had led to the shedding of human blood in Pittsburgh and later at a synagogue in Poway, Calif. - than from the anti-Semitic ""microaggressions"" from other quarters. Mainstream media reports added to the perception that the rise in hate crimes, including crimes against Jews, was overwhelmingly a function of right-wing hate. 
But then a tsunami of anti-Semitic assaults came crashing down on the Orthodox communities in New York, largely perpetrated by ""young men of color,"" according to The Times. And then five people were murdered in two separate terrorist attacks in Jersey City and Monsey, N.Y. In neither of these fatal attacks against Jews were white supremacists involved. 
All of this should serve as stark reminders that when it comes to anti-Semitism, neither left nor right nor Black nor white has any kind of monopoly. No less important, no side is free of political leanings that are, if not anti-Semitic, then perilously close to it. The Trumpian right's obsession with border walls, protective tariffs and drastic cuts to legal immigration is a vehicle for a toxic brand of American nationalism that over time cannot bode well for American Jews. 
But the left's fetish with pyramids of privilege and intersections of oppression is just as toxic, if not more, considering the broad success of American Jews in the ladders of educational, economic and cultural attainment. Whenever the success or merit of a minority group turns into a presumption of social guilt - whether it was the Asian community in Idi Amin's Uganda, the Chinese in Suharto's Indonesia, or Jews in Weimar Germany - the consequences tend to be catastrophic. 
Two years ago, a once-unthinkable attack became an all-too-thinkable possibility for every synagogue in America. In itself, Pittsburgh should serve as a permanent reminder of how easily the politics of demonizing immigrants can lead to killing Jews. 
But the broader lesson is that any ideology that borders on anti-Semitism can easily descend toward it. And anyone who isn't calling out his own side as much as the other speeds that descent.

Northam Commemorates Pride Month as New Laws Advancing LGBTQ Rights Take Effect in Virginia",FALSE,"Gov. Ralph S. Northam, R-Virginia, issued the following news release:
Governor Ralph Northam is commemorating Pride Month in Virginia as sweeping new laws to expand rights and protections for LQBTQ+ individuals take effect on July 1. At the beginning of the month, the Governor issued a proclamation declaring June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month in the Commonwealth of Virginia to celebrate the state's LGBTQ+ communities and their fight for inclusion and equality.
""This Pride Month, we are reminded of the pivotal moments when LGBTQ+ Americans stood up to demand that they be treated with respect and dignity,"" said Governor Northam. ""As we celebrate long-overdue progress in advancing LGBTQ+ rights in our country and Commonwealth, we must also redouble our efforts to ensure Virginia is inclusive and welcoming to all--no matter who you are, who you love, or how you identify.""
Each June, Pride Month commemorates the riots at Stonewall Inn in New York City that began on June 28, 1969, and mark the birth of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.
Pride Month also celebrates several landmark rulings from the United States Supreme Court that upheld LGBTQ+ rights and advanced equality in the United States, including decisions that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, which guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry, and affirmed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects LGBTQ+ employees from discrimination based on sex in 2020.
During the last legislative session, Governor Northam took historic action to expand rights and protections for LGBTQ+ Virginians. He signed the Virginia Values Act, making Virginia the first state in the South to enact comprehensive protections for the LGBTQ+ community against discrimination in housing, employment, public spaces, and credit applications.
Governor Northam also signed legislation banning the harmful and controversial practice of ""conversion therapy"" for minors, which attempts to forcibly change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. And he signed new measures that increase protections for transgender students in Virginia public schools, give localities greater authority to ban discrimination, expand the definition of a hate crime to include criminal acts based gender identity and sexual orientation, and make it easier for LGBTQ+ individuals to obtain a birth certificate that matches their gender identity. These laws will become effective July 1, 2020.
On Saturday, June 27, Governor Northam will join LGBTQ+ activists and world leaders for Global Pride 2020, a 24-hour virtual Pride event organized in response to the hundreds of Pride celebrations that have been cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Governor's pre-recorded message will air between 4:30 PM and 6:30 PM Eastern. See the full line up of speakers and performers here https://www.globalpride2020.org/watch/.

is the biggest religion, so people cannot be, freely be themselves when they are with their family or friends or colleagues at work, so that's why they need to sometimes go out and meet people who are in the same position or, you know, share similar stories, so it is very vital for LGBTQ people to have these spaces. When this outbreak became public, the South Korean government wants to track and trace everyone who's infected, to try to stop the virus spreading. Why was that a real problem in Itaewon? So, these clubs and bars actually took their visitors' and customers' names and cellphone numbers and where they live. 
A lot of the people didn't write their information correctly because the fear of being outed, because once they are tracked down and get tested, and if the results were positive, then the information will be revealed on the internet, without the name, but just enough information for people to...so people can guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you here because you are talking about risk, you're talking about a risk to public health if people don't give their names and people aren't traced, but you are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a real struggle there, or do some people have a real struggle with this? For being out and proud activists and artists, but there are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists who work for LGBTQ organisations, many of them are not out, and they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. Heezy Yang, before coronavirus, do you think things were getting easier? When you talk about Pride gatherings and parades in Seoul, for example, was that possible, were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general, things seemed to be going well, and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the festival for about 10 years now, and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2,000 or 3,000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big, and there have been more media coverage about LGBTQ people in general, and mainstream media, and K-pop even included, not, like, very out and loud but subtly, they included more queer and LGBTQ factors and culture little by little, so things seemed to be going to the right direction but then this one outbreak happened and people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually as good as they seemed, or there have always been problems. Heezy Yang in South Korea. You are watching coronavirus: Your Stories. I'm Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American faces. So I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store a day after the shelter-in-place order was officially announced here in New York City, and there were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me so close to the point where I could almost feel his breath, and he didn't have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, BLEEP?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans since Trump had made his first reference to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident?

MS. MCENANY: All right. Hello, everyone. Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future. The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities. President Trump said, ""After all, what do we want? We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order."" He went on to say, ""We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world."" He went on to say, ""We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things?""
This message is now more important and more timely than ever. Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials -- everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi. Misguided movements, such as ""Defund the Police,"" seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever. Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country. An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families. Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, ""Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation...We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so...they can build its future.""
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it's an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I'll take questions.
Peter.
Q Kayleigh, I want to ask you just a couple questions. The first one: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So I think you're referring to a tweet this morning. Is that right?
Q Correct.
MS. MCENANY: Well, I think you're mischaracterizing the tweet. The tweet was aimed at pointing out that the FBI report of the alleged hate crime at NASCAR concluded that the garage door pull, which had been there since last fall, was obviously not targeted at a specific individual because, in fact, it was a garage pull and, in fact, it was there since last fall, long before these 43 teams arrived. And it was concluded by the FBI that this was, quote, ""not an intentional racist act.""
Q For clarity, I'm asking you about the Confederate flags. My question is: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: The President never said that. Again, you're taking his tweet completely out of context.
Q The President said that NASCAR saw bad ratings because they took down the Confederate flag, banned the Confederate flag. Does he believe NASCAR should fly the Confederate flag? And why don't they fly it here?
MS. MCENANY: The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that, in fact, was not a hate crime. At the very end, the ban on the flag was mentioned in the broader context of the fact that he rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women who go to these sporting events are racist when, in fact, as it turns out, what we saw with the FBI report and the alleged incident of a hate crime -- it was a complete indictment of the media's rush to judgment once again, calling this a hate crime when the FBI completely dismissed that.
Q Let me ask you about some of the President's comments this weekend. The President said that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless. Which members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force agree with that statement?
MS. MCENANY: So what the President was pointing to -- and I'm glad you brought it up -- was a factual statement, one that is rooted in science and one that was pointing out the fact that mortality in this country is very low. And I have two charts that we'll pull up to illustrate that.
The first chart is the case fatality rate in the United States. And as you can see, the mortality rate has gone like this -- (motions downward) -- the case fatality rate. And also, in the second chart you'll see -- hopefully they have it up behind me -- but the case rate -- fatality rate in this country vis-a-vis other European countries is much lower than, let's say, France and Italy. And what that speaks to is the great work of this administration with therapeutics and remdesivir and dexamethasone. And that's what the President was pointing out.
Q So I want to get back to --
MS. MCENANY: Jon.
Q -- just to follow up quickly, though. So if you don't die, is it not harmless?
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this. Of course, he takes this very seriously. Of course, no one wants to see anyone in this country contract COVID, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that's not the case with our historic response effort.
Jon.
Q Kayleigh, to follow on Peter's question, what is the President's position? Does he think NASCAR made a mistake by banning the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So he said he -- I spoke to him this morning about this, and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans and those who have gone, and this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when, in fact, the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act. And it very much mirrors other times when there have been a rush to judgment, let's say with the Covington boys or with Jussie Smollett.
Q But let's drill down on the Confederate flag. Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban it?
MS. MCENANY: The President said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other. You're focusing on --
Q But what is his position on it?
MS. MCENANY: -- one word at the very bottom of a tweet that's completely taken out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment on this.
Q Wasn't he saying that NASCAR's rating were down because they banned the flag? That's what he said.
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that, in aggregate, this notion that NASCAR men and women who have gone and who are being demeaned and called racist, and being accused in some venues of committing a hate crime against an individual, those allegations were just dead wrong.
Q Does he think --
MS. MCENANY: Paula.
Q Does he think his supporters should not take the flag to Trump rallies? Has he considered banning the Confederate flag from Trump rallies?
MS. MCENANY: Well, at Trump rallies, all flags that are not official campaign gear are banned.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why is it Bubba Wallace's responsibility to apologize for an investigation into a noose that he didn't report and he never even saw? It was NASCAR that found this, that reported this. And even the FBI referred to it as a noose, even if they said it wasn't a specific crime against Mr. Wallace. Why is the President even suggesting that Mr. Wallace should apologize?
MS. MCENANY: Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime, and he believes it'd go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well --
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: This was not --
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: -- a hate crime, as noted --
Q In interviews, he's been very clear that --
MS. MCENANY: -- by the FBI. So, the President --
Q -- the FBI found this was not intentional.
MS. MCENANY: One of the things --
Q Why is he directing this at Mr. Wallace?
MS. MCENANY: So one of the things that --
Q He was a victim of a suspected hate crime.
MS. MCENANY: One of -- this is where the President comes from, and this is where the President stands, and he actually hinted at this in his July 4th speech: ""To those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racist, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity, we want a clear and faithful defense of American history and unity. And when you level false charges, you not only slander me, you slander the American people."" He believes --
Q Who was charged? It was an open investigation, Kayleigh --
MS. MCENANY: -- the American people are good. And the allegations --
Q -- into a noose. The FBI said --
MS. MCENANY: -- and the rush to judgement --
Q -- it was a noose.
MS. MCENANY: -- with Jussie Smollett and the Bubba Wallace case and with the Covington Catholic boys, we shouldn't be so quick to jump onto those narratives. Those are just three examples of those --
Q But you're suggesting that Mr. Wallace --
MS. MCENANY: that have been proven false.
Yes.
Q -- should apologize for an investigation that someone else initiated, suggesting he was possibly the victim of a hate crime?
MS. MCENANY: (Calls on next reporter.) Yes.
Q The Governor of South Dakota flew back on Air Force One after having contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus. Why was that allowed to happen? Did she have contact with the President on the trip back? And has the President continued to test negative since that interaction?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, the President is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well.
Q But why -- the original question is: Why was she to allowed to fly back on Air Force One with the President, when it was known that she had had contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I'd have to refer you to Secret Service on that. But I'll tell you this: They take the President's health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harm's way.
Q And just one follow-up, please.
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q On executive orders, the President has set a pretty brisk pace on those this year. And as a candidate, he had been critical of President Obama's use of executive orders, but he seems to have really stepped up the pace on these. And I wanted to ask, you know, what does he find -- what is the strategy behind issuing more than one a week so far this year? And I know he's getting ready to issue more in the coming weeks.
MS. MCENANY: Well, he will use the powers in his executive toolkit to further the agenda of the American people. That's his intent with these executive orders. And I would just note that, with regard to the DACA decision, the Supreme Court has suggested he has pretty wide discretion to act.
Yes, Jeff.
Q Hi, Kayleigh. With regard to the President's reference about the 99 percent being harmless, does the President worry at all that by downplaying the severity of the virus, that it will lead Americans to be less careful?
MS. MCENANY: The President isn't downplaying the severity of the virus. What the President is noting is that, at the height of this pandemic, we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where, on July 4th, there were 254; that's a tenfold decrease in mortality. On July 5th, 209 individuals, down 23 percent from last Sunday and the lowest Sunday since March 28th.
The President has made clear: We grieve when just one life is lost, but he wants to note the progress that we've made in treating this very serious virus when we have therapeutics like convalescent plasma, remdesivir, dexamethasone. Convalescent plasma, in particular, was spearheaded by this administration.
He's used -- he's pulled down bureaucracy and allowed us to get to a place where we can have this declining mortality rate.
Q And just to follow up on the NASCAR thing: You were saying that we're taking the tweet out of context, but this is what he tweeted. He says, ""Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""
How -- how are we misinterpreting that?
MS. MCENANY: I've explained to you -- this is, I guess, the fourth attempt, but we'll try it again -- in aggregate, what he was pointing out is this rush to judgment to immediately say that there is a hate crime, as happened in this case, as happened with Jussie Smollett, as happened with the Covington Catholic boys. In an aggregate, those actions made it seem like NASCAR men and women were racist individuals who were roving around and engaging in a hate crime.
The President's intent was to say, no, most American people are good, hardworking people, and we should not have this rush to judgment, kneejerk reaction before the facts come out. The FBI did their job and determined there was no hate crime.
Mario.
Q Is the President comparing Smollett to Wallace?
Q Hold on. Hold on. Just that one thing it wasn't clear in your response -- and that's why I asked about it again, and it follows up on Paula's question -- is: Why should Mr. Wallace have to apologize for that when his whole team and all of these colleagues came around him to show support?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, and that's the best of America, is coming around when the media alleged a hate crime; coming around and supporting Bubba Wallace as they should have done. I think that shows how loving NASCAR fans are and the fellow drivers.
But I think it's important that we point out the fact that there was no hate crime; the FBI concluded that. And President Trump was merely saying that Mr. Wallace should agree with that consensus.
Yes, Mario.
Q No, he's saying he has to apologize.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q He's saying he has to apologize. That's what we're trying to ask you, Kayleigh, is --
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q -- why should he have to apologize about that?
MS. MCENANY: I'm not going to answer a question a sixth time.
Mario.
Q But you haven't answered that question. I mean, you've been asked it, but you haven't answered it.
Q You haven't answered it.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, go ahead.
Q Kayleigh, on the Confederate part: Why would the President not praise NASCAR for removing the Confederate flag, particularly given the history of that flag, the symbol that it has for African Americans, and also what it represents in terms of just the treasonous acts and the insurrection against the Republic?
MS. MCENANY: So --
Q Why would he not praise them for taking that down, even if it's a ratings (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: The President takes great offense when Americans -- our kneejerk reaction summed up as racist. And in aggregate, the picture being painted here in this instant -- incident seemed to be that there was that suggestion there, when, in fact, what we're seeing across the nation is this vast cancel culture where we're going to tear down our monuments, we're going to tear down Gandhi, we're going to tear down George Washington, we're going to tear down Lincoln.
It's really quite appalling what we've seen happen across the country, and the President wants no part in cancel culture. He wants to no part in the tearing down and defacing of Matthias Baldwin, an abolitionist; Philadelphia Civil War soldiers; John Greenleaf Whittier vandalized, an abolitionist. He wants no part in this, and he stands against the demonization of Americans, and he stands firmly on the side of preserving our history.
Yes.
Q But, Kayleigh, the Confederate flag is a different issue.
MS. MCENANY: He's not -- I said from the very top of this briefing: He has not given an opinion one way or the other on that. I just spoke to him this morning.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why -- what exactly does the President see as positive or uniting then about the Confederate flag? Why does he -- why did he decide to tweet about it then, this morning?
MS. MCENANY: The President never used those words. Those are the words of a reporter, not that of the President of the United States.
Q And, Kayleigh, to follow up --
MS. MCENANY: Yes, Phil.
Q Thank you. The President argued on Friday, and then again on Saturday, that many of the problems the country faces stem from, quote, ""extreme indoctrination and bias"" in the education system. If that's the case, is he working with Secretary DeVos to address what he sees as a major problem?
You know, what -- what steps is he taking to (inaudible) this? And could you give us an example?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I'd have to inquire about that, about specific steps that he's taken. I'm not aware of his conversations with Secretary DeVos, but I will certainly follow up.
But, look, we've got a real problem in this country. When you have rioters who -- I have listed off some of the examples of abolitionists -- there seems to be zero understanding of history when you're defacing the statue of Matthias Baldwin and John Whittier and Ulysses S. Grant.
There seems to be a lack of understanding and historical knowledge when the Armenian Genocide Memorial, remembering victims of all crimes against humanity including slavery, is vandalized.
There seems to be a lack of understanding of history when the first responders sculpture is damaged, when the Polish war hero statue, the World War I Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and absolutely the Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment Washington [Massachusetts] Memorial that honored African American soldiers who fought valiantly in the Civil War was damaged in Boston. We need to have a better historical understanding.
And I'll follow up with you about specific conversations.
Yes, Toluse.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I have question about masks. The President has, sort of, equivocated on the issue of masks, and we know that a number of Republicans are starting to say that it's the single-most important thing that Americans can do to protect each other. What is the President's message to Americans who hear those messages and say that they simply don't want to wear a mask? What does the President say to those (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: Well, the President was very clear last week that if he were in a situation where he wasn't tested daily and he was in close proximity and unable to social distance, that he would wear a mask. So he has made that clear. At his rally this weekend in New Hampshire, masks are not only handed out but they are recommended.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I wanted to say, first off, point of fact: Bubba Wallace did not make any kind of false report. And I'm wondering, in general, why the President thinks that issue is worth his time and focus right now in the midst of a deadly pandemic? And then also, you've said he has no opinion on the Confederate flag. Why can't this White House unambiguously state whether or not it supports displays of the Confederate flag and --
MS. MCENANY: No, I said --
Q -- Confederate monuments, which are much more --
MS. MCENANY: I said in his --
Q -- a part of this question than Gandhi?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I said that, you know, he was -- his tweet was not to indicate approval or disapproval of that particular policy of NASCAR. It was in aggregate to stand against the rush to judgment to call something a hate crime before the facts were out, when clearly the media was wrong about this, when clearly --
Q But you said Bubba Wallace made a false report; he didn't.
MS. MCENANY: I never said that. Perhaps one of the reporters said that, but I certainly did not.
But he believes that we should be -- that the truth matters and that the truth was: The FBI did a thorough investigation, and what was concluded -- that there was no hate crime here. And we should all be grateful for that; grateful that NASCAR fans came together in a great display of American unity around Mr. Wallace. But then we should also be equally unequivocal about the truth of this situation here and that most Americans are great, hardworking people.
Yes.
Q But why is this cultural stuff worth his time and --
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q -- focus during the pandemic?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, he's focused on two things at once, something we're all capable of doing.
Q And what about on an unambiguous statement on the Confederate flag? Are we capable of doing that?
MS. MCENANY: Look, the President has made clear he was not taking a position one way or the other in that tweet.
Q Exactly. But why not?
MS. MCENANY: Yes. Yes.
Q Thanks, Kayleigh. Two quick questions, if I may. Does the President support the Cleveland Indians and the football team here in Washington considering changing their names?
MS. MCENANY: I haven't spoken to the President on that.
Q And the other question: Who came up with the list of historical figures that the President wants honored in his -- in his garden of statues that he put out this executive order about? Who came up with the list of people to be included?
MS. MCENANY: So, I don't know exactly who came up with that list. I can ask about it, but it's a pretty extraordinary list of people. I think we can all agree on the fact that great American heroes are people like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr. -- these are incredible men and women in our history -- Susan B. Anthony and Billy Graham. So I think we can all pretty much widely acknowledge that these are American heroes.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. The President signed the Payroll Protection Program extension over the weekend. There's $132 billion in the pot. What does the President think that that money should be used for if it's still there after August 8th? And then, in a CARES 4, specifically, what should be there to help small businesses?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don't have any updates on phase four. I've mentioned that the payroll tax is something of great interest to the President because it would help low -- low- and middle-income Americans most. PPP funding -- they've done an extraordinary job with that. Small businesses across the country have gotten this, and we've kept people on payroll. So he's very pleased with the progress that's been made there and the continuing functioning of the PPP.
Yes.
Q Would he veto a bill then that did not have the payroll tax relief in it?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I don't want to set parameters or conditions. That'll be up to the President when the bill arrives on his desk.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh, so much. As President Trump wants to reopen the country, what will be the criteria to cancel the travel bans? Because we know that the bans are still in place for European countries where the situation is under control. And, on the other hand, there is no ban on hotspots like Russia, India, or Mexico, for example. So what is the criteria?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don't have specific criteria to give you. I'd have to refer you to the State Department and Secretary Pompeo, and his remarks on the topic during his last press conference, as where we currently stand.
But President Trump and the administration have taken bold, decisive, and frequent action to secure our homeland, and a big part of that has been these travel restrictions. And we're working with countries around the world, and we hope to have a day where international travel is open. But right now, this is about putting America first.
And I want to say this --
Q Kayleigh, can I ask one more question?
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q European countries, and now the UK, are starting to open for touring visitors, but the U.S. is still banned. How do you think the world is looking at the United States right now?
MS. MCENANY: I think the world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19, because the chart I showed you, where you have mortality rate -- and Italy and UK up here and across Europe, and you have the United States at a low case mortality rate -- it's because of the extraordinary work that we've done on therapeutics and getting PPE and leading on ventilators and having excess ventilators that we were able to deploy around the world and help other countries. So that's what I would have to say on COVID.
And finally, I'd end with this: You know, I was asked probably 12 questions about the Confederate flag. This President is focused on action, and I'm a little dismayed that I didn't receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend. I didn't receive one question about New York City shootings doubling for the third straight week. And over the last seven days, shootings skyrocketed by 142 percent. Not one question. I didn't receive one question about five children who were killed.
And I'll leave you with this remark by a dad -- it broke my heart -- a dad of an eight-year-old lost in Atlanta this weekend: ""They say black lives matter...you killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody,"" was his quote.
We need to be focused on securing our streets, making sure no lives are lost because all black lives matter -- that of David Dorn and that of this eight-year-old girl.
Thank you.

when they are with their family or friends or colleagues at work, so that's why they need to sometimes go out and meet people who are in the same position or, you know, share similar stories, so it is very vital for LGBTQ people to have these spaces. When this outbreak became public, the South Korean government wants to track and trace everyone who's infected, to try to stop the virus spreading. Why was that a real problem in Itaewon? So, these clubs and bars actually took their visitors' and customers' names and cellphone numbers and where they live. 
A lot of the people didn't write their information correctly because the fear of being outed, because once they are tracked down and get tested, and if the results were positive, then the information will be revealed on the internet, without the name, but just enough information for people to...so people can guess who these people are. I can see the struggle for you here because you are talking about risk, you're talking about a risk to public health if people don't give their names and people aren't traced, but you are also talking about a risk of being outed. Are you feeling a real struggle there, or do some people have a real struggle with this? For being out and proud activists and artists, but there are a lot of friends of mine, even artists or activists who work for LGBTQ organisations, many of them are not out, and they still have to lie about their sexuality or sexual orientation to their family, their parents. Heezy Yang, before coronavirus, do you think things were getting easier? When you talk about Pride gatherings and parades in Seoul, for example, was that possible, were those gatherings getting bigger before the virus? In general, things seemed to be going well, and going towards the right direction because Seoul Pride had been going to the festival for about 10 years now, and the first time I went there, the size of it was approximately 2,000 or 3,000 people but last year, they had over 120,000 people so the size of it has become really big, and there have been more media coverage about LGBTQ people in general, and mainstream media, and K-pop even included, not, like, very out and loud but subtly, they included more queer and LGBTQ factors and culture little by little, so things seemed to be going to the right direction but then this one outbreak happened and people had to face, they had to face the fact that things weren't actually as good as they seemed, or there have always been problems. Heezy Yang in South Korea. You are watching Coronavirus: Your Stories. I'm Philippa Thomas and we are looking this week at virus and prejudice. Next, a young photographer in New York City sees a rise in abuse directed at Asian-American basis. So I was waiting in line to enter a grocery store a day after the shelter-in-place order was officially announced here in New York City, and there were clear signs for social distancing but the man behind me was hovering right behind me so close to the point where I could almost feel his breath, and he didn't have a mask on. I politely asked him for some space to which he responded, ""What did you say to me, chink?"" And proceeded to cut in front of me. At this point, I was already anticipating an increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans since Trump had made his first reference to a Chinese virus about four days prior to my incident but I wanted to believe my experience was kind of an isolated incident since I live in such a racially and culturally diverse city like New York City. So Haruka, that happened to you, and then you start asking around and realise this isn't an isolated incident? Right, so I started to realise that there was a pattern of these incidents and I started to do some research,"

James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:29 P.M EDT
MS. MCENANY: All right. Hello, everyone. Over the holiday weekend, President Trump delivered two defining, unifying, and patriotic speeches, which drew widespread praise by those who cherish our values, honor our history, and seek to advance policies that lift up all Americans.
The President outlined a vision for the future. The President outlined a vision for stronger and safer communities. President Trump said, “After all, what do we want? We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order.” He went on to say, “We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in the great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world.” He went on to say, “We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things?”
This message is now more important and more timely than ever. Radical left-wing mobs seek to tear down our monuments and our memorials — everyone from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln to Frederick Douglass, and even Gandhi. Misguided movements, such as “Defund the Police,” seek to leave our communities more vulnerable than ever. Case in point: This weekend alone, in New York, there were 44 shootings with 11 killed; in Chicago, 75 people were shot with 13 killed; and tragically, at least five of these individuals were children who were killed in cities across the country. An absolutely devastating loss, and we grieve for those families. Crimes such as this is dark and it is divisive.
This July 4th, the President said, “Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation…We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so…they can build its future.”
This vision is not a culture war, as the media seeks to falsely proclaim; it’s an embrace of our American family, our values, our freedom, and our future.
And with that, I’ll take questions.
Peter.
Q Kayleigh, I want to ask you just a couple questions. The first one: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So I think you’re referring to a tweet this morning. Is that right?
Q Correct.
MS. MCENANY: Well, I think you’re mischaracterizing the tweet. The tweet was aimed at pointing out that the FBI report of the alleged hate crime at NASCAR concluded that the garage door pull, which had been there since last fall, was obviously not targeted at a specific individual because, in fact, it was a garage pull and, in fact, it was there since last fall, long before these 43 teams arrived. And it was concluded by the FBI that this was, quote, “not an intentional racist act.”
Q For clarity, I’m asking you about the Confederate flags. My question is: Why is the President so supportive of flying the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: The President never said that. Again, you’re taking his tweet completely out of context.
Q The President said that NASCAR saw bad ratings because they took down the Confederate flag, banned the Confederate flag. Does he believe NASCAR should fly the Confederate flag? And why don’t they fly it here?
MS. MCENANY: The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that, in fact, was not a hate crime. At the very end, the ban on the flag was mentioned in the broader context of the fact that he rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women who go to these sporting events are racist when, in fact, as it turns out, what we saw with the FBI report and the alleged incident of a hate crime — it was a complete indictment of the media’s rush to judgment once again, calling this a hate crime when the FBI completely dismissed that.
Q Let me ask you about some of the President’s comments this weekend. The President said that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless. Which members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force agree with that statement?
MS. MCENANY: So what the President was pointing to — and I’m glad you brought it up — was a factual statement, one that is rooted in science and one that was pointing out the fact that mortality in this country is very low. And I have two charts that we’ll pull up to illustrate that.
The first chart is the case fatality rate in the United States. And as you can see, the mortality rate has gone like this — (motions downward) — the case fatality rate. And also, in the second chart you’ll see — hopefully they have it up behind me — but the case rate — fatality rate in this country vis-à-vis other European countries is much lower than, let’s say, France and Italy. And what that speaks to is the great work of this administration with therapeutics and remdesivir and dexamethasone. And that’s what the President was pointing out.
Q So I want to get back to —
MS. MCENANY: Jon.
Q — just to follow up quickly, though. So if you don’t die, is it not harmless?
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this. Of course, he takes this very seriously. Of course, no one wants to see anyone in this country contract COVID, which is why the administration has fought hard to make sure that’s not the case with our historic response effort.
Jon.
Q Kayleigh, to follow on Peter’s question, what is the President’s position? Does he think NASCAR made a mistake by banning the Confederate flag?
MS. MCENANY: So he said he — I spoke to him this morning about this, and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of NASCAR and the fans and those who have gone, and this rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when, in fact, the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act. And it very much mirrors other times when there have been a rush to judgment, let’s say with the Covington boys or with Jussie Smollett.
Q But let’s drill down on the Confederate flag. Does he think it was a mistake for NASCAR to ban it?
MS. MCENANY: The President said he wasn’t making a judgment one way or the other. You’re focusing on —
Q But what is his position on it?
MS. MCENANY: — one word at the very bottom of a tweet that’s completely taken out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment on this.
Q Wasn’t he saying that NASCAR’s rating were down because they banned the flag? That’s what he said.
MS. MCENANY: The President was noting the fact that, in aggregate, this notion that NASCAR men and women who have gone and who are being demeaned and called racist, and being accused in some venues of committing a hate crime against an individual, those allegations were just dead wrong.
Q Does he think —
MS. MCENANY: Paula.
Q Does he think his supporters should not take the flag to Trump rallies? Has he considered banning the Confederate flag from Trump rallies?
MS. MCENANY: Well, at Trump rallies, all flags that are not official campaign gear are banned.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why is it Bubba Wallace’s responsibility to apologize for an investigation into a noose that he didn’t report and he never even saw? It was NASCAR that found this, that reported this. And even the FBI referred to it as a noose, even if they said it wasn’t a specific crime against Mr. Wallace. Why is the President even suggesting that Mr. Wallace should apologize?
MS. MCENANY: Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime, and he believes it’d go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well —
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: This was not —
Q He has.
MS. MCENANY: — a hate crime, as noted —
Q In interviews, he’s been very clear that —
MS. MCENANY: — by the FBI. So, the President —
Q — the FBI found this was not intentional.
MS. MCENANY: One of the things —
Q Why is he directing this at Mr. Wallace?
MS. MCENANY: So one of the things that —
Q He was a victim of a suspected hate crime.
MS. MCENANY: One of — this is where the President comes from, and this is where the President stands, and he actually hinted at this in his July 4th speech: “To those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racist, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity, we want a clear and faithful defense of American history and unity. And when you level false charges, you not only slander me, you slander the American people.” He believes —
Q Who was charged? It was an open investigation, Kayleigh —
MS. MCENANY: — the American people are good. And the allegations —
Q — into a noose. The FBI said —
MS. MCENANY: — and the rush to judgement —
Q — it was a noose.
MS. MCENANY: — with Jussie Smollett and the Bubba Wallace case and with the Covington Catholic boys, we shouldn’t be so quick to jump onto those narratives. Those are just three examples of those —
Q But you’re suggesting that Mr. Wallace —
MS. MCENANY: that have been proven false.
Yes.
Q — should apologize for an investigation that someone else initiated, suggesting he was possibly the victim of a hate crime?
MS. MCENANY: (Calls on next reporter.) Yes.
Q The Governor of South Dakota flew back on Air Force One after having contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus. Why was that allowed to happen? Did she have contact with the President on the trip back? And has the President continued to test negative since that interaction?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, the President is tested constantly, has tested negative, and those around him are tested as well.
Q But why — the original question is: Why was she to allowed to fly back on Air Force One with the President, when it was known that she had had contact with somebody who had tested positive for the virus?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I’d have to refer you to Secret Service on that. But I’ll tell you this: They take the President’s health very seriously. They would never put him in a situation that would put him in harm’s way.
Q And just one follow-up, please.
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q On executive orders, the President has set a pretty brisk pace on those this year. And as a candidate, he had been critical of President Obama’s use of executive orders, but he seems to have really stepped up the pace on these. And I wanted to ask, you know, what does he find — what is the strategy behind issuing more than one a week so far this year? And I know he’s getting ready to issue more in the coming weeks.
MS. MCENANY: Well, he will use the powers in his executive toolkit to further the agenda of the American people. That’s his intent with these executive orders. And I would just note that, with regard to the DACA decision, the Supreme Court has suggested he has pretty wide discretion to act.
Yes, Jeff.
Q Hi, Kayleigh. With regard to the President’s reference about the 99 percent being harmless, does the President worry at all that by downplaying the severity of the virus, that it will lead Americans to be less careful?
MS. MCENANY: The President isn’t downplaying the severity of the virus. What the President is noting is that, at the height of this pandemic, we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where, on July 4th, there were 254; that’s a tenfold decrease in mortality. On July 5th, 209 individuals, down 23 percent from last Sunday and the lowest Sunday since March 28th.
The President has made clear: We grieve when just one life is lost, but he wants to note the progress that we’ve made in treating this very serious virus when we have therapeutics like convalescent plasma, remdesivir, dexamethasone. Convalescent plasma, in particular, was spearheaded by this administration.
He’s used — he’s pulled down bureaucracy and allowed us to get to a place where we can have this declining mortality rate.
Q And just to follow up on the NASCAR thing: You were saying that we’re taking the tweet out of context, but this is what he tweeted. He says, “Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!”
How — how are we misinterpreting that?
MS. MCENANY: I’ve explained to you — this is, I guess, the fourth attempt, but we’ll try it again — in aggregate, what he was pointing out is this rush to judgment to immediately say that there is a hate crime, as happened in this case, as happened with Jussie Smollett, as happened with the Covington Catholic boys. In an aggregate, those actions made it seem like NASCAR men and women were racist individuals who were roving around and engaging in a hate crime.
The President’s intent was to say, no, most American people are good, hardworking people, and we should not have this rush to judgment, kneejerk reaction before the facts come out. The FBI did their job and determined there was no hate crime.
Mario.
Q Is the President comparing Smollett to Wallace?
Q Hold on. Hold on. Just that one thing it wasn’t clear in your response — and that’s why I asked about it again, and it follows up on Paula’s question — is: Why should Mr. Wallace have to apologize for that when his whole team and all of these colleagues came around him to show support?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, and that’s the best of America, is coming around when the media alleged a hate crime; coming around and supporting Bubba Wallace as they should have done. I think that shows how loving NASCAR fans are and the fellow drivers.
But I think it’s important that we point out the fact that there was no hate crime; the FBI concluded that. And President Trump was merely saying that Mr. Wallace should agree with that consensus.
Yes, Mario.
Q No, he’s saying he has to apologize.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q He’s saying he has to apologize. That’s what we’re trying to ask you, Kayleigh, is —
MS. MCENANY: Mario, yes.
Q — why should he have to apologize about that?
MS. MCENANY: I’m not going to answer a question a sixth time.
Mario.
Q But you haven’t answered that question. I mean, you’ve been asked it, but you haven’t answered it.
Q You haven’t answered it.
MS. MCENANY: Mario, go ahead.
Q Kayleigh, on the Confederate part: Why would the President not praise NASCAR for removing the Confederate flag, particularly given the history of that flag, the symbol that it has for African Americans, and also what it represents in terms of just the treasonous acts and the insurrection against the Republic?
MS. MCENANY: So —
Q Why would he not praise them for taking that down, even if it’s a ratings (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: The President takes great offense when Americans — our kneejerk reaction summed up as racist. And in aggregate, the picture being painted here in this instant — incident seemed to be that there was that suggestion there, when, in fact, what we’re seeing across the nation is this vast cancel culture where we’re going to tear down our monuments, we’re going to tear down Gandhi, we’re going to tear down George Washington, we’re going to tear down Lincoln.
It’s really quite appalling what we’ve seen happen across the country, and the President wants no part in cancel culture. He wants to no part in the tearing down and defacing of Matthias Baldwin, an abolitionist; Philadelphia Civil War soldiers; John Greenleaf Whittier vandalized, an abolitionist. He wants no part in this, and he stands against the demonization of Americans, and he stands firmly on the side of preserving our history.
Yes.
Q But, Kayleigh, the Confederate flag is a different issue.
MS. MCENANY: He’s not — I said from the very top of this briefing: He has not given an opinion one way or the other on that. I just spoke to him this morning.
Yes.
Q Kayleigh, why — what exactly does the President see as positive or uniting then about the Confederate flag? Why does he — why did he decide to tweet about it then, this morning?
MS. MCENANY: The President never used those words. Those are the words of a reporter, not that of the President of the United States.
Q And, Kayleigh, to follow up —
MS. MCENANY: Yes, Phil.
Q Thank you. The President argued on Friday, and then again on Saturday, that many of the problems the country faces stem from, quote, “extreme indoctrination and bias” in the education system. If that’s the case, is he working with Secretary DeVos to address what he sees as a major problem?
You know, what — what steps is he taking to (inaudible) this? And could you give us an example?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I’d have to inquire about that, about specific steps that he’s taken. I’m not aware of his conversations with Secretary DeVos, but I will certainly follow up.
But, look, we’ve got a real problem in this country. When you have rioters who — I have listed off some of the examples of abolitionists — there seems to be zero understanding of history when you’re defacing the statue of Matthias Baldwin and John Whittier and Ulysses S. Grant.
There seems to be a lack of understanding and historical knowledge when the Armenian Genocide Memorial, remembering victims of all crimes against humanity including slavery, is vandalized.
There seems to be a lack of understanding of history when the first responders sculpture is damaged, when the Polish war hero statue, the World War I Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and absolutely the Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment Washington [Massachusetts] Memorial that honored African American soldiers who fought valiantly in the Civil War was damaged in Boston. We need to have a better historical understanding.
And I’ll follow up with you about specific conversations.
Yes, Toluse.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I have question about masks. The President has, sort of, equivocated on the issue of masks, and we know that a number of Republicans are starting to say that it’s the single-most important thing that Americans can do to protect each other. What is the President’s message to Americans who hear those messages and say that they simply don’t want to wear a mask? What does the President say to those (inaudible)?
MS. MCENANY: Well, the President was very clear last week that if he were in a situation where he wasn’t tested daily and he was in close proximity and unable to social distance, that he would wear a mask. So he has made that clear. At his rally this weekend in New Hampshire, masks are not only handed out but they are recommended.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. I wanted to say, first off, point of fact: Bubba Wallace did not make any kind of false report. And I’m wondering, in general, why the President thinks that issue is worth his time and focus right now in the midst of a deadly pandemic? And then also, you’ve said he has no opinion on the Confederate flag. Why can’t this White House unambiguously state whether or not it supports displays of the Confederate flag and —
MS. MCENANY: No, I said —
Q — Confederate monuments, which are much more —
MS. MCENANY: I said in his —
Q — a part of this question than Gandhi?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I said that, you know, he was — his tweet was not to indicate approval or disapproval of that particular policy of NASCAR. It was in aggregate to stand against the rush to judgment to call something a hate crime before the facts were out, when clearly the media was wrong about this, when clearly —
Q But you said Bubba Wallace made a false report; he didn’t.
MS. MCENANY: I never said that. Perhaps one of the reporters said that, but I certainly did not.
But he believes that we should be — that the truth matters and that the truth was: The FBI did a thorough investigation, and what was concluded — that there was no hate crime here. And we should all be grateful for that; grateful that NASCAR fans came together in a great display of American unity around Mr. Wallace. But then we should also be equally unequivocal about the truth of this situation here and that most Americans are great, hardworking people.
Yes.
Q But why is this cultural stuff worth his time and —
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q — focus during the pandemic?
MS. MCENANY: Yes, he’s focused on two things at once, something we’re all capable of doing.
Q And what about on an unambiguous statement on the Confederate flag? Are we capable of doing that?
MS. MCENANY: Look, the President has made clear he was not taking a position one way or the other in that tweet.
Q Exactly. But why not?
MS. MCENANY: Yes. Yes.
Q Thanks, Kayleigh. Two quick questions, if I may. Does the President support the Cleveland Indians and the football team here in Washington considering changing their names?
MS. MCENANY: I haven’t spoken to the President on that.
Q And the other question: Who came up with the list of historical figures that the President wants honored in his — in his garden of statues that he put out this executive order about? Who came up with the list of people to be included?
MS. MCENANY: So, I don’t know exactly who came up with that list. I can ask about it, but it’s a pretty extraordinary list of people. I think we can all agree on the fact that great American heroes are people like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Jr. — these are incredible men and women in our history — Susan B. Anthony and Billy Graham. So I think we can all pretty much widely acknowledge that these are American heroes.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh. The President signed the Payroll Protection Program extension over the weekend. There’s $132 billion in the pot. What does the President think that that money should be used for if it’s still there after August 8th? And then, in a CARES 4, specifically, what should be there to help small businesses?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don’t have any updates on phase four. I’ve mentioned that the payroll tax is something of great interest to the President because it would help low — low- and middle-income Americans most. PPP funding — they’ve done an extraordinary job with that. Small businesses across the country have gotten this, and we’ve kept people on payroll. So he’s very pleased with the progress that’s been made there and the continuing functioning of the PPP.
Yes.
Q Would he veto a bill then that did not have the payroll tax relief in it?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, I don’t want to set parameters or conditions. That’ll be up to the President when the bill arrives on his desk.
Yes.
Q Thank you, Kayleigh, so much. As President Trump wants to reopen the country, what will be the criteria to cancel the travel bans? Because we know that the bans are still in place for European countries where the situation is under control. And, on the other hand, there is no ban on hotspots like Russia, India, or Mexico, for example. So what is the criteria?
MS. MCENANY: Yeah, so I don’t have specific criteria to give you. I’d have to refer you to the State Department and Secretary Pompeo, and his remarks on the topic during his last press conference, as where we currently stand.
But President Trump and the administration have taken bold, decisive, and frequent action to secure our homeland, and a big part of that has been these travel restrictions. And we’re working with countries around the world, and we hope to have a day where international travel is open. But right now, this is about putting America first.
And I want to say this —
Q Kayleigh, can I ask one more question?
MS. MCENANY: Yes.
Q European countries, and now the UK, are starting to open for touring visitors, but the U.S is still banned. How do you think the world is looking at the United States right now?
MS. MCENANY: I think the world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19, because the chart I showed you, where you have mortality rate — and Italy and UK up here and across Europe, and you have the United States at a low case mortality rate — it’s because of the extraordinary work that we’ve done on therapeutics and getting PPE and leading on ventilators and having excess ventilators that we were able to deploy around the world and help other countries. So that’s what I would have to say on COVID.
And finally, I’d end with this: You know, I was asked probably 12 questions about the Confederate flag. This President is focused on action, and I’m a little dismayed that I didn’t receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend. I didn’t receive one question about New York City shootings doubling for the third straight week. And over the last seven days, shootings skyrocketed by 142 percent. Not one question. I didn’t receive one question about five children who were killed.
And I’ll leave you with this remark by a dad — it broke my heart — a dad of an eight-year-old lost in Atlanta this weekend: “They say black lives matter…you killed a child. She didn’t do nothing to nobody,” was his quote.
We need to be focused on securing our streets, making sure no lives are lost because all black lives matter — that of David Dorn and that of this eight-year-old girl.
Thank you.END 1:51 P.M EDT"

The history of hate: The New Mexico Holocaust Museum's new exhibit
The New Mexico Holocaust Museum and Gellert Center for Education (616 Central Ave. SW, Albuquerque) reopened to the public with two new featured exhibits. Overturned: A Life Etched in Stone follows a woman's journey through her family's history, which is entangled in the Nazis' efforts to persecute and eliminate Jewish German citizens. Hate in America describes hate crimes in the United States and outlines what it means to become an ""upstander,"" rather than a bystander.

Fascinating forgeries: Driven to Abstraction
For more than a century, Knoedler & Company sold fine art on New York City's ritzy East Side. Then, in 2011, the gallery quietly closed its doors. The gallery had sold tens of millions of dollars in faked art and had been caught in the act. Documentarian Daria Price explores how the gallery came into possession of so many forged works in the film Driven to Abstraction. Was this scandal a one-time anomaly? Or, does it reveal something more nefarious about the art world? Watch the film via the Center for Contemporary Art's Living Room Series and then tune back in for a conversation, The Big Fake, between Price and James Kelly, who owned the James Kelly Contemporary in Santa Fe.

WASHINGTON/MINAPOLIS, 8 jun (Reuters) - Pressure for major reforms to the police intensified Monday in the United States after two weeks of protests over the death of George Floyd, as the white agent accused of killing him was preparing for his first appearance in court.
The anger of the protesters over the death on May 25 of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, is making its way to a growing determination to turn his case into a turning point in race relations and a milestone in changing the criminal justice system.
Floyd died after Agent Derek Chauvin pressed a knee over his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis. A passerby captured the scene with his cell phone, while Floyd told the agent he couldn't breathe.
Chauvin, who will appear in a Minneapolis court on Monday, is charged with second- and third-degree murder, as well as reckless second-degree murder.
Three other officers involved in the incident were charged with assisting and being complicit in second-degree murder and reckless second-degree murder. All four officers were expelled from the corps.
Thousands of people are expected to attend an event in memory of Floyd on Monday. The likely Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, plans to meet later in the day with Floyd's family, according to his advisers.
Floyd, who grew up in Houston, will be buried on Tuesday. The elegy is expected to be delivered by the Reverend Al Sharpton, a historic black civil rights leader.
Although there was violence at some points, the protests have been generally peaceful in recent days and have deepened President Donald Trump's political crisis, which repeatedly threatened to order the deployment of soldiers on the streets.
Over the weekend, large crowds gathered across the country and in Europe. The lively atmosphere was cracked on Sunday night, when a man threw a car at a protest in Seattle and then shot and wounded a protester who struck him.
Democrats presented legislation in Congress Monday that would turn lynching into a hate crime and allow victims of irregular conduct and their families to sue police for damage in civil courts, ending a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity.
Legislation is also expected to prohibit police bottlenecks and racial bias, national use of body cameras, as well as the submission of police to civilian review boards, according to congressional sources.
In Minneapolis, most members of the city council pledged to abolish the police department in favor of a model of community security, a decision that would have been unthinkable before Floyd's death.

In this world, where Black trans women are abused, beaten, and murdered for existing, where anti-queer hate crimes are on the rise, where it is now legal to deny people health care simply because they are trans, pride is more important than ever.
It does not matter that employers can no longer fire employees for being queer if they can fire them for no reason at all.
It does not matter that hate crimes are illegal when they are vastly underreported by federal crime statistics and individuals for fear of future retribution from the communities they live in.
Queer folk are coming out more and more as acceptance grows. In a 2017 study, it was found that 20 percent of people aged 18-34 identify as queer.
A common explanation for this phenomenon is so called ""social contagion,"" that is, the idea that people are labeling themselves queer to be the new cool, hip thing based on a few poorly-sourced studies.
This idea and these studies are flawed in a grotesque way. They will survey online web forums populated by parents and survey the parents on their ideas as opposed to the children themselves. Such studies will be updated and republished with their conclusions radically altered to accurately reflect the data according to leading researchers.
But as usual, bigotry does not falter in the face of data. Noted national news outlet The Federalist has a vast number of articles talking about the ways in which ""transgenderism"" is a fad, how ""the transgender push mirrors the lobotomy craze,"" and other abhorrent, illegitimate ideas.
And I am not saying this simply because it is ""offensive,"" or ""rude,"" or ""not politically correct"" to express these ideas.
These ideas are wrong: ethically, morally, and scientifically.
Every notable and well-respected medical organization recognizes the validity of transgender youth and adults: the American Psychological Association, the Human Rights Campaign, and even the United Nations.
If these people wanted to help others, they would accept the scientifically verified fact that transitioning from a young age helps transgender youth and saves lives.
But this is the new, modern veneer of bigotry. It is with rare exception that discriminatory actions are publicly flaunted - it is done in by masking bigotry in unoffensive language.
Bathroom bills are pushed not to discriminate against trans people, but to ""protect women"" (notice there the inherent idea that trans women are not, in fact, women), despite the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that proves that is what the bills do. They are meant to embarrass and humiliate trans people in public and scare them out of presenting as who they are in public.
New York has what is known as a ""walking while trans"" ban, which allowed police to harass and arrest individuals whose dress might indicate them to be sex workers.
Unsurprisingly, this targeted trans women more than any other group, and especially Black trans women.
Because at its core, pride is not a celebration for just ""being different."" It's not about ""being unique"" or ""standing out."" It's a rallying cry, saying ""We are here. We will not go away. We exist, and we will continue to fight for ourselves.""
It took me until I was 19 to realize I was trans because I was never exposed to the idea of even being trans. Because when I found out what being trans was, I was told it was bizarre and obscure and weird. Because when I learned more about what being trans meant, I was afraid to admit it because of all the struggles trans people face.
But Pride helps everyone out there struggling know that they belong. That no matter what they're facing, there are other people like them. That even when the Pride flags are tucked away and the parades stop, those people are still alive and fighting.
That I am not the first, and I will not be the last person to take pride in the fact that I am who I am and living."

Why? Why is daddy gone? Looking through your eyes, we should also be asking ourselves why the answer is so often to cruel and painful. Why in this nation due to many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life? George Floyd's final journey was by horse-drawn carriage, with people lining the streets, his coffin was taken to a cemetery south of Houston, where he was laid to rest next to his mother, for whom he cried out as he lay dying. A private ceremony, after a very public farewell. Many of the largest protests of the past few weeks have been in Washington, DC, much of it around the White House. Muriel Bowser is the Mayor of Washington, DC. She told us why she thinks the funeral is a turning point.

The Governor of New York has poured scorn on President Trump's tweeting of an unfounded conspiracy theory about a protestor injured by police in the city of Buffalo last week. Mr Trump questioned the incident, suggesting that the elderly protestor was an anti-fascist provocateur who faked his fall, even though the video clearly showed him being pushed by police.

This short essay collection includes Smith's recent thoughts on the coronavirus pandemic, race relations in America and other subjects.
FULL TEXT
Wunderkinds, even those who deservedly stick around a long time, don't seem to age normally. Zadie Smith's presence will always carry a significant memory of the 24-year-old who published ""White Teeth"" to international acclaim. But, being subject to the space-time continuum, Smith is in her mid-40s now, and has the temperament and perspective of someone who could be (a compliment, in this case) 105.
It's never a boom time for wisdom - almost by definition; if it were more common, it wouldn't be valued so highly - but this is an especially arid era for it. We're in the Age of Certainty, at least in the bellowing of its various constituents. And maybe that's fine; maybe some times are just for fighting ideological fire with ideological fire. But ""polemic"" is too generous a word for the dominant cultural tone.
All of which makes Smith feel especially out of time. In the very brief foreword to her first book of essays, ""Changing My Mind,"" she wrote: ""Ideological inconsistency is, for me, practically an article of faith."" That faith doesn't seem to have wavered in the 10 years since that book was published. ""Intimations,"" her slender new collection (less than 100 pages) of ultra-timely essays (several written in the past few momentous months), showcases her trademark levelheadedness.
This cast of mind doesn't mean that Smith avoids moral stances. In ""Intimations,"" she speaks clearly and forcefully about the murder of George Floyd and the legacy of slavery and the systemic sins revealed by Covid-19. ""The virus map of the New York boroughs turns redder along precisely the same lines as it would if the relative shade of crimson counted not infection and death but income brackets and middle-school ratings,"" she writes. ""Death comes to all - but in America it has long been considered reasonable to offer the best chance of delay to the highest bidder.""
At her most withering, on the subject of race, she writes about the many, ""even in the bluest states in America,"" who ""are very happy to 'blackout' their social media for a day, to read all-Black books and 'educate' themselves about Black issues - as long as this education does not occur in the form of actual Black children attending their actual schools.""
But despite these jabs, Smith remains unmistakably noncombative. This spirit appears born not of a fear of confrontation but a genuine perplexity (of a searching, brilliant kind) at the nature of experience and people, including herself. She says that the art of writing, though it's often advertised as ""creative,"" is really about ""control."" ""The part of the university in which I teach,"" she says, ""should properly be called the Controlling Experience Department.""
As a writer and reader, what she finds - in a phrase perfectly suited to her sensibility - is ""a wide repertoire of possible attitudes."" But out in the world, living eludes control; it's ""mystifying, overwhelming, conscious, subconscious,"" and ""it just keeps coming at you.""
Smith's gifts as a novelist animate her essays. Writing about the neighborhood nail place where she regularly goes for stress relief, we get a portrait of her masseur, Ben, who teases her for always reading during their sessions and who asks where her hair ""comes from."" (""Jamaica and England - via Africa,"" she tells him. Ben replies: ""Ho ho ho! Interesting mix!"") As the essay closes, Smith watches Ben from afar, the optimistic face she's used to seeing changed into ""a stern portrait of calculation and concern,"" worried, Smith assumes, about the constant heavy traffic needed for the place to pay the rent.
Anxiety lurks through these few pages. This is a work of minor dimensions at - and about - a major time. (Royalties from the book will go to two charities, The Equal Justice Initiative and The COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund for New York.)
Smith herself left New York early on in the pandemic's course, and she expresses guilt about this without over-performing it. She bemoans, when thinking about the apocalypse or anything even approaching it, her lack of a survival instinct. ""A book like 'The Road' is as incomprehensible to me as a Norse myth cycle in the original language,"" she writes. ""Suicide would hold out its quiet hand to me on the first day - the first hour.""
In an essay called ""Suffering Like Mel Gibson"" (its title is a play on a popular meme), she writes provocatively of Christ on the cross, looking at those crucified beside him and wondering ""whether his agonies, when all was said and done, were relatively speaking in fact better than those of the thieves and beggars to his left and right whose sufferings long predated their present crucifixions and who had no hope (unlike Christ) of an improved post-cross situation."" This thought comes in a passage addressing the word of this century so far, ""privilege,"" which she does with her usual many-sidedness: She notes her own advantages; parses the stubbornness of inequality; and outlines the explanatory (and experiential) limitations of privilege, including its ultimate inability to shield anyone from suffering, sometimes to the point of suicide. In Zadie Smith's universe - meaning, for my money, the one we're all living in - complexity is king.
She sympathizes with the generations coming up behind her, born into a beleaguered century and now living through the current crises with worried eyes on a deeply tenuous future. In one of the finest lines in ""Intimations,"" Smith writes: ""The infinite promise of American youth - a promise elaborately articulated by movies and advertisements and university prospectuses - has been an empty lie for so long that I notice my students joking about it with a black humor more appropriate to old men, to the veterans of wars.""
It might be engrossing to hear Smith in conversation with those she now teaches, to see where their ideas overlap and diverge. Toward the end of the book, she writes elliptically of identity as an ""area of interest."" Elsewhere she argues for solidarity among ""the plague class - that is, all economically exploited people, whatever their race.""
Interested in what she once called ""coalition across difference,"" Smith has some opinions that she defines as commonplace but that she must know are now hotly debated.
She resists, for instance, the idea of ""hate crime"" as a desirable distinction, calling it ""an elevation of importance in what strikes me as the wrong direction,"" lending an undeserved power to the bigotry that inspires the term.
""The hatred of a group qua group is, after all, the most debased and irrational of hatreds, the weakest, the most banal,"" she writes. ""It shouldn't radiate a special aura, lifting it into a separate epistemological category. For this is exactly what the killer believes.""

Our North America correspondent Peter Bowes reports. A final goodbye to a man whose death sparked protests around the world, a black man loved by his family, killed by the police, whose death may have changed the world. George Floyd was a regular guy from a rough neighbourhood, a father, a champion basketball and football player, a gentle man. His funeral was passionate, political, but above all personal.

Why in this nation due to many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life?

Joe Negrelli, a lifelong New Yorker, was at the Stonewall Inn the hot and humid June night 51 years ago when LGBTQ patrons rioted against a police raid, launching the modern gay rights movement.A year later, he marched with hundreds of others from Greenwich Village to Central park to commemorate the uprising. That event marked the world's first Pride parade, which turns 50 today.""There's a tremendous lack of understanding of how far the LGBTQ movement has come,"" Negrelli, who was 18 back then and is now 68, told Business Insider.Since then, Negrelli has kept careful tabs on all the milestones America's queer community has reached, both the good and the bad.""If you had told me decades ago that the gay liberation movement would get to this point, where we'd go from being arrested, evicted, fired from our jobs for being gay to now the Supreme Court ruling we can't be discriminated against at work, I wouldn't believe you!
 I can't believe it's happened during my lifetime,"" said Negrelli, who is a member of the SAGE USA[2], an advocacy group for LGBTQ elders.This year, Pride parades across the country, including New York City's, have been canceled due to the coronavirus. But that doesn't mean people aren't celebrating: Many are tuning into online events, like yesterday's virtual Global Pride[3] on June 27.Read below for a visual tour of the setbacks and victories America's LGBTQ community has seen in the years since the very first march, and click here[4] to read more about Negrelli's experiences as a gay man before the Stonewall riots. June 28, 1969: Patrons of the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street in New York City resisted arrest. Word spread quickly through the area, and more people joined to protest. According to Negrelli, the uprising began when a police officer flung slurs against someone who identified as transgender. The officer pulled off her wig, and the patron punched him.Trans-rights advocates and self-identified drag queen Marsha P. Johnson was at the Inn the night of the riot. Along with friend and drag queen Sylvia Rivera, she would create the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens and LGBTQ youth. June 28, 1970: On the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, thousands of members of the LGBTQ movement marched through New York from Christopher Street into Central Park on what would become America's first gay-pride parade. Though other commemorations were held around the country, New York's is widely credited[5] as the first Gay Pride march.""We have to come out into the open and stop being ashamed, or else people will go on treating us as freaks,"" one member of the group the Gay Liberation Front told the New York Times.Sources: NBC News[6] and The New York Times[7] December 15, 1973: The board of the American Psychiatric Association voted to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses.

That year's National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights became known as ""The Great March"" for its large turnout, which activists estimated to be more than 500,000 people.The goal was to get more federal funding to address the AIDS epidemic, which at its height in the mid-1980s killed 150,000 per year, most of them LGBTQ people. The federal government began funding more national, regional, and community-based programs a year after the march.Sources: PBS[11], CDC.gov[12],One Archives[13] August 18, 1990: The Ryan White Care Act was passed, which created the federal government's largest program providing services for people living with HIV/AIDS.

Our North America correspondent Peter Bowes reports. A final goodbye to a man whose death sparked protests around the world, a black man loved by his family, killed by the police, whose death may have changed the world. George Floyd was a regular guy from a rough neighbourhood, a father, a champion basketball and football player, a gentle man. His funeral was passionate, political, but above all personal. 
I just want to say, I love you, and I think God for giving me my own personal Superman. Amongst the tears and the family's grief, there was anger, reflecting the outrage seen on the streets over the past two weeks. No more hate crimes, please. Someone said make America great again, but one has America ever been great? I want justice for my brother, my big brother. That's big Floyd. Everybody know who big Floyd is now. He died lying on the Minneapolis Street, with the knee of a police officer bearing down on his neck. Some of the mourners war I can't breathe badgers, a reference to George Floyd's final words, gasping as his life slipped away -- wore. The Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, addressed the funeral in a recorded video message. No child you have to ask questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations. Why? Why is daddy gone? Looking through your eyes, we should also be asking ourselves why the answer is so often to cruel and painful. Why in this nation due to many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life? George Floyd's final journey was by horse-drawn carriage, with people lining the streets, his coffin was taken to a cemetery south of Houston, where he was laid to rest next to his mother, for whom he cried out as he lay dying. A private ceremony, after a very public farewell. Many of the largest protests of the past few weeks have been in Washington, DC, much of it around the White House. Muriel Bowser is the Mayor of Washington, DC. She told us why she thinks the funeral is a turning point. It definitely feels like a moment, and I especially see it in the young people who we have seen out in American cities in droves demanding change. They are a generation who is - who has experienced this police violence on camera. From bystander video, from dash cams, from body-worn cameras, in a way that even people of my generation, X, haven't. So I think that they are going to keep pushing for national change, for local change, and use their voices at the ballot box. The Governor of New York has poured scorn on President Trump's tweeting of an unfounded conspiracy theory about a protestor injured by police in the city of Buffalo last week. Mr Trump questioned the incident, suggesting that the elderly protestor was an anti-fascist provocateur who faked his fall, even though the video clearly showed him being pushed by police. This is how New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reacted. What, do you think it was - it was staged? You think the blood coming out of his head was staged?! Is that what you're saying? You saw his head hit the pavement! You see blood on the pavement. ""Maybe he fell harder than he was pushed."" How reckless, how irresponsible, how mean, how crude! I mean, if there was ever a reprehensible, dumb comment - and from the President of the United States. Let's speak now to our North America correspondent Peter Bowes. Clearly a very angry governor of New York. Just remind us of this incident, and what happened to this man and exactly what Mr Trump said in his suite. Yes, this was a 75-year-old man, a well-known local activist, although his friends who have been responding to what has happened over the last 24 hours or so say that he is not a provocateur, he is a peaceful activist. And he was caught on video being pushed by the police, and the president in his suite accuses him of using some sort of device to"

From noon several capsules were transmitted informing about trans childhoods; recognition of diverse families; approval of rights; HIV prevention, detection and care; the problem of correcting sexual orientation; what about LGBT youth; the importance of social media; older adults in the community; hate crimes, among other issues. Singer Thalía was in charge of flagping the way out of making a broadcast from her home in New York. Also, the head of government of Mexico City, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo; The Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights of the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, Martha Delgado Peralta; and citizen movement senator Patricia Mercado gave a message to participants. ""Our commitment to continue to make progress in the legal, social and labour spheres in the various areas of LGBT+ rights, there will be no setback in the progress made for birth registration for lesbomaternal families and we will continue to make progress in recognizing the civil status of trans people and in general the recognition that families are diverse and must be fully respected in all provisions and norms of the civil registry. 
Congratulations to everyone and all of us, let's keep moving forward in our city of rights,"" Sheinbaum said. During the march, concerts were broadcast by artists such as Melanie C, of the Spice Girls, OV7, Lies, Mentidrags, Limbo Beach, among others.

An increasing number of independent observers have taken their criticism of the Bharatiya Janata party's (BJP) decision to proceed with the illegally annexation of the territory to the Social Media.
With the struggle for freedom from India's illegal occupation gaining momentum, the nationalist government in Delhi made a series of gaffes to control what become the biggest PR nightmare for the world's so-called largest democracy. One of them was controlling Kashmir's communication lines. Not only that, India is actively trying to change the social fabric of the Muslim-majority Himalayan region that it occupies illegally. The total blackout and the oppressive moves by Delhi since August 5 have only earned India and its leader scorn from all corners.
'Kashmir Muslims' fears are becoming a reality in the shape of thousands of Hindu non-Kashmiris being granted residency by the BJP government in Delhi which now runs JK since 5 Aug 2019. It's all about changing the demographics of the region,' cautioned Professor Claude Rakisits in a post on Twitter. 
The Canberra-based analyst on India, Pakistan, and Kashmir routinely takes to Twitter to criticize the Modi government's actions. In his most recent post on the micro blogging and social networking service, Professor Rakisits also urged Pakistan to build a collation of nations to support a referendum that allows the people of Kashmir to decide their future.
'Pakistan needs to sell its message-the need for a genuine, UN-supervised referendum for Kashmiris-on the international stage and build a coalition of nations to make it happen,' said Professor Rakisits, who has served as adviser to a deputy prime minister and a shadow minister for foreign affairs.
Another prominent name on Twitter, CJ Werleman also openly criticises the violations in Kashmir. In his latest article for the TRT world, the journalist said: 'Life for Kashmir's 8 million residents has become measurably worse in the past year.'
Werleman who also documents hate crimes against Muslims said: 'Pro-Indian government online trolls are creating fake social media accounts to paint a rosy picture of the Indian military occupation and aggression Kashmir.'
In his recent post on Twitter, Werleman said India, under Modi, has become a dangerous place for journalists and the center for hate crimes in the world. In another post, the Australian journalist said: 'The Indian government must immediately stop intimidation of journalists in Jammu and Kashmir. I know of two journalists who've been harassed by Indian Occupation Forces soon after appearing on my podcast.'
Outraged by the recent decision to advertising images of Hindu deity Ram and 3-D portraits of the temple to be constructed in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya in New York's Time Square, Werleman said: 'Hindutva fanatics in the US have paid for a billboard on New York City's Time Square to celebrate ethnic cleansing, specifically the erasure of an ancient mosque and Muslim graves in India.'
Ashok Swain, who serves as a Professor of Peace and Conflict Research at the Uppsala University in Sweden also routinely aims his guns at the Modi regime in New Delhi.
Like Werleman, Swain too, cautioned that Hindutva gangs had created several fake social media profiles to spread fake news about Kashmir. In a post last month, the Sweden-based professor said: 'Kashmir is being ruled by non-Kashmiris - Even colonial rulers used to keep some locals in the administration but not Modi.'
 'When you elect a joker, the country becomes a joke,' Swain quipped in one of his posts condemning Modi's actions. Referring to the recent murder of George Floyd in the US, that triggered a nation-wide protest against killings of African Americans, Swain said: 'India badly needs a similar type of mobilisation to oppose extra judicial killings of Muslims. Why not #Muslim_lives_Matter.'
For questioning Modi regime's policies in Kashmir openly on Twitter, Swain has also faced the wrath of Hindutva trolls. 'Modi's SS (Saffron Stupids) on the rampage - openly assaulting Kashmiris on the streets. Is there any rule of law in India still?' he said in a tweet last year that featured a video of a Kashmiri being assaulted.
Pieter Friedrich, who specializes in analysis of historical and current affairs in South Asia also joined the chorus on Twitter. A specialist in political ideologies and ethnonationalism, Friedrich mau led the Modi government for the occupation of Kashmir. 
 'Kashmir remains under extreme occupation,' he said in his latest post.
In another post he aimed his guns at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- a right-wing, Hindu nationalist, paramilitary volunteer organization that is very close to Prime Minister Modi.
'The RSS and its myriad affiliates, particularly #VHP and #BJP - are responsible for every major anti-minority pogrom in India since 1947. Their goal is to eliminate Christians/Muslims and assimilate Sikhs/Buddhists.'"

This month, SEARAC pays special homage to the intersectionalities of Pride Month, Immigrant Heritage Month, and the Black Lives Matter movement, along with Juneteenth on Friday and World Refugee Day on Saturday.
The origin of Pride is considered by many to have taken place on June 28, 1969, when patrons of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City, resisted and rioted against ongoing and violent police raids on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) community. With Black and Brown trans women like Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy leading the fight for the LGBTQ+ community's civil rights, these protests lasted for six days and invigorated a movement. A year later, the community gathered and marched to commemorate the Stonewall riots against police brutality, discrimination, and harassment, paving the way for Pride as we know it today.
""We celebrate with our LGBTQ+ community members in honoring these past five decades of progress, made possible through the courage and commitment of LGBTQ+ leaders, organizers, and activists, including many in the Southeast Asian American community,"" said Quyen Dinh, executive director of SEARAC. ""But the fight is not over. LGBTQ+ Americans still experience grave injustices, from health and employment discrimination and lack of access to proper healthcare, to police violence, hate crimes, and the denial of civil rights by the highest level of government. In our SEAA community's 45th anniversary year amidst a global pandemic, with a swell of urgency for our elected officials to dismantle systems of oppression and take action in defense of Black lives, we will continue to fight for human rights for all.""

224,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","The Guardian (London)",2020-11-09,"1222 words","OPINION; Version:1","Moustafa Bayoumi",NA,"With Trump voted out, can I finally feel at home in America again?",FALSE,"I became a citizen of the United States more than nine years ago, but in my heart I remain an immigrant. What I mean by this is something quite simple. I'm constantly aware of the gulf between my experiences as an immigrant and those of the native-born citizens around me.
Some of these differences are trivial, everyday matters, such as the fact that I am still far more fluent in celsius than in fahrenheit (and, honestly, how can the weather possibly reach 100 degrees?). Others reflect differences in upbringing. I can't recite the Pledge of Allegiance from memory, for example. But the biggest difference is more profound. Unlike most of the native-born, to be an immigrant in this country is to keep one eye always trained on the exit, just in case you're forced by circumstance to make a dash for your life.
Discussions of the precarious existence of non-citizens are often reserved for the undocumented, for obvious reasons. I've never been undocumented, so I can't speak personally to that experience, but I've gone through the gamut of immigration authorizations while living in this country, from being an international student, to landing a work visa, to holding a green card, to becoming a citizen. And while it has ebbed and flowed over the years, that uneasy feeling just won't go away.
While still an international student, I was driving back to New York City with friends after attending my best friend's wedding in Lake Placid. On the way, we were stopped by US border patrol. Lake Placid is over 70 miles from the nearest border crossing, and yet the armed agents still demanded to see my passport and student visa, which were tucked safely away in my apartment. Who knows why they let me go. My English-language fluency? My New York state-issued driver's license? The fact that a native-born American in the car vouched for me? And this was long ago. I can only imagine how this same scene would have played out during the Trump administration.
I was in Manhattan during the September 11 terrorist attacks. I recall not just the endless horror of that event but also how the fallout from the attacks burned like wildfire through immigrant Muslim communities around the country. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq brought microscopic scrutiny by the FBI to Muslim communities. And every time I crossed a border or had to deal with the authorities, I would get extremely anxious and then worry even more that this same rising anxiety would be used as a cause for suspicion against me. I probably wasn't a lot of fun to travel with.
As horrible as those times were, and they were often very frightening indeed, they still don't compare to Muslim immigrant life in this country when Donald Trump rose to political prominence and then became president. While there was a period immediately following the September 11 attacks that was characterized by large-scale vigilante violence, the prevailing position of both George W Bush and the Obama administration was to contain the vigilantes by essentially co-opting their violence. In effect, this left the vigilantes out in the cold. During the Bush and Obama years, Muslim immigrants in the country felt targeted far more by the government and its specific policies - everything from the Bush administration's Special Registration program to Obama's Countering Violent Extremism - than by attacks by vengeful citizens.
What Donald Trump accomplished in becoming president was the unification of this country's rightwing vigilante movements with the awesome resources of the federal government
That changed with Trump, who ushered in dramatic rises to all kinds of hate crimes, including anti-Muslim hate crimes, with his political consolidation. What Donald Trump accomplished in becoming president was the unification of this country's rightwing vigilante movements with the awesome resources of the federal government. The result was that violence was coming at us from all sides.
Nor was this violence limited to Muslim immigrants. Trump's white supremacist government made it clear that every non-white person, every trans person, every Jewish person, every disabled person, and so many more were worthy not just of contempt (as per his rhetoric) but also outright physical assault. Hate crimes against individuals reached a 16-year peak in 2018, the last available date for the data. During the course of the Trump administration, which began with the Muslim ban and ended with the administration unable to reunite 545 immigrant children with their parents, the administration passed more than 400 executive orders, many draconian, related to immigration. It will take years to undo this damage.
Although it shouldn't, it still surprises me that we were governed by explicit white supremacists in the 21st century. The result was not just the Muslim ban, immigrant kids in cages, and the end of asylum, but an entire system of unspeakable cruelty along with a nearly transparent desire to legislate the end of basic human compassion. If Trump had won a second term, we would likely have had to confront the end of birthright citizenship, the elimination of Daca and Temporary Protected Status programs, zero persons admitted as refugees, and everything that Trump, Stephen Miller, and the rest of these unfunny racist clowns would have juggled in order to keep the country as white as possible for as long as possible. Mercifully, we've been spared the continuation of this nightmare.
Today, we must seize Joe Biden's affirming victory not just as a repudiation of Trump and what he stands for but, more importantly, as a moment of political regeneration. Trump, after all, was always the symptom rather than the disease, and the racist and anti-immigrant worldviews he represented won't magically disappear on 20 January 2021.
When people talk about the USA as a country of immigrants, they're usually referring to American history - though we must never forget the non-immigrant indigenous and enslaved populations of our history, either. Whether coming from Italy or Russia or Mexico, from small towns in Asia or the metropolises of Africa, in the 19th century or the 21st, immigrants have been key drivers of political and economic regeneration in this country.
But maybe it's better if we think of the idea of ""a country of immigrants"" not as something to remember from the past but as something we guarantee for the country's future. A truly immigrant-welcoming America is one where there's no need to be eyeing the exits for your own survival. An immigrant-welcoming America is a stronger America, a prosperous America, and a compassionate America.
And it could be Biden's America, but only if we want it to be, if we're willing to fight for it. This vision of the country is fundamentally what Biden has promised us during the campaign, and it's one we must hold him to with all the conviction we can muster. The opportunity is finally here. We've let the politicians get away with far too much over the years. Now it's time for all of us, immigrant and native-born, to get to work and make it happen.

228,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Impact News Service",2020-07-08,"1881 words",NA,NA,NA,"NYSBA’s Virtual Bar Center: A Vision Fulfilled",FALSE,"Albany, NY: New York State Bar Association has issued the following press release:
A year ago, I shared with the House of Delegates at Cooperstown a vision for how the New York State Bar Association could better meet the needs of our members while simultaneously strengthening its role as a leader in the legal profession.
I believed it imperative that we rebuild our technology and digital operations with a new foundation — a “Virtual Bar Center” — through which attorneys both across the street and around the world could be just a click away from accessing NYSBA’s many services and benefits.
In addition, NYSBA needed to reinvigorate its commitment to diversity, reimagine its communications strategy and intensify our engagement and advocacy on cutting edge public policy issues impacting the profession and public.
It was an ambitious agenda, but together we accomplished all of that in just one year’s time. Here is an overview of that achievement:
The New NYSBA: A Technological Powerhouse
For too long we relied on a website built in 1998 that hampered NYSBA’s ability to analyze data and communicate in real time with existing and potential new alike. We have not only overhauled that site, but also put in place new software and technology systems that better serve members’ needs and also optimize staff productivity.
Our robust digital presence has made CLE registration and product purchases more user friendly with a new online store and member database. We are moving content outside of paywalls, digitizing our archives and posting breaking legal news to our website and social media platforms.
No one could have foreseen the events of the past several months when we launched our technology initiatives, but their timing has served us well. Just a few weeks before COVID-19 struck, our Virtual Bar Center was completed. As a result, when we were forced to close the Bar Center at 1 Elk St. in Albany at 8:00 p.m on March 22, we were able to seamlessly move to a remote platform and continue to serve our membership without undue interruptions.
Our digital reformation also enabled NYSBA to hold its first-ever virtual House of Delegates meeting in April, at which 207 members — the highest number in the body’s history — expressed their views and engaged in robust debate without a hitch. Following this success, bar associations around the country have reached out for our guidance on how to make the transition to virtual operations.
Simply put, NYSBA has become a nimble technological powerhouse. That capacity will be indispensable going forward, with the accelerating digitalization of the legal profession and society at large.
Leading on Diversity
This past year NYSBA has led by example on diversity. We took the unprecedented step of appointing diverse leaders to all 59 of NYSBA’s standing committees, while implementing an association-wide diversity and inclusion plan.
We repeatedly spoke out against intolerance, hate and unlawful acts directed at minorities and immigrants. During Annual Meeting, we held a summit that featured nationally respected speakers on the threat of white nationalism and domestic terrorism. And, in response to an alarming outbreak of hate crimes in New York, we assembled a blue-ribbon task force to study and make recommendations to combat this scourge.
The Commercial & Federal Litigation Section Task Force on Women’s Initiatives also updated its landmark 2017 study on women in the courtroom, as the House adopted its new report: “The Time is Now: Achieving Equality for Women Attorneys in the Courtroom and in ADR.”
NYSBA is walking the walk on diversity. But we also recognize there is more work to be done on this front, and we will continue these efforts into the future.
A New and Energized Communications Strategy
These accomplishments on modernization and diversity coincided with NYSBA’s implementation of a revamped communications strategy thanks to our Special Committee on Strategic Communications. It was established last June and is superbly led by past President David Miranda. Never before has NYSBA appeared in news reports as frequently, and in such a favorable light, as it does with regularity today.
Just in the past year, NYSBA has been mentioned in countless news articles. Its priorities have been highlighted in numerous op-eds and letters to the editor and delivered during radio commentaries and television interviews with regional and national media outlets, including CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NY1, Northeast Public Radio, Capital Tonight and The Capitol Pressroom.
NYSBA’s press releases contain real news because our groundbreaking initiatives impact both the legal community and society as a whole. Our website’s “News Center” provides timely and valuable daily content. No longer do members have to wait for print editions of the Journal and State Bar News to get the most up-to-date information that matters to them — both personally and professionally.
Thought Leader and Resource for Policymakers
Over the past year, NYSBA continued its commitment to reshaping the development of the law and protecting the citizenry’s rights. We formed six task forces to study and make recommendations to policymakers on substantive legal and public policy issues and four groups to address the challenges and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our task forces held public hearings and livestreamed meetings, allowing our members and the public to observe their deliberations and provide input.
The House of Delegates adopted comprehensive reports regarding the Uniform Bar Exam, the state’s rural justice crisis and the legal questions facing autonomous vehicles. The House also adopted a report from our Committee on Cannabis Law recommending the legalization of adult marijuana use in New York, and a report of the Task Force on Parole Reform that developed actionable solutions to the woefully high reincarceration rate of parolees in this state.
On behalf of all law students and future lawyers, we made a historic breakthrough in February, when our proposal to remove all mental health questions from the state bar application was approved by the Court of Appeals. NYSBA’s Working Group on Attorney Mental Health worked with extraordinary speed and skill and its report was a blueprint for real and lasting change.
In a similar vein, an innovative task force on the decline of local journalism produced an important report, and our Health Law Section addressed numerous issues related to COVID-19 in a thoughtful and scholarly manner.
NYSBA also led the charge at the American Bar Association’s (ABA) mid-year meeting in Austin, Texas for the adoption of a resolution to explore ways to expand access to justice, and again at the ABA’s Annual Meeting in San Francisco for the adoption of a resolution encouraging online providers of legal documents to adopt the ABA Best Practice Guidelines for Online Legal Document Providers.
Response to COVID-19
COVID-19 upended our lives, and the legal profession was not immune to these significant changes. As a result, March through May was the most intense and challenging period of my year as NYSBA president.
During this period, association leaders and staff worked around the clock to help our members and the public. Rather than shut down, we stepped up. No bar association provided more services or engaged in more effective advocacy for the betterment of the profession and public. It was, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, NYSBA’s finest hour.
Indeed, we launched the following initiatives to address the challenges presented to lawyers by COVID-19:
Oversaw the transformation of NYSBA’s website, social media outlets, and other digital platforms to provide real-time information regarding COVID-19 through e-blasts, webinars, publications, and an online information center. Convened on an emergency basis the Task Force of the New York Bar Examination, which made recommendations regarding the administration of the examination during the crisis that were adopted by the Court of Appeals in less than 48 hours. Created an Emergency Task Force for Solo and Small Firm Practitioners impacted by the crisis. Partnered with the Office of Court Administration to support and coordinate a statewide pro bono network of lawyers to handle the expected surge in legal cases resulting from the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout. Established the COVID-19 Recovery Task Force to Oversee Statewide Pro Bono Network, which, through an innovative website, provides free legal assistance for persons whose unemployment insurance claims are denied and who requires assistance in certain Surrogate Court’s matters; and also established a working group to provide recommendations to help resolve landlord-tenant disputes. Established a Working Group on Re-Opening Law Firms, which produced guidance for law firms to consider and address before a return to bricks and mortar offices is possible.
NYSBA Global
We also broke new ground this past year through the launch of our global membership initiative. Our international presence was expanded by an increased focus on membership, global events and recognition of New York’s preeminent place in the worldwide legal profession and commercial marketplace. We introduced a quarterly global newsletter to international members and reached out to 109 bar associations outside the United States, entering into memorandums of understanding with our counterparts in Seoul, Korea; Tokyo, Japan; Bucharest, Romania; and elsewhere.
The Gala: An Unforgettable Evening
On the evening of Jan. 30, 2020, nearly 1,000 attorneys gathered under the breathtaking Blue Whale at the American Museum of Natural History. After a quarter-century hiatus, NYSBA revived its proud 118-year tradition of holding an annual Gala dinner.
We awarded the Gold Medal to U.S Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, making her the 10th member of the high court to receive our association’s highest honor. Justice Kagan and Professor John Q. Barrett, her law school classmate and a distinguished legal historian, conducted an engaging fireside chat. We also honored the judges of the New York Court of Appeals and heard a stirring address by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore. The National Anthem was sung by Christopher Jackson, an Emmy and Grammy award-winning songwriter and composer.
The Gala was a grand and memorable event. Our profession came together to honor the rule of law and pay tribute to those who perform distinguished service to the law and society. It was a testament to our storied past and a future pledge to our continuing commitment to do the public good.
It has been the highest honor of my professional life to serve as president of this great association. I have been blessed with extraordinary support from the officers, executive committee and House of Delegates. We are also fortunate to have a world-class staff that is laser focused on NYSBA’s mission and works tirelessly to implement it.
As we continue to navigate through unprecedented and challenging times, NYSBA’s future is bright. In the past, whenever we met the challenges of the day, our association grew and prospered. We are once again securing our future for generations to come. We owe nothing less to our members, the legal profession and the public."

Debra Messing hosted first virtual ADL In Concert Against Hate, which recognized a Holocaust survivor, educators and a 4th grade activist who are fighting injustice
New York, December 7, 2020 ... ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) recognized two individuals and one group for their extraordinary courage and compassion when confronted with injustice and extremism as part of the 26th annual ADL In Concert Against Hate.
This year's event, which was held virtually on Dec. 6, was hosted by Debra Messing, and featured performances from an array of talent including Adam Levine, George Takei, Aloe Blacc, Ifetayo Ali-Landing, Olivia Boisson, Andra Day, Jason Isbell, Bebe Neuwirth, Kenny Loggins, Rafe Perlman, Grace Love and Bob Costas.
The concert included also special celebrity greetings from Lily Tomlin, Paul Shaffer, Lewis Black, Jason Alexander, Ronny Chieng, Scott Wolf, Peter Yarrow and Lizzy Caplan.
Actors, musicians, civil rights leaders, policymakers, and friends of ADL joined the free event to celebrate this year's honorees, each of whom has stood up to hate, injustice, and bias so that others will not have to experience the same. The individuals, who were presented with the ADL Kay Family Award, are:
Gerda Weissmann Klein
Born in Poland, Klein is a Holocaust survivor, author and human rights activist. As the founder of Citizenship Counts, she teaches about the privilege and responsibility of American citizenship and shares the healing power of optimism. In 2011, Klein received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Team Brownsville
After seeing the hardships of and indignities endured by asylum seekers just across the border from their hometown of Brownsville, Texas, these five educators were moved to act. Their team of volunteers provides humanitarian assistance and builds community across borders.
Bellen Woodard
As a 9-year-old living in Virginia, Woodard questioned why the ""skin-colored"" crayon meant ""peach."" Her More Than Peach Project fosters conversations that change perceptions and empower students.
""Hatred can seem unyielding and unending, but there are individuals in every community everywhere doing extraordinary things to fight back against bigotry,"" said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt. ""The individuals we recognized made a real difference, and they showed us that there is light in the darkness. Particularly in this time when we all face so many challenges, we need reminders that progress can be made and good can be done in the world. I'm grateful that we had this opportunity to share their stories and encourage others.""
This year's concert was brought to a global audience for the first time, and major events sponsored by ADL regional offices in several cities coincided with the national concert. Some highlights from those regional events include:
The ADL Southeast Regional Office in Atlanta honored Rep. Calvin Smyre, Dean of the Georgia House of Representatives, and his colleague, Rep. Chuck Efstration for their bipartisan efforts to pass hate crimes legislation. Katie Kirkpatrick, CEO of the Metro Atlanta Chamber, was also honored with the ADL Southeast Torch of Liberty Award. The local event also featured singer-songwriter and social activist Peter Yarrow.
ADL Midwest featured remarks from PJ Hill, Minneapolis community activist and former basketball player who organized multiple marches following the murder of George Floyd; Milwaukee Bucks President Peter Feigin, who spoke about why the Bucks players and organization led a playing boycott in support of racial justice; and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
The Philadelphia and Cleveland regional offices presented the Courage Award to Dr. Rachel Levine, the Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, who is transgender, at an event that also featured remarks from Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf.
The ADL Pacific Northwest Region featured remarks from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Gary Locke, Former Washington governor and former U.S. Commerce Secretary, and featured a keynote address by Eric Ward, Executive Director of the Western States Center.
ADL's Austin, Texas Regional Office honored Harvey M. Burg, a lifelong civil rights activist and founder of the first integrated law firm in Alabama with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The event also featured remarks from Tracy Frydberg, Senior Advisor to the Minister of Diaspora Affairs, State of Israel; the Hon. Rudolph ""Rudy"" Metayer, Pflugerville City Council Member and President of the Texas Black Caucus Foundation; and SaulPaul, GRAMMY-nominated Musician with a Message.
The Washington, D.C., regional event featured remarks from Alysa Cooper, granddaughter of this year's concert honoree, Gerda Weissmann Klein; and Debbie Levy, an award-winning author whose works have helped young people understand the fight for justice and hate in all forms.
ADL's Florida Region featured remarks from Jason Jenkins, Senior Vice President of the Miami Dolphins, a regional board member and ADL Aspen Institute Civil Society Fellow, along with Miami Dolphins players; and Ray Allen, NBA Hall of Famer and past ADL Torch of Liberty Award recipient.
ADL's Michigan Region featured remarks from Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, D-MI.
ADL's Heartland Region featured a video, ""We Got This,"" made by students participating in ADL's No Place for Hate program at The College School in St. Louis, MO.
ADL's New York/New Jersey Regional Office presented the 2020 Edward Brodsky Founders Award to Gregg L. Weiner, co-chair of ADL's NY/NJ Lawyers Division and a partner at Ropes and Gray LLP; and the 2020 Sidney Wilf Distinguished Young Leadership Award was presented to Benjamin M. Seigel, ADL NextGen Advisory Board Member and VP in Global Markets Engineering at Goldman Sachs.
The first ADL In Concert Against Hate was held in 1995 as a special event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust. The concert honored the memory of four individuals who are recognized as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" non-Jews who rescued Jews from the Nazis. Response to the concert was so overwhelming that what was supposed to be a one-time celebration was transformed into an annual tradition, which brings thousands together to be inspired by the stories of real heroes and to stand up against all forms of bigotry, injustice and extremism."

A number of my family members are in that small group.
Some of them just say it’s for financial reasons, that they believe in spending less and investing more — keeping government out of our hair and letting people make decisions to better themselves. That we’re at a $23 million deficit and they’re concerned about how China uses our interest payments. I’ve been told over family dinners that, “Young people want to change the world, but once you get older and tire of paying taxes, you’ll feel differently.”
This used to make a lot of sense to me — in fact, I used to be a Republican. In grade school, I mailed letters of admiration to my heroes: Ronald Reagan and Bill O’Reilly. In high school, when my government teacher asked us to stand on the left side of the room if we were Democrat and the right if we were Republican, I was the only person of color on the right. I remember both sides were confused by my choice. 
I thought Republicans were the richer, more powerful people in my home state of Indiana and I wanted to be on the side of the winners.
The first club I joined at my liberal arts college in rural Indiana: College Republicans. When I went over to their tent at the club fair to sign up, the white guy with the clipboard was wearing sunglasses and I couldn’t read his expression. He called over his two friends. “She wants to join our club.” They studied me. “Is this a joke?” one asked. “No,” I said, and took the clipboard to write down my email address. Afterwards, they all shook my hand and I felt like I was one step closer to my successful future. With that same hand, I proudly voted for McCain over Obama a couple of months later. 
But now I worship less at the altar of money and care a great deal more about social issues. Away at college, I started realizing that the conservative agenda might actually be…working against me. I’d experienced plenty of racism but started to notice it more, especially when hate crimes increased under Trump’s presidency. I myself was told to go back to my country on the New York City subway mere months after his inauguration. 
While my family in no way condones hate crimes, I know some believe racism has always been around and always will be around and we just have to deal with it: “It is what it is and we don’t need to talk about it.” They don’t have to tell me they dealt with far worse racism (like from neo-Nazis) and even violence when growing up in England. To them I probably seem like some oversensitive, brainwashed, East Coast, snowflake, Warby Parker-wearing, elitist, oatmeal-eating, whiney, Sex and the City-watching, naive, yoga class-attending victim, but I also think: why not address this stuff?
“That guy who told you to go back to your country was probably mentally off and he’s just one guy,” I was told. But I don’t want to minimize experiences like these any longer; I want to continue speaking out even if it makes my family uncomfortable because I care about more than us. Anyways, being a good, quiet Indian bookworm who hasn’t even been to India doesn’t stop people from being racist towards me. All people need to do is see my skin to make some sort of judgment.
Though racism has been around a long time and we’ve had plenty of racist presidents before Trump, Trump is direct in his racism and also grants these views legitimacy. In 2017, researchers at Tufts University found that , among test subjects, ""exposure to Trump's prejudiced statements made people more likely to write offensive things."" According to researchers at Stop AAPI Hate , there were over 2,500 incidents of bigotry against Asian-Americans between March and August 2020. Trump appears to validate the perpetrators' bigotry with terms like ""Chinese virus"". This year, the president also suggested that Black Lives Matter protesters demonstrating against police brutality and racism should be met with force. The longer I’m away from home, the less bridge-building I want to do with family members who are willing to overlook social issues.
“You need to come back to the Midwest and get a reality check,” I’ve heard. This year I became precisely the sort of person my parents warned me about: a liberal creative writing professor in New York with a diversity and inclusion agenda. It’s been hard striking it out on my own, but now, this Thanksgiving, this Nasty Woman feels emboldened. It’s getting easier to speak up with more women who look like me taking office. After all, instead of Mike Pence — a fellow Hoosier — as vice president, I get to see myself in Kamala Harris. If anything, I can inspire the next generation as that aunt out east with her dangerous ideas. "
231,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)",2020-11-26,"673 words","NEWS; Pg. 4","Julie Power",NA,"Brutal but beautiful: Stokes' list of quiet urban gems",FALSE,"Far from agreeing that the Brutalist style Sirius building should be slated for the wrecking ball as Treasurer Dominic Perrottet suggested this week, NSW planning minister Rob Stokes has put the love-it or hate-it apartment block on his competing list of 10 hidden architectural gems in Sydney.
Explaining his list, Mr Stokes said, ""One of the beautiful things about Sydney is that it isn't consistent and there's a contradiction of styles.""
His list reflects that. The oldest is the The Mint on Macquarie Street, a former hospital funded by rum sales that was known as the Sydney slaughterhouse because so many died from dysentery there. He admires the wide verandahs of the 1816 building as a major Australian contribution to international architecture.
It also includes Elizabeth Bay House, called the finest home in the colony after the house and grotto were finished in 1839.
He moves on to John James' 1968 Reader's Digest Building in Surry Hills built on the site of the Tooheys' stables, and then Bungan Castle, a Northern Beaches home that once hosted artist Norman Lindsay.
Stokes' list also includes the 2018 award-winning Punchbowl Mosque, described as architect Angelo Candalepas' ""modern masterpiece"" and features more than 100 domes.
Mr Perrottet's mischievous suggestion of taking a wrecking ball to iconic buildings like the MLC Centre, which he described as a hate crime, and Greenway Apartments, may be counterproductive.
According to NSW's State Architect Abbie Galvin, ""awesome"" public debates like these have actually saved buildings from destruction.
The most recent example was the Sirius. Other examples included the Finger Wharves, the State Theatre and public housing in Woolloomooloo. The Queen Victoria Building, now much loved, was described as a ""monstrosity"" in the late 1950s. Sydney's then Lord Mayor Harry Jensen had wanted to turn the location into a public park. Much of Paddington and McMahons Point's terraces would be history if it weren't for public debate.
Far from thinking the Treasurer should keep his nose out of architecture, Ms Galvin said ""we should be thanking"" him for encouraging public debate. ""Design is everyone's business,"" yet making decisions about what to save and what to keep should be more than about aesthetics, she said.
Ms Galvin agreed with Mr Stokes' view of the Cahill Expressway. ""We shouldn't just continue to hate it. We ultimately need a better vision of the Circular Quay and the harbour.""
Many architects challenged Mr Perrottet to ""put his money where his mouth is"" and fund the removal of the Cahill Expressway, long seen as a blight on Sydney.
""I challenge the Treasurer to pursue his quest for beauty and fund the next round of great public architecture and domain,"" wrote architect Shaun Carter in a Herald opinion piece yesterday.
Creating a city of architectural beauty, particularly with our public domain and public buildings, required a financial commitment, he wrote. ""What a gift to the city it would be. He could start with one of his top 10 constructions to be demolished, the Cahill Expressway.""
It would be expensive, as much as $3 billion, Mr Carter said, but it would be worth it if it resulted in an amazing public square in an area that already generates billions in tourist dollars.
Another equally attractive proposal was to turn it into a New York-style elevated high line running between the Domain and Barangaroo. ""Imagine having a family picnic right above Circular Quay. Just sitting there going, 'wow, this is public',"" he said.
Mr Stokes said Sydney had been the most intact Victorian city in the world in the 1960s.
""We consciously tore it to bits, we wanted to shed off our image as a staid, colonial outpost. We wanted to embrace modernity.
He said the idea of knocking everything down was as bad as the idea of saving everything. ""We need to consider whether buildings are useful and beautiful and can be adapted to a new use.""
Stokes also noted EY Building in George Street, St James' Church, Marrickville Library and Pyrmont's Union Street Terraces."

""Has @BubbaWallace apologised to all of those great Nascar drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?"" the president tweeted on Monday morning.
Referring to Nascar's decision to ban the display of the Confederate flag at its events, the president added: ""That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!""
In fact, Nascar's television ratings have risen over the last two months.
Trump's tweet echoed conspiracy theories aimed at Wallace. An FBI investigation found the driver was not a victim of a hate crime and the noose had been fashioned as a door pull last fall, long before his team had been assigned the garage at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama.
Quite why Wallace should have to apologise is a mystery: he did not find or report the noose. On Monday, one of Wallace's fellow drivers, Tyler Reddick, duly pushed back at the president.
""We don't need an apology,"" wrote Reddick. ""We did what was right and we will do just fine without your support.""

Wallace himself responded to Trump later on Monday in message on Twitter addressed to ""the next generation and little ones following my foot steps.""
Wallace urged those looking to him as an example to ""keep your head held high and walk proudly on the path you have chosen."" Wallace concluded the message, ""Always deal with the hate being thrown at you with LOVE. Love over hate every day. Love should come naturally as people are TAUGHT to hate. Even when it's HATE from the POTUS.""
At Monday's White House briefing, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said she had spoken to Trump ""and he said he was not making a judgment one way or the other. The intent of the tweet was to stand up for the men and women of Nascar and the fans.""
McEnany refused to say if Trump believes it was a mistake for Nascar to ban Confederate flags, adding that he was also offering a critique of a ""rush to judgment of the media to call something a hate crime when in fact the FBI report concluded this was not an intentional racist act"".
Pressed on the flag issue, the press secretary said: ""The president said he wasn't making a judgment one way or the other. You're focusing on one word at the very bottom of a tweet that's completely taking it out of context and neglecting the complete rush to judgment.""
McEnany was also questioned about Trump's demand for Wallace to apologise, given Nascar reported the noose.
She said: ""Well, look, the FBI, as I noted, concluded that this was not a hate crime and he believes it would go a long way if Bubba came out and acknowledged that as well.""
Paul Reid, a CBS reporter, interjected: ""He has!""
Last month, Wallace spoke of his frustration over the reaction to the FBI's investigation.
""I was relieved just like many others to know that it wasn't targeted towards me,"" Wallace told NBC's Today.
""But it's still frustrating to know that people are always going to test you and always just going to try and debunk you and that's what I'm trying to wrap my head around now, from people saying I'm a fake ... or that I reported it when it was information that was brought to me.""
The discovery of the noose came after Wallace campaigned successfully to ban the Confederate flag, seen as a racist symbol of the slave-owning era in the south, from Nascar venues. The removal was not welcomed by some fans, who paraded the flag outside the Talladega track.
At the race following the discovery of the noose, Wallace was given a stirring show of support by fellow drivers and the pit crews, who pushed his car to the front of the grid. Wallace broke down in tears after the gesture.
This is not the first time Trump has attacked a black athlete. In 2017 he called NFL players who knelt during the national anthem, the overwhelming majority of whom were black, ""sons of bitches"".
Later on Monday, the president turned his attention to the NFL's Washington Redskins and MLB's Cleveland Indians, which are both considering changing their nicknames, which are offensive to many Native Americans.
""They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Indians, like Elizabeth Warren, must be very angry right now!""
Before entering politics, Warren, now a Massachusetts senator and possible vice-presidential pick for Joe Biden, claimed to be Native American. Trump has mocked her with racist language.
The president has adopted an increasingly divisive tone as he trails Biden in the polls leading up to November's presidential election. In a speech on Friday night, he said America was under siege from ""far-left fascism"", a reference to the anti-racism protests that have swept the country since the police killing of George Floyd in May.
""Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,"" Trump said. ""Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.""
The president has also resisted changes to military bases named after Confederate generals, retweeted then deleted a video of a man shouting ""white power"", and said burning the American flag should be punishable by a year in jail."

Ted Lieu:
Today, Congressman Ted W. Lieu (D-Los Angeles County), along with Reps. Rob Woodall, Judy Chu and Pete Olson, led a bipartisan letter of 150 Members of Congress calling on Attorney General William Barr to publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Members also urged AG Barr to provide regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
In the letter, the Members wrote:
Dear Attorney General Barr:
Thank you for featuring the quote ""Coronavirus is no excuse for hate"" on the Department of Justice's hate crimes website. The COVID-19 pandemic affects all Americans and has wrought enormous pain in the United States. Some Americans are facing increased discrimination as a result of the pandemic. We write to draw particular attention to an increase in verbal and physical attacks as well as discrimination towards Asian Americans who have been wrongly blamed for the virus' spread. We respectfully request that you publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, and provide us with regular status updates regarding the steps the Department of Justice is taking and will take going forward to combat this behavior.
Asian Americans are not responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the United States; yet, since the start of the pandemic they have experienced continued harassment, violence, and discrimination. As of June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council reported 2,066 incidents of coronavirus-related discrimination. These and numerous news reports have documented cases ranging from the denial of services at stores to verbal harassment on the subway to physical assaults.
In one particularly egregious instance, an individual in Texas stabbed three Asian Americans, two of whom were children, because he thought they were infecting others with COVID-19. In March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Houston field office acknowledged the likelihood of a surge in hate crime incidents against Asian Americans.And most recently, a new Ipsos survey conducted for the Center for Public Integrity found that more than 30 percent of Americans have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for the coronavirus pandemic.
We appreciate the op-ed the Department placed in the Washington Examiner generally stating that hate crimes will be investigated and prosecuted. However, the dangers faced by the Asian American community today are very real and deserve a strong and specific response by our government. In fact, on May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledged its concerns ""over the increase in xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Americans) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and unanimously issued recommendations urging federal agencies reduce this sentiment.
We note that in the early 2000s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, the Bush Administration immediately took steps to prevent discrimination against Asian Americans by creating a community outreach team to monitor and document acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with the community.
Two years earlier following the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Administration had similarly sought to prevent attacks against Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian American communities by engaging with community leaders, conducting coordinated civil rights enforcement, and speaking out forcefully. While these prior responses were not perfect, they represented an important effort to acknowledge and address the specific discrimination.
Despite the fear present within the community, each and every day Asian Americans help to combat COVID-19. While Asian Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. population, 17.1 percent of active medical physicians are Asian American. Similarly, Asian Americans are serving our country by working as nurses, health aides, and in many other essential occupations. Asian Americans are just as American as any other group of people in our country.
We respectfully request that you, as head of the Department of Justice, forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias to send an unambiguous message to all Americans that discrimination against this community is un-American and will not be tolerated. Further, we would ask that you update us regularly as to what steps the Department has taken to address our concerns. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

The sedition statute doesnt need evidence of a plot to overthrow the government, the memo read. It instead could be used when a defendant tries to oppose the governments authority by force.
Attorney General William Barr was telling his U.S. lawyers to bring federal cases in protest-related violence whenever they can, putting a grip on cases even if a felon could be tried instead in state court. Federal indictments often result in longer jail terms; sedition alone could lead to up to 20 years imprisonment.
The notice informed that as a hypothetical example a group has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force, but the real thing took place in Portland, Oregon, at clashes that erupted night after night between police and protestors.
Justice authorities also explored if it could pursue either criminal or civil rights charges against city officials there, agent Kerri Kupec told The AP. She would not say if the cases were still being noted.
The Trump administrations handling on protest violence has already led to over 300 apprehensions on federal crimes in the protests since the death of George Floyd. An AP analysis of the data shows that while many people are accused of violent crimes such as arson for hurling Molotov cocktails and burning police cars and assault for injuring law enforcement, others are not. It caused to criticism that minimum some apprehensions are a politically motivated effort to stymie demonstrations.
Charles Sunwabe, who represents an Erie, Pennsylvania, man accused of lighting a fire at a coffee shop after a May 30 protest said, The speed at which this whole thing was moved from state court to federal court is stunning and unbelievable. Its an attempt to intimidate these demonstrators and to silence them.
Some issues are seen as trumped-up and should not be in federal court, lawyers say, including a teenager accused of civil disorder for claiming online we are not each others enemy, only enemy is 12, a reference to law enforcement.
The administration forfeited on the protests and an aggressive federal response to showcase what President Donald Trump says is his law-and-order prowess, stating he is countering rising crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump rejected protesters and played up the violence around protests, though the majority of them are peaceful.
Pockets of violence happened in Rochester, New York; Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Federal authorities reached to Kenosha, Wisconsin, after large protests and chaos after the firing of Jacob Blake and the gunning down of two protesters and later arrest of a 17-year-old in their deaths. Notably, that teenager has not been charged with any federal crimes. Neither was a man charged of fatal firing of a protestor in Louisville after the death of Breonna Taylor.
As Barr has gone after protest-related violence targeted at police, he debated that there is seldom a reason to open sweeping investigations into the practices of police departments. The Justice Department, started many civil rights investigations into individual cases. Barr has said he does not believe there is systemic racism in police departments, even though Black people are disproportionately more likely to be killed by police, and public attitudes over police reforms have shifted.
Federal engagements in local cases are often. Officials all over the country turn to the Justice Department for violent crime and gang cases where offenders could face much stiffer federal sentences and there is no probation.
Police chiefs in many cities have showed to the significance of their relationships with federal prosecutors to bring charges that can result in long prison sentences to drive down violent crime.
Even before the chaos in 2020, the Justice Department was stepping in to bring alterations in states where the government thinks justice is not being fully pursued by local prosecutors. In January, for example, the department brought federal hate crime charges against a woman charged of slapping three Orthodox Jewish women in one of several apparently anti-Semitic attacks reported throughout New York during Hanukkah.
It is not known ifprotest-related arrests will continue apace. Protests have lessened, though not necessarily because of the federal charges. Wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South have lowered some of the conflict.
As many local prosecutors have removed many low-level protest arrests, some are still coming down hard. A Pennsylvania judge set bail at $1 million for about a dozen people in a protest that followed the death of a knife-wielding man by police.
Even some Democrats, which got District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, have called for the Justice Department to pursue federal charges against violent demonstrators, going as far as accusing the administration of declining to prosecute rioters. Washingtons Metropolitan Police Department apprehended 42 people one August weekend after a protest left a trail of vandalism. But prosecutors said the arrest paperwork did not identify specific offences connected to individual felon.
The federal confrontation with Bowser looked counterintuitive, though Trump has a history of squaring off against the mayor.
About one-third of the federal protest-connected issues are in Portland, for crimes such as assaulting a deputy U.S. marshal with a baseball bat, setting fires and setting off explosives at the federal courthouse and tossing rocks at officers.
Three made Boogaloo members, who use the loose movements name as a slang term for a second civil war or collapse of civilization, were accused with owning of a homemade bomb and causing protest in Las Vegas.
An El Paso, Texas, man got charged of promoting hate speech, posting a video online with a racist epithet and making threatening comments to Black Lives Matter protesters while holding a military-style rifle at his feet. A Minnesota man was charged of helping burn down a police precinct headquarters there after Floyds death.
But other matters simply do not belong in federal court.
A 35-year-old Isaiah Willoughby, whos charged of arson to the outside of a police precinct, received 5 years jail term if indicted of arson in federal court in Seattle. He could be looking at about a year behind bars in state court, where his lawyer said the case belongs.
Assistant federal public defender Dennis Carroll said, This is city property that has been destroyed and you have a local prosecutors office that is ready and willing and able to charge these cases in state court, but the federal government is attempting to emphasize these protest-related crimes for whatever agenda they are seeking to pursue.
Carroll charged federal officials of using the cases to try to make the protests seem more violent and disruptive than they really were.
Federal inspectors in September accepted to remove the case on a man who authorities said was seem with a Molotov cocktail in his backpack after he and other protesters were arrested in May for blocking traffic in Jacksonville, Florida. Video showed that 27-year-old Ivan Zecher was wrongfully arrested because he was actually on the sidewalk not in the street meaning inspectors could not go ahead their issue as informed by, Zechers lawyer Marcus Barnett.
Barnett said, There is absolutely an agenda here to blow these out of proportion, make these look more serious or more sinister than it is. This is the Justice Department, from the top, furthering an agenda that has nothing to do with justice. 2020 Legal Monitor Worldwide."

He is accused of intimidation, making threats, hate crimes, and disorderly conduct. He is found guilty and his punishment includes exclusion from the community, suspension of his academic privileges, a ban on taking leadership roles in campus organizations, mandatory meetings with appropriate officials to learn about correct ways of thinking and speaking, and the presentation of a formal written apology, to be submitted in draft form 'for approval.' Readers would be excused for assuming that this occurred in some backward, repressive dictatorship or totalitarian regime, but these troubling events took place at an American University. 
 Austin Tong, a senior at Fordham University in New York State, posted two messages on his Instagram account. The first, on June 3, was a comment[2]about the 'nonchalant societal reaction' to the killing of David Dorn, a black, retired St. Louis Police officer. His second post, a day later, was a photo of himself holding his lawfully owned AR-15 rifle at his off-campus home. This was captioned, 'Don't tread on me,' followed by the emojis of the American and Communist Chinese flags and ahashtag[3]'commonly used by Chinese citizens to avoid censorship of online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre.' Mr. Tong is a Chinese-American who arrived in the United States as a six-year-old immigrant. He explained[4]that his second post was made to commemorate the 31st anniversary of the suppressed 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement.According to Mr. Tong, the university[5]'sent safety officers at midnight to interrogate me all over a simple picture of a lawfully owned gun.'Keith Eldredge, Fordham University's Dean of Students and Assistant Vice President, followed up byadvising[6]that he was initiating an investigation for bias/hate crimes, threats/intimidation, and disorderly conduct, based on these 'posts on social media related to the current racial issues in the country and political issues in China, including one in which you were holding an automatic weapon.' Fordham University - a private educational institution that is not bound by the First Amendment - nonetheless professes its commitment to free speech and expressive rights. For example, its mission statement[7]'guarantees the freedom of inquiry required by rigorous thinking and the quest for truth.' The university's Demonstration Policy[8]opens with the following: 'By its very nature, the University is a place where ideas and opinions are formulated and exchanged. Each member of the University has a right to freely express their positions and to work for their acceptance whether they assent to or dissent from existing situations in the University or society.' Similarly, Fordham's policy on 'Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes[9]' claims the University: Values freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas. The expression of controversial ideas and differing views is a vital part of University discourse. Although the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others, it may not constitute a hate crime or bias-related incident. While this value of openness protects the expression of controversial ideas, it does not protect or condone harassment or expressions of bias or hate aimed at individuals or groups that violate the Student Code of Conduct. Regardless of these high-minded affirmations, the University concluded that Mr. Tong's posts - devoid of threats, violence, intimidation, coercion, or harassment - violated the university rules on 'Bias and/or Hate Crimes' and 'Threats/Intimidation.' A July 14 2020 letter[10]from Keith Eldredge (copied to the 'Department of Public Safety') outlined the sanctions. Mr. Tong would be barred from the campus for the duration of his degree program. He was banned from representing the university or running for any student office or position. He would be required to attend instruction and complete activities on 'implicit bias,' including a meeting with staff of the 'multicultural affairs' office. He would have to submit a mandatory 'apology letter,' to be approved by the university and a failure to comply would result in the university suspending or expelling him. Perversely, the social media backlash to these innocuous posts has itself resulted in threats, intimidation, and potential bias/hate crimes against Austin Tong. It will be interesting to see whether Fordham University will enforce the same rules and policies against the activists from the university that 'flooded the comments section' of his posts.In the same way that the 'quest for truth' supported characterizing his firearm indiscriminately as an 'automatic weapon,' the university's commitments to 'freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas' protected Austin Tong,who was[11]'forcibly silenced, faced verbal and assaulting harassment from mobs, and subjected to Soviet-style interrogation and punishment.' Despite this, and the possibility that his academic career will be marred indefinitely due to these disciplinary actions, he has been steadfast in his defense of his constitutional rights. In a video for the NRA, Austin Tong describes his decision to purchase a gun, adding that '[h]ere in America, we have our right to keep and bear arms. This is what keeps America free.' Actually, Austin, it is patriots like you - who fight to protect our constitutional freedoms - that keep America free.

It's a skill required for just about every profession--the ability to identify, analyze, and resolve conflicts. Starting in fall 2021, Buffalo State College will be the first in the State University of New York (SUNY) system and in Western New York to offer graduate instruction in just that area when it introduces an interdisciplinary master of science in conflict analysis and resolution. The college will also be developing a graduate certificate program in the same field.
Buffalo State's new School of Arts and Sciences, which also launches in fall 2021, will house the interdisciplinary programs that the New York State Education Department and SUNY recently approved.
The 30-credit-hour master's program and developing 12-credit-hour certificate program will address the need for highly skilled conflict resolvers to work in myriad professions, including business, government, education, health care, criminal justice, ministry, and labor relations.
""The closest school that currently offers such a master's is Cornell University,"" said Peter Yacobucci, associate professor of political science and public administration, who serves as co-coordinator of the program with Clairissa Breen, assistant professor of criminal justice. ""And its program more narrowly focuses on labor relations.""
""Conflict analysis and resolution is an innovative program that relies on one of the skills employers most often say they seek--the ability to assess conflict, resolve it, and ensure it doesn't reoccur,"" said Buffalo State Provost Jim Mayrose. ""I'm thrilled that we will be the first SUNY school to offer such a program. Not only will it provide graduates with a highly marketable set of skills; it will also provide a terrific opportunity for cross-disciplinary collaboration on campus.""
Participating faculty currently represent nine academic programs or departments: Adult Education, Business, Creative Studies, Criminal Justice, Economics and Finance, Educational Leadership, International Relations, Political Science, and Sociology.
""It's apparent that conflict resolution is a huge problem in multiple fields,"" said Yacobucci, who studies conflict in the political realm, including the increase in hyper-partisanship in the United States. Meanwhile, Breen describes herself as a ""conflict criminologist,"" with a focus on hate crimes and terrorism.
""What we found is that everyone was working on conflict resolution within their own areas,"" Yacobucci said. ""We thought, Why don't we put together a program that combines the theory and methods for handling and resolving conflict that can be applied across disciplines and fields?""
Three years ago, former Buffalo State Provost Melanie Perreault asked Yacobucci to help shape the program and to identify faculty members in other departments who could teach the relevant courses.
""Every single person I approached was willing to be a part of it,"" Yacobucci said. ""It's been a cooperative process. We're really excited about getting it started.""
Breen, who joined the criminal justice faculty in fall 2016 and is certified as an anti-terrorism specialist, was a natural fit to serve as co-coordinator. When she heard about the need for faculty members to lead this burgeoning program, she didn't hesitate.
""Put the word 'conflict' in front of me, and I raise my hand,"" she said.
The audience for the program includes both current undergraduate students who would like to continue their education by becoming experts at resolving conflicts and professionals wanting to obtain strategies for conflict analysis and resolution that they can apply to their jobs, their communities, and the world at large.
As she and Yacobucci continue to design the curriculum and market the program this academic year, Breen said, they will focus on combining real-world experiences and academic theories. This will ensure that students can understand the origin of conflicts and how they can decrease them.
""Resolution becomes the most important part of the equation,"" she said.

Coca-Cola, Levis, Unilever, Pepsi, Best Buy, Hershey, Diageo, Verizon and many others have halted advertising on Facebook - with some going even further by nixing ads on Instagram and Twitter as well.
The reason, these companies state, is that social media platforms aren't doing enough policing of posts on their sites. Hate speech is rampant lately and posts are vicious and very personal.
It's interesting, knowing that in a one-on-one encounter this wouldn't likely happen. It's the keyboard curse; it makes people feel powerful.
In January, New York Senator David Carlucci introduced a Social Media Hate Speech Accountability Act bill, after a number of hate crimes around the country. It states:
The Social Media Hate Speech Accountability Act will put in place best practices that social media companies and other online platforms must follow when taking complaints about hate speech. Hate speech is defined as speech or imagery, targeting a protected class, such as race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity or physical, mental or intellectual disability. Under the bill, it is required that the platform remove hate speech within 24 hours after a complaint has been reported.
And, if a social media platform doesn't remove reported hate speech either intentionally or negligently, the State's Attorney General can take action against the provider. The Attorney General can seek up to $1 million for a violation and can increase damages up to three times that, if the company has engaged in a pattern or practice of not removing such hate speech.
Unfortunately, seven months later, it is still in committee.
Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who to date, has lost $7.2 billion over the ad boycott, has said again and again that his platform allows free speech. He doesn't think that the company should be the ""arbiter of truth."" After brands got involved, he announced to CNN that he would take steps to protect data and fix what he called a ""breach of trust.""
Will it take losing billions to realize that free speech should not include hate speech against any one religion, skin color, gender preference and so forth? I believe it will take social media influencers and users to take a stand as well - to let the Big 3 of social media know that it isn't just. Social media was born to bring people together ... the Book of Faces, aka, Facebook. Not to further tear us apart.

On May 25, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man accused of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, took his final breath while handcuffed and pinned under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. 
A New York Times video shows Floyd - distressed yet compliant - being arrested and later pinned face down on the pavement by three other officers. Momentarily, officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, forced his knee on Floyd's neck, pressing down with the weight of his body for a duration of eight minutes and 46 seconds, according to a complaint filed against him.
While at Chauvin's knee, Floyd continuously said he couldn't breathe as he gasped for air. Chauvin's knee remained on Floyd's neck and didn't retract from Floyd's unconscious body until the paramedics arrived. 
Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 
A day later, the Minneapolis Police Department fired all four of the officers involved in Floyd's arrest and on June 3, Chauvin's charge for third-degree murder was elevated to second-degree. On the same day, the three other former Minneapolis police officers involved were charged with aiding and abetting murder.
Still, these repercussions have not been accepted among thousands across the globe as this is just one of the most recent black lives taken away by police for unjust reasons. 
Since Floyd's death, those in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have taken to protests and social media platforms to communicate messages against police brutality, racism and racial injustice. 
The names of other black lives taken by the police have also circulated on the internet and protests including Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery - both unarmed and shot by police officers or other white people. 
Hundreds of people have protested in the streets of San Diego over the past weeks, showing solidarity for the cause - an action powerful to society and harmful to public health.
While the amount of support shown via protests has been astonishing, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the county continues to escalate. The fight toward social justice is necessary and should continue but the silent fight toward a pandemic-free world should too. 
Now is the time to inform, educate, correct and prevent in a manner that doesn't put public health at risk. If you are set on protesting, consider reading these suggestions on how to protest safely.
For the rest, outlined below are a few ways you can show your support for black lives without running the risk of further coronavirus propagation at large protests.

""13th"" (2016) directed by Ava DuVernay.
""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) directed by Robert Mulligan.
""The Hate U Give"" (2018) directed by George Tillman Jr.
Politics aside, this movement is about human lives. 
With these titles and recommendations, my hope is that you'll join the ongoing battle toward dismantling racism. It is only a matter of time before the Instagram posts and tweets about protests and the black lives that have been taken away will vanish. Once that happens, it'll be up to you to continue this fight on and offline.

James insisted he had never supported revenge attacks against law enforcement but had repeatedly seen police racially profile his community.

Staff members of The Wall Street Journal sent a letter to newsroom leaders on Monday accusing the paper’s former editor in chief, Gerard Baker, who has been an editor at large at The Journal since leaving the top job in 2018, of violating rules that apply to those who work on the news side.
The letter, from the board of the Independent Association of Publishers’ Employees, the union that represents Journal staff members, criticized a column by Mr. Baker on race and accused him of tweeting in a way that went against the paper’s social media policy.
While Mr. Baker expresses opinions in a weekly column, called Editor at Large, The Journal had classified him as a member of the news division, just as it had during his five-and-a-half-year run as the editor in chief.
On Tuesday, The Journal reassigned Mr. Baker, formally making him a member of the opinion staff, which is led by the editorial page editor, Paul A. Gigot, and is run separately from the news department. Those who work on the opinion side do not have to abide by the rules that apply to the paper’s news reporters and editors. They have more leeway in The Journal’s pages and on social media.
The Journal said the move had been in the works before the I.A.P.E. union sent the letter. “Conversations about Gerry’s move to Opinion have been underway for some time,” a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “His new, expanded role will include podcasts and other projects.” Mr. Baker did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The I.A.P.E.’s letter was addressed to Matt Murray, Mr. Baker’s successor as editor in chief, and Almar Latour, who last month was named publisher of The Journal and the chief executive of its parent company, Dow Jones, which is part of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.
The letter singled out a May 15 column by Mr. Baker headlined “The Often Distorted Reality of Hate Crime in America.” He led it with a description of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot while jogging in Georgia after he was pursued by white men, a killing that was captured on video.

The British-born, Oxford-educated Mr. Baker led The Journal at a time when its staff produced an award-winning investigation that exposed fraudulent claims by the health care tech company Theranos. On his watch, the paper was also at the forefront of reporting on payments involving President Trump and women who said they had once had sexual relationships with him.
His tenure was also marked by unrest. In late-night emails, Mr. Baker accused reporters and editors of adding commentary to their coverage of Mr. Trump, and the staff pushed back, accusing him in an all-hands meeting of going easy on the president. More than a dozen journalists left the paper for The Washington Post and The New York Times.
The Journal staff members’ criticism of their former boss came in the wake of the resignations of high-ranking editors at The Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer. James Bennet, the former editorial page editor at The Times, and Stan Wischnowski, the former executive editor of The Inquirer, stepped down after large numbers of staff members complained about their leadership at a time of worldwide protests against racism and police violence prompted by the killing in Minneapolis last month of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned to the ground by a white police officer.
The letter from the Journal union also included complaints about Mr. Baker’s opinion columns for The Times of London, noting that news-side staff members are barred from contributing opinion essays to other publications. Recent headlines on those columns, the letter noted, included “Big Tech Is Blatantly Biased Against Trump” and “The Obama Halo Is in Danger of Slipping.”
In closing, the letter said the paper should hold Mr. Baker to the standards that apply to everyone else on the news side. Now that The Journal has put him in the opinion department, he can follow a different rule book.

Staff members of The Wall Street Journal sent a letter to newsroom leaders on Monday accusing the paper's former editor in chief, Gerard Baker, who has been an editor at large at The Journal since leaving the top job in 2018, of violating rules that apply to those who work on the news side. 
 The letter, from the board of the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, the union that represents Journal staff members, criticized a column by Mr. Baker on race and accused him of tweeting in a way that went against the paper's social media policy.
 While Mr. Baker expresses opinions in a weekly column, called Editor at Large, The Journal had classified him as a member of the news division, just as it had during his five-and-a-half-year run as the editor in chief.
 On Tuesday, The Journal reassigned Mr. Baker, formally making him a member of the opinion staff, which is led by the editorial page editor, Paul A. Gigot, and is run separately from the news department. Those who work on the opinion side do not have to abide by the rules that apply to the paper's news reporters and editors. They have more leeway in The Journal's pages and on social media.
 The Journal said the move had been in the works before the I.A.P.E. union sent the letter. ''Conversations about Gerry's move to Opinion have been underway for some time,'' a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. ''His new, expanded role will include podcasts and other projects.'' Mr. Baker did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
 The I.A.P.E.'s letter was addressed to Matt Murray, Mr. Baker's successor as editor in chief, and Almar Latour, who last month was named publisher of The Journal and the chief executive of its parent company, Dow Jones, which is part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire.
 The letter singled out a May 15 column by Mr. Baker headlined ''The Often Distorted Reality of Hate Crime in America.'' He led it with a description of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was shot while jogging in Georgia after he was pursued by white men, a killing that was captured on video.
 The I.A.P.E. criticized the column, saying it ''posits the highly controversial argument that black people commit more hate crimes than white people'' and adding that to '''prove' that he uses only his own single weighted statistical calculation, with no attribution or context from experts either to support the idea or provide contrary views.'' The letter also flagged several posts from Mr. Baker's Twitter account that, it said, violated the paper's social media policy.

During the demonstration, police officers established a ""skirmish line"" to prevent protesters from ""taking over the street"", according to the police. The police claimed that Massri ""became irate"" as an officer ""was guiding her up the street"", adding that the officer ""grabbed"" her after she ""continued to remain in the roadway"" and that she punched the officer ""in the right bicep with a closed fist"".
Massri was arrested and charged with battery, resisting an officer with violence and disorderly conduct.
She was taken to a Miami-Dade County Corrections and Rehabilitation center where officers removed her hijab forcibly, according to Hassan Shibly, the chief executive director of CAIR Florida, a civil liberties and advocacy organization.
""She was wrongfully and unconstitutionally photographed without her hijab, and it was made accessible to countless media outlets,"" he said
Omar Saleh, an attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy group, slammed the incident.
He said that removing religious head coverings during booking procedures — whether a hijab, yumalke, or turban — is a ""severe violation of religious freedoms"", NVS News reported.
""It's not isolated. We've heard it before, and there have been lawsuits filed across the nation to rule this practice as unconstitutional,"" Saleh said, citing a few jurisdictions in California and Portland, Maine.
""This isn't treatment that's unique to Muslims, but it's one where Muslim women who wear hijabs certainly bear the brunt of,"" Saleh said, adding, ""There needs to be change.""
A Muslim woman filed a federal civil lawsuit in Yonkers, New York, in April where she said she was forced to remove her hijab before taking her booking photo last year.
Ihsan Malkawai was arrested on ""false allegations of abuse"", which were later came out unfounded. She was kept in custody without her hijab for 36 hours.
The number of Islamophobic incidents in the United States has spiked following the election of President Donald Trump, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading Muslim advocacy group.
Critics say that Trump's rhetoric and policies against Muslims before and after his election has emboldened far-right groups and promoted anti-Muslim hate crimes across the country.
Some scholars say Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries was aimed at spreading Islamophobia and demonizing Muslims.

Grinnell resident Michael Williams, 44, has been identified as the man whose body was discovered charred in a Kellogg ditch on Wednesday afternoon after Jasper County authorities responded to reports of a fire in the area. Police are investigating Williams' death as a homicide, but have not released further details on the case.
According to Williams' Facebook page, he was originally from Syracuse, New York, where many of his family members still live. He turned 44 on Sept. 10, 2020, nine days ago. His mother wrote in the introduction to a GoFundMe for funeral expenses (linked below), ""Mike was a big man! He was a loving man, that loved his children and extended family. Michael was the life of the party and loved to dance. He did not deserve to be treated like this! He was our Gentle Giant!""
College President Anne Harris sent an all-campus email Saturday morning informing students that Campus Safety would be providing rides around Grinnell to students in the wake of the news. As of yet, the College has made no further comment on Williams' death.
People wishing to support the Williams family during this time can donate towards his funeral expenses here and here.
The death of Williams, a Black man from Grinnell - a city reported as 2 percent Black and 91.9 percent white in the 2010 census - comes at the close of a summer of highly publicized violence against Black Americans. Local police have not released any information regarding whether Williams' killing is being investigated as a hate crime.

249,"./Downloads/Hate Crime_501/Files (250).DOCX","Associated Press State & Local",2020-10-20,"845 words","DOMESTIC NEWS; POLITICAL NEWS; STATE AND REGIONAL","JANIE HAR, Associated Press",NA,"San Francisco officials let people sue over racist 911 calls",FALSE,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Fed up with white people calling 911 about people of color selling water bottles, barbecuing or otherwise going about their lives, San Francisco leaders unanimously approved hate crime legislation giving the targets of those calls the ability to sue the caller.
The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday on the Caution Against Racial and Exploitative Non-Emergencies Act, also known as the CAREN legislation. It's a nod to a popular meme using the name “Karen” to describe an entitled white woman whose actions stem from her privilege, such as using police to target people of color.
All 11 supervisors signed on to the legislation, guaranteeing its passage, despite criticism that the name is sexist and divisive. It comes amid a national reckoning on race sparked by the police killings of Black Americans and instances where white people called for officers to investigate people of color.
“We don’t want what happened to Emmett Till in 1955, or the long history of false accusations of black men and boys in this country, due to weaponizing law enforcement, to threaten, terrorize, and sometimes even kill them, to ever happen again,” said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who introduced the legislation and is Black.
“I really want to emphasize that 911 is not a customer service line for someone's racist behavior,"" he said.
Walton was the only supervisor to speak. Till was a Black teenager beaten to death in 1955 after accusations by a white woman who later admitted to lying.
In May, Amy Cooper, a white woman, called 911 from Manhattan’s Central Park, falsely claiming that a Black man — who had politely asked her to leash her dog — was threatening her. She has been charged with filing a false police report.
In San Francisco, a white couple was criticized on social media after video was widely shared of them questioning a Filipino American stenciling “Black Lives Matter” on a retaining wall in front of his home in June. They later called police.
James Juanillo said he chose yellow chalk to match the color of the house. When the couple approached him, they repeatedly demanded to know if it was his home because he was defacing private property.
“They tried to cast it as a criminal scene,” he said. “It was me calmly applying chalk, not spray paint, not in the middle of the night but very deliberately. The only thing that was missing was a pinot grigio.”
Supporters of the legislation say it is crushing to be confronted by police because someone saw you as a threat, possibly as a criminal or as not belonging. It's especially terrifying for Black people, whose encounters with police could end in violence.
“This is not hyperbole,"" said Brittni Chicuata, chief of staff for San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. “This is an established pattern reflected in the disparate treatment of Black people and other people of color in our city and in our country.""
Other places have moved to make placing racist 911 calls a hate crime. California's governor recently signed a measure making the crime a misdemeanor punishable by jail time and a fine. New York approved legislation allowing the victims of racist 911 calls to sue.
The San Francisco legislation gives people the right to sue a 911 caller in civil court, and supporters hope it will make some think twice before turning to police. The discrimination need not be only racial; it can also be due to the person’s sex, age, religion, disability, gender identity, weight or height.
The legislation does not spell out the standards needed to sue. But it notes that qualifying calls are those that caused the person to feel harassed or embarrassed; damaged the person’s reputation or business prospects; or forced the person from an area where they had a lawful right to be.
The board has received written complaints from eight people — several whose names have different spellings of Karen — saying they support the legislation but object to its moniker, which they call sexist and ageist.it
Vic Vicari wrote that the insensitive use of the name “as a general purpose term of disapproval for middle age white women needs to stop.” Carynn Silva said she loves the name her mom gave her and called it a racist term against white women. Caren Batides asked if the supervisor would want his name mocked.
“Yes, I am named Karen, and I do speak up for injustices on a regular occasion,” Karen Shane wrote. “So could we attempt at coming up with some other acronym that doesn’t vilify a whole group of people named Karen/Caryn/Caren?”
Reached by phone, Shane, who lives in a San Francisco Bay Area suburb and describes herself as a middle-aged white woman, readily pokes fun at her first name and said she’s aware that even complaining about it is something that a “Karen” would do. But she feels the supervisor didn’t need to cheapen what she agrees is important legislation.
“By using the name CAREN, he’s just perpetuating a racial divide,"" she said. “Granted it’s not a protected class, but it’s somebody’s name.”
Walton has dismissed the concerns, saying the legislation does not refer to any individual."
